1,"Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and the Saviour Jesus Christ:","Simon Peter, Isu Krista suok le tirko chun: Isu Krista kan Pathien le Sandamtu felna leia ringna hlutak kan chang ang chang vehai kuomah:"
2,Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;,Pathien le ei Lalpa Isu hrietnaa chun in chungah lunginsietna le inremna sukpungin um raw se.
3,"seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue;","Ama ropuina le ṭhatna zâra a mi kotu, a chanchin hriet leiin a Pathien thilthawtheinain hringna le Pathien ngaisakna kawnga chun thil po po a mi pêk sih a."
4,"whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.","Chuong zâra chun a thutiem hlutak le ropui nasatakhai chu a mi pêk a nih, chuongchun, châkna leia khawvêla sietna hung um hi tlân suok sanin, chuong thutiem hlutak le ropui nasatakhai lei chun Pathien nungchang inṭâwmpui ve thei in tih."
5,"Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge;","Anih, chu chu lei tak chun taimâk hrim hrim insuoin, in ringnaa chun ṭhatna inṭhangtir unla, in ṭhatnaa chun hrietna,"
6,and in your knowledge self-control; and in your self-control patience; and in your patience godliness;,"in hrietnaa chun insûmna, in insûmnaa chun selna, in selnaa chun Pathien ngaisakna,"
7,and in your godliness brotherly kindness; and in your brotherly kindness love.,"in Pathien ngaisaknaa chun unau- hai hmangaina, in unauhai hmangai- naa chun hmangaina inṭhangtir ro."
8,"For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Chuong chu in ta a na, a pung pei si chun, ei Lalpa Isu Krista hrietna kawnga hin zawmthaw lo le ra nuom takin a siem cheu a nih."
9,"For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.","Tûkhawm chuong thil nei naw chu mitdel a na, hnaitaka mi chau a hmu thei a, hi hmaa a suolhai sâwpfai pêkna chu a theinghil ta sih a."
10,"Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble:","Chuleiin, unauhai, a kona le a thlangna cheu chu sukdet dingin taimâk insuo nâwkzuol ro; chuong chu in thaw chun ieng tik khawm tlu naw ti niu;"
11,for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.,"chuongchun, Isu Krista ei Lalpa le Sandamtu chatuon rama lûtna chu nasataka inhmutir nîng in tih."
12,"Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is with you.","Chuleiin, chuong thil chu hrein, thutak in kuoma uma chun in det dea chu chuong thil chu inhrietthartir cheu ka tum zing hlak a."
13,"And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;","Chun, hi bâwktêa ka um sûng po hin nangni hrietpuiin chawkhar rawp cheu ṭhain ka hriet a nih,"
14,"knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me.",ei Lalpa Isu Kristain a min hriettir ang khan ka bâwktê sie hmang hun chu tlung vak a tih ti ka hriet a.
15,"Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.","Anih, ka fe suok hnunga chuong thil chu in hriet zing rawp theina dingin thâwng ka tih."
16,"For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista thil- thawthei zie le a hung nâwkna thu chu kan inhriettir lai cheu khan, tienami vartaka ngaituo suok elhai zâwm kan ni nawh a, a ropuina hmutuhai kan ni lem in sâwnnaw."
17,"For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:","Ama chun Pa Pathien kuoma inthawkin chawimawina le ropuina a hmuh a, chu lai chun ropuina nasataka inthawk chun hieng ang râwl hi a kuomah a hung tlung a, “Hi hi ka Naupa dittak, ka ilâwm bêk bêk a nih,” tiin."
18,"and this voice we ourselves heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.","Chun, tlâng inthienga kan um laiin chu râwl chu vâna inthawka hung suok keini ngeiin kan hriet a nih."
19,"And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:","Chun, hrillâwkna thu det nâwkzuol chu kan nei a nih, khuo a hung var a, sikhawvar chu in lungrila a hung suok hmakhat, hmun inthima khâwnvar var ngaisak anga in ngaisak chun thaw ṭhang in tih."
20,"knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.",Pathien Lekha Thu hrillâwk hrim hrim hi mâniin hrilfie ding a ni nawh ti hre hmasa phawt unla.
21,"For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.","Thu hrillâwk hrim hrim hi mihriem thua suok a ni ngai si nawh a, mihaiin Thlarau Inthieng tirin, Pathien kuoma inthawkin an hril lem hlak a nih."
