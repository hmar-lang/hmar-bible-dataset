1,"This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting you in remembrance;","Dittakhai, tuta in kuoma ka ziek hi ka lekhathawn pahnina a na, chuonga chun, inhrietthartir ding cheuin, in lungril inthieng ka chawk- har ve ve a,"
2,"that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles:","zâwlnei inthienghai thu hrillâwk le, in tirkohai baua Lalpa le San- damtu thupêk chu in hriet zingna dingin."
3,"knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts,","Hi hi hre hmasa unla, ni nu- hnungahai chun nuisantuhai chu, anni châkna anga umin, nuisan pumin hung an ta,"
4,"and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.","“A hung nâwkna ding thutiem chu khâwlai am a um a? Siem tîra inthawkin iengkim a um pângngai angin chi thlatuhai ininnghil nia inthawk ta kha a la um pei annâwm,” la tîng an tih."
5,"For this they wilfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God;","Hieng hi an theinghil tehlêm hlak si; Pathien thuin tienlaiin vânhai a hung um a, hnuoi khawm tuia inthawka siemin tui laia hai chun a lo um a;"
6,"by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:","chu tuihai vêk chun chu laia khawvêl um chu a chîm a, a bohmang tah a, ti hi;"
7,"but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.","nisienlakhawm, tuta vânhai le hnuoi umhai hi chu thu bawk lei chun Pathien ngaisak naw mihai rorêl le bohmang nia dingin khêkin, meia dinga inkhâwl khâwm a ni tah."
8,"But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.","Nisienlakhawm, dittakhai, hi thu bau khat hi theinghil naw ro, Lalpa ngai chun ni khat hi kum sâng khat ang a na, kum sâng khat khawm hi ni khat ang a nih, ti hi."
9,"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.","Mi ṭhenkhatin muonga an ruot angin, Lalpa chu a thutiem kawnga chu a muong nawh; tukhawm bo- hmang loa mi po po sim ditpuiin, nangni tiengah a dâwthei a ni lem."
10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up.","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpa ni chu inru angin hung tlung ngei a tih; chu nia chun vânhai chu nasataka inriin bohmang a ta, thil bulhai chu meia emhmangin um tâng a ta, hnuoi le a sûnga sinthaw umhai hi kâng hmang a tih."
11,"Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living and godliness,",Chuong thilhai chu chuong anga bohmang vawng ding a nih ti in hriet leiin um dân inthieng le Pathien ngaisak kawnga chun mi ieng ang am in ni ding a na?
12,"looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?","Pathien Ni hung tlung ding hun chu ṭhahnemngaitakin beisei zing ro. Chu ni chu a tlung chun vânhai chu kângin bohmang a ta, thil bulhai khawm chu meia emtuiin um tâng an tih."
13,"But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.","Nisienlakhawm, a thutiem ang chun vân tharhai le hnuoi thar, a sûnga felna umhai chu ei beisei a nih."
14,"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.","Chuleiin, dittakhai, chuong ang thilhai chu in beisei leiin, in- thiengnawna kai lo le sawisêl boin thlamuongtaka in um a hmu theina ding cheuin, taimâk insuo ro."
15,"And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you;","Chun, ei Lalpa dawtheizie chu sandamnaa ruot ro; ei unaupa dittak Paula khawmin, a kuoma varna pêk ang peia in kuoma a ziek ang khan."
16,"as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; wherein are some things hard to be understood, which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.","A lekhathawn po poa chun chuong thu chu hrilin, chuong ang bawkin a ziek a nih; chuonga chun thu hriet intak takhai a um a, chuong chu mi var naw le mi det nawhaiin, Pathien Lekha Thu dang an ngai kawi angin an ngai kawi a, mâni le mâni an insukbohmang pha hlak a nih."
17,"Ye therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked, ye fall from your own stedfastness.","Chuongchun, dittakhai, nang- nîn chuong thu chu in lo hriet lâwk leiin fîmkhur ro, chuong naw chun, mi suolhai indik nawnaa ṭhuoi hmanga umin, in det ṭhat lai tlu rawi in tih."
18,But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and for ever. Amen.,"Amiruokchu, ei Lalpa le San- damtu Isu Krista lunginsietna le hrietnaa chun inṭhang lien ro. Tuta le chatuon chenin ama kuoma chun ropuina um raw se. Amen."
