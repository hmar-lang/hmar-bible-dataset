verse_no,en,hmr
1,"But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.","Nisienlakhawm, mihai lai chun zâwlnei tehlêmhai khawm an hung suok kha, chuong ang bawkin nangni lai khawm inchûktirtu tehlêmhai la hung um an tih, anni chun anni inchawtu Lalpa meu chu inphatsanin, mi sukse thei ringna tumhai inrûkin la hung lûtpui an ta, mâni chungah kârloa bohmangna intlungtir an tih."
2,And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.,"Chun, mi tamtakin an hurna tieng thilhai chu chîng vêng an ta, anni leiin lampui indik tak chu hrilsiet ning a tih."
3,"And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not.","Chun, sum inhnar leiin thu khêlin sumdâwngna dingin hmang an ti cheu a; nisienlakhawm, inhmaa an thiemnaw changna chu a nêp chuong nawh a, an bohmangna hlak a ininnghil bawk nawh."
4,"For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;","Vântirkohaiin thil an suksuol lai khan Pathienin a hla nawh a, hremhmunah a pei a, rorêlpêk dinga khêk dingin khur inthimah a khum lem sih a."
5,"and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;","Chun, ama ngaisaknawhai um- na, khawvêla khan tui suklêtin, tien- lai khawvêl chu a hla nawh a, nisienlakhawm, Noa, felna thu hril- tu, mi dang pasari leh a sandam tah a."
6,"and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly;","Sodom le Gomorra khuohai chu ama ngaisak naw la hung um dinghai inentirna dingin a hmang a, vuta inchangtirin, sukbohmangin thiem- naw ân changtir tah a."
7,"and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked","Lota mi fel, mi suolhai umdân hurtak leia lungngai bêk bêk chu a sandam tah a;"
8,"(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds):","(chu mi fel chu anni laia a umin a mitin a hmuh a, a nain a hriet a, dân naw anga an thilthawhai chun a lungril fel chu ni tin an sukna bêk bêk hlak sih a.)"
9,"the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment;","Lalpa chun, ama ngaisaktuhai chu thlêmnaa inthawka sansuok dân le, fel nawhai chu rorêl nia dingin hrem puma khêk dân a hriet;"
10,"but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities:","châkna inthieng naw kawnga tisa anga um le, rorêlpêkna hmusit- tuhai lem lem chu rorêl nia dingin hrem puma khêk dân a hriet nâwk zuol a nih. Invêthuoi le kâwmaw an na, ropuinahai an hrilsiet khawmin an inthin ngai nawh."
11,"whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord.","Vântirko, hrâtna le thilthaw- theina nei lemhai hmanin, Lalpa hmaa chu an chungthu rêlpêkin an hrilsiet ngai naw kha."
12,"But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,","Nisienlakhawm, hieng thil- hring, ngaituona nei naw, mana sukbohmang dinga sa chaua pienghai ang hin, thil an hriet nawhai chu hrilsein; anni sietnain se ngei an tih."
13,"suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; men that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their deceivings while they feast with you;","Thil suksuol manin thilsuol tuor an tih. Sûna ruoiṭhe buoi in- hawiti mi an nih. In kuoma ruoi an ṭhein, anni inhlêmna ruoi ṭhe an ni leiin, inthieng nawna kaihai le thil khawhlohai an na;"
14,"having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing;","mit uirea sip, suol bân thei naw- hai an nei a; mi det nawhai an thlêm thlûk a; inhnar hmang lungril an put a; ṭawngsephur nauhai an nih."
15,"forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing;","Bosar naupa Balaam, thil suk- suol hlaw ngainatu lampui chu an hraw leiin lampui indik chu an mâksan a, an invâk hmang tah a."
16,but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake with man’s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet.,"Nisienlakhawm, ama chu a bawsietna leiin kâwkin a um tah a; Sabengtung ṭawng thei naw chu mihriem ṭawngin a hung ṭawng a, zâwlnei invêtna chu a khap a nih."
17,"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.","Chuong chu tuikhur tui um naw le, sûm thlipui imût lêng chu an nih, chuonghai ta ding chun inthim sa khup chu khêk a ni tah."
18,"For, uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error;","Thu teplo uortak taka hrilin, suola umhai laia inthawka tlân suok zinghai chu tisa châknaa hurnain an thlêm thlûk hlak sih a."
19,"promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.",Anni chu sietna suok ni pum zingin mihai chu zalênna thu an tiem hlak a; mi chu ama hnetu taphawt suokah a um hlak sih a.
20,"For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.","Lalpa le Sandamtu Isu Krista an hriet leia khawvêl inthieng nawnahai an tlân suok san hnungin chutaka bawk chun an intâng nâwk a, ngama an um nâwk si chun, an umze nuhnung chu a tîra nêk chun a hung se ta lem nîng a tih."
21,"For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.","Lampui fel chu hriet hnunga, thupêk inthieng an kuoma inkawltira um chu nghatsan nêk chun, lampui fel hre naw hai sienla, an ta dingin a ṭha lem ding bah."
22,"It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.","“Ui ama luok tieng a kîr nâwk a, vawkpui insilfai ta khawm chirhakah insil dingin a kîr nâwk a,” ti thuvartawi indiktak ang thu chu an chungah a hung um ta a nih."
