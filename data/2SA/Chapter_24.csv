1,"And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.","Chun, LALPA lunginsenna chu Israelhai chungah a ṭuong nawk ta thut a, “Fe la, Israel mihai le Juda mihai tiem vawng rawh,” tiin David chun an pawi tâwk dingin a chawktho a."
2,"And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.","Chun, lal chun a kuoma um sipai hotu Joab kuoma chun, “Israel hnam po po lai hin Dana inthawka Beer- Seba chenin invâk vêl la mi ieng zât am an ni ka hriet theina dingin tiem vawng ro,” a ta."
3,"And Joab said unto the king, Now Jehovah thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?","Chun, Joab chun lal kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien chun mipuihai sukpungin, ieng zâta tam khawm, a lêt za khawm, lalpa ka pu a hin hmu hman raw se; nisienlakhawm, lalpa ka pu chun chu chu iengdinga hriet ân hâwk am a ni leh?” a ta."
4,"Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, lal thu chun Joab le a sipai hotuhai chu a hne tah a. Chuongchun, Joab le a sipai hotu- hai chu Israelhai tiem ding chun lal kuoma inthawk chu an suok tah a."
5,"And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer:","Chun, Jordan râl an va kai a, chun, Gad ruom laitak changtieng panga khaw um Aroera chun Jazer chenin umhmun an khuor a;"
6,"then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,","chun, Tahtim-hodsi le Gilead ram an tlung a; chun, Dan-jaan an tlung a, Zidon panin an fe pei a,"
7,"and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba.","chun, Tura kul dâm an va tlung a; chun, Hiv mihai le Kanaan mihai khuohai po po an tlung a, chun, Judai simtieng Beer-sebaah an feh a."
8,"So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.","Chuongchun, ram po po chu an fang suok hnung chun, thla kuo le ni sâwmhni zoah Jerusalemah an fe nâwk tah a."
9,And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.,"Chun, Joab chun mihriem zât chin chu lal a pêk a; chun, Israel rama chun kâwlhnâm chawi mi, mi huoisen nuoi riet an um a; chun, Juda mi chu nuoi nga an um a."
10,"And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.","Chun, mihriem an hang tiem zo chun David lungril chu a na ta hle el a. David chun LALPA kuomah, “Ka thilthawa hin nasatakin ka lo suol tah a nih; nisienlakhawm, tuhin aw LALPA, i siehlaw rîtlona hi sie hmang dingin ka ngên che, invêttakin ka lo thaw tah a nih,” a ta."
11,"And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,","Chun, zîngkâra David a hang tho chun David zâwlnei, zâwlnei Gad kuomah LALPA thu a hung tlung a,"
12,"Go and speak unto David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.","“Fe la, David kuomah, ‘LALPA- IN hieng ang hin a tih; thil kawng thum ka ruotpêk cheh a, i chunga ka thaw dingin pakhat thlang rawh,’ a tih a,” tiin."
13,"So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.","Chuongchun, Gad chu David kuomah a feh a, a kuomah, “I rama hin kum sari ṭâm hung tlâk am, i hmêlma hmaa an hnawt sûng cheh a, thla thum lo tlân hmang hri am, i rama ni thum hri hung inlêng? a mi tirtu ieng angin am ka dawn ding a na, inngaituo la, mi hril raw khai,” a ta."
14,"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.","Chun, David chun Gad kuom- ah, “Ka lunginzîng hle el a, LALPA kutah tlulût phawt el lang; a zângaina chu a nasa hle sih a; mihriem kuta chen chu mîn tlûklûttir naw hram rawh,” a ta."
15,So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.,"Chuongchun, LALPA chun Israel mihai lai chun zîngkâra in- thawkin hun ruot ang chen chu hri ân lêngtir a, chuongchun, mipuihai laia mi chu Dana inthawka Beer-Seba chenah mi sîng sari an thih a."
16,"And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.","Chun, vântirkoin sukse dinga Jerusalem tienga a kut a hang inlet chun LALPAIN thil ṭha naw thaw a tum chu ân lêt a, mihai sukbo- hmangtu vântirko kuoma chun, “A hun tah ie, i kut inlet ta naw rawh,” a ta. Chun, LALPA vântirko chu Jebus mi Arauna hrizâwl bula chun a um a."
17,"And David spake unto Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.","Chun, Davidin mi sukhlumtu vântirko a hmu chun LALPA a biek a, “Ngai ta, ka lo suol tah a, indik nawtakin thil ka lo thaw tah a nih; nisienlakhawm, hieng berâmhai hin ieng thil am an thawh a? I kut chun keima le ka pa sûnghai mi tâwk lem raw se aw,” a ta."
18,"And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.","Chun, chu ni chun Gad chu David kuomah a feh a, a kuomah, “Hang fe la, Jebus mi Arauna hrizâwlah LALPA ta dingin mâichâm hang siem rawh,” a ta."
19,"And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.","Chun, David chu LALPAIN thu a pêk anga, Gadin a hril ang chun a hang fe tah a."
20,"And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.","Chun, Arauna chu a hei ngha a, ama tieng pana lal le a rawihai hung chu a hmuh a, chuongchun, Arauna chu a suok a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin lal hmaa chun a bawkkhup a."
21,"And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people.","Chun, Arauna chun, “Iengdinga ka pu lal chu a siehlaw kuoma hi hung am a nih a?” a ta. Chun, David chun, “Mipuihai laia inthawka hri hi ân kieng theina dingin LALPA ta dinga mâichâm siemna dinga i hrizâwl hi inchaw dingin,” a ta."
22,"And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:","Chun, Arauna chun David kuomah, “Lalpa ka pu chun âwm a ti chu la sienla, inhlân raw se, en ta, pumrawhmanga inhlân dingin bâwngchalhai chu an um a; chun, thing dingin hrizâwl hmangruohai le sebâwng thuomhnawhai chu a um bawk a."
23,"all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.","Aw, lalpa, hieng po po hi Arauna chun lal a pêk vawng a nih,” a ta. Chun, Arauna chun lal kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien chun hung dawn raw se che,” a ta."
24,"And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price; neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.","Chun, lal chun Arauna kuomah, “Ni lo e, a man neiin ân châwk ngeiin inchawpêk lem ka ti che, iengkhawm insêng loin LALPA ka Pathien kuom- ah pumrawhmang thilinhlân inhlân naw tawp ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chun hrizâwl le sebâwngchal- hai chu tangka shekel sâwmngain ân châwk tah a."
25,"And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.","Chun, David chun chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a, pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai le inremna thilinhlânhai ân hlân a. Chuongchun, LALPA chu an ram chunga chun a lungâwi a, Israel rama inthawkin hri chu ân kieng tah a.24.24 1 Chr 21.34 24.25 Is 19.22"
