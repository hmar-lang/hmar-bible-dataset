1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.",Chuong thil hnunga chun Absalom chun tawlailîr le sakawrhai le mi sâwmnga a hmaa tlân dingin a buotsai a.
2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.","Chun, Absalom chu zîngkâr hin a tho a, kul kawtkhâr lampuia chun a lo ngîr hlak a; chun, lal kuoma thupawi hung hril ding taphawt chu Absalom chun a lo ko hlak a, “Khâwlai khuo am in nih a?” a lo ti pei hlak a. Chun, “I siehlaw hi Israel hnam laia hnam pakhat ka nih,” an ti pei hlak a."
3,"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.","Chun, Absalom chun, “I aw, i thu chu a ṭhain ân dik a, nisienlakhawm, ngaituotu dingin lalin tukhawm a ruot nawh,” a lo ti hlak a."
4,"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!","Chun, Absalom ma chun, “Mi tin thupawi hril ding nei amanih, hni ding nei amani taphawt chu ka kuoma an hung theina dingin; kei hi hi ram rorêltua hin mi siem sien ka va ti deh aw! chuongchun, feltakin ka rêlpêk hlak ding bah,” dâm a lo ti bawk hlak a."
5,"And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.","Hieng ang khawm hin a thawh a, tukhawm ama chibai bûk dinga hang hnai taphawthai chu a lo ban a, a chel a, a lo fâwp hlak a."
6,And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.,"Chuongchun, Israel mi lal kuoma thuhril dinga hung taphawthai chu Absalom chun chuong ang chun a lo thaw pei hlak a. Chuongchun, Absalom chun Israel mihai lungril chu a hlîppêk a."
7,"And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.","Chun, kum li a hung invawi hnung chun, Absalom chun lal kuoma chun, “Ka hni che a nih, Hebron khuoah LALPA kuoma ka thutiem hlen dingin mîn fetir raw khai."
8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.","I siehlaw hin Suria rama Gesura ka um lai khan, ‘LALPAIN Jerusa- lema a mi ṭhuoi nâwk phawt chun LALPA rawng bâwl ka tih,’ tiin thu ka lo tiem tah a nih,” a ta."
9,"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Lung- muongtakin fe raw khai,” a ta. Chuongchun, a tho a, Hebrona chun a fe tah a."
10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.","Nisienlakhawm, Absalom chun, “Tawtawrâwt ri in hriet phingleh, ‘Absalom chu Hebronah lal a nih,’ ti ro,” tiin Israel hnam po pohai lai mi a tir rûk ta hlau a."
11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.","Chun, Absalom kuoma chun, a mi fielhai, mi za hni Jerusalema inthawkin an fe veh a, lungril ṭhatak putin an feh a, iengkhawm an hriet ve nawh."
12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.","Chun, Absalom chun inthâwi- nahai chu ân hlân laiin, Gilon mi Ahithophel, David rorêlpui chu, a khuo Gilo a inthawkin ân chah a, an thu phierrûuk chu a nasa hle el a. Absalom tieng chun mipui chu an pung tul tul el sih a."
13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.","Chun, David kuoma chun, “Israel mihai lungril chu Absalom tieng a thle hle el,” tiin mitir a hung a."
14,"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.","Chun, David chun Jerusalema a mihai po po kuoma chun, “Tho unla, tlân suok ei tiu, tukhawm Absaloma inthawk hin ei suok thei âwm si nawh a, suok vak ro khai, chuong naw chun mi hung hnawt phâk vak el a tih; ei chunga hin thil ṭha nawtak hung intlun a ta, kâwlhnâmin khuo hi hung thaw rawi a tih,” a ta."
15,"And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.","Chun, lal mihai chun lal kuomah, “Ngai ta, i siehlawhai hi lal kan lalin a ruot ang peia thaw dingin kan inzo zing a nih,” an ta."
16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.","Chun, lal chu a suok a, a sûnghai po po chun an zui a. Chun, lal chun in nghâk dingin nuhmei sâwm thaikêm ruol chu a sieh a."
17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.","Chun, lal chu a suok a, mipui po pohai chun an zui a, chun, in tâwpna taka chun an châwl hrih a."
18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.","Chun, a mi po pohai chun an fe khêl a, chun, Kerith mi po pohai, Peleth mi po pohai le Git mi za ruk Gath-a inthawka ama hung zuituhai chun lal chu an pêl pei a."
19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; return to thine own place.","Chuongchun, lal chun Git mi Ittai kuoma chun, “Iengtiziea nang hi i hung ve am? Kîr nâwk la, lal kuomah um rawh, nang chu mikhuol ram danga mi i ni bawk sih a, nangma hmun tieng kîr nâwk raw khai."
20,"Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.","Zâni ela hung i na, vawisûn hin a suk a tunga mi zui dingin ka ti ve ding che am a nih? Ka fe theina naah ka fe ding a na, nang chu kîr nâwk la, i unauhai po po hi ṭhuoi kîr rawh, lunginsietna le thutak i kuomah um raw se,” a ta."
21,"And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.","Chun, Ittai chun lal chu a dawn a, “LALPA hringna le lal, ka pu hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, lal ka pu hi i umna taphawta chun thi le thi nîng a ta, dam le dam ning a ta, i siehlaw hi um ve pei a tih,” a ta."
22,"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.","Chun, David chun, Ittai kuoma chun, “Fe unla, fe pei ro le,” a ta. Chuongchun, Git mi Itai chu a mihai po po le an nauhai po po le chun an feh a."
23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.","Chun, inringtakin a ram phêkin an ṭap tah a, mipui chu an fe vawng a; thlalêr lampui tieng chu panin lal khawm chun Kidron vadung chu a kân a; chun, mipui po po chun an kân bawk a."
24,"And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.","Chun, Zadok hai, Pathien thu- thlungna bâwm zâwnin Levi mihai po po leh a kuomah an fe veh a; Pathien bâwm chu an innghat a, mipuiin khuo chu an suoksan kim vawng chenin Abiathar chu a hang feh a."
25,"And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:","Chun, lal chun Zadok kuomah, “Pathien bâwm kha khawpui sûngah zâwn kîr nâwk ro, LALPA mittlunga ka um chun mi ṭhuoi kîr nâwk a ta; Pathien bâwm le a umna chu mîn hmutir nâwk a ta;"
26,"but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.","amiruokchu, ‘Nangmaah lâwm- na hrim ka nei nawh,’ a ti chun, ngai ta, hieng el hi ka na, ṭha a ti ang angin ka chunga hin thaw el raw se,” a ta."
27,"The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou not a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.","Lal chun thiempu Zadok kuoma chun, “Hmu theitu i ni naw am a nih? I naupasalhai pahni i naupa Ahimaaz le Abiathar naupa Jonathan leh lungmuongtakin khawpuiah fe nâwk ro."
28,"See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.","Ngai ta, kei chu chanchin in mi hung inhriettir hmakhat chu thlalêra vadung kaiahai hin lo um ka tih,” a ta."
29,Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.,"Chuongchun, Zadok le Abiathar chun Pathien bâwm chu Jerusalema chun an fepui nâwk a; chun, chutaka chun an um tah a."
30,"And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.","Chuongchun, David chu Oliv tlâng hang fenaa chun a hang feh a, fe malam chun a ṭap malam pei a, a lu a khum a, ke ruokin a feh a; chun, a kuoma mi po pohai chun an lu an khum seng a, ṭap pum peiin an hang feh a."
31,"And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.","Chun, tuin amanih David chu, “Ahithophel chu Absalom tienga ṭhangin thu phiertuhai lai a ṭhang ve,” tiin a hril a. Chun, David chun, “Aw LALPA, Ahithophel remruot chu invêtnaa inchangtir dingin ka ngên che,” a ta."
32,"And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top of the ascent, where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.","Chun, David chu Pathien biekna tlâng sîp a hang lâwn kai chun, ngai ta, Ark mi Husai chu a zakaw keithlêr hâka, a lua pilvut kâi luomin ama tuok dingin a hung a."
33,"And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “Ka kuoma i fe ve chun keia ta dinga phurrik i ni el ding a na."
34,"but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.","Amiruokchu, khawpui tieng chun i kîr a, Absalom kuomah, ‘Aw lalpa, i siehlawah um ka tih, kha hma tienga i pa siehlawa ka um ang khan tuhin i siehlawah um thung tâng ka tih,’ i va ti chun Ahithophel remruot mi hluopêktu ni lem i tih."
35,"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.","Chutaka chun thiempu Zadok le Abiathar khawm an um ve a ni naw am a nih? Chuongchun, hieng hi hung nîng a ta, lal ina thu suok i hriet taphawt chu thiempu Zadok le Abiathar hril hlak i ta."
36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear.","Ngai ta, an naupasalhai pahni Zadok naupa Ahimaaz le Abiathar naupa Jonathan khawm an kuomah an um kha; chun, i thil hriet taphawt chu mi hril dingin anni chu i hung tir hlak ding annâwm,” a ta."
37,"So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, David ruolpa Husai chu khawpuia chun a lût a; chun, Absalom chu Jerusalema chun a lût tah a."
