6,"And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.","Bu la ni âwmtakin insûng ril tieng chun an lût a, a phîngah an va sun a; chun, Rekab le a unaupa Baana chu an tlânhmang tah a."
7,"Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.","Chun, inah an va lût a, a zâlna pindana khuma zâl chu an sun a, an that a, a lu an tan a, a lu chu an lâk a, Araba lampui tieng fe thlengin zânkhawvârin an feh a."

9,"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,","Chun, David chun Beeroth mi Rimmon naupa Rekab le a unaupa chu a dawn a, an kuomah, “LALPA ka lunginzîngna po poa mi sandamtu hringna sâlin ka hril a nih;"
10,"when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings.","chanchin ṭha hung tluna inngaiin ‘Ngai ta, Saula chu a thi tah,’ tiin mi pakhatin a mi hung hril a, ama chu ka man a, Ziklaga chun ka that a; chu chu a chanchin ṭha hung intlun mana ka lo pêk chu a nih."
11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?","Mi fel ama insûng luma, a khumlaizâwl ngeia mi, mi suolin an that a thisen man chu nangnia in- thawk hin ka phût nâwk zuolin, hnuoia inthawk hin ka va sukbo- hmang âwm ngei cheu deh aw,” a ta."
12,"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron.
