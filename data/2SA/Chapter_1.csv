1,"And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;","Chun, Saula a thi hnungin, David chu Amalek mihai rûnnaa inthawkin a hung a, David chu Ziklag khuoa ni hni a um hnung chun,"
2,"it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.","a ni thum ni chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat an ṭhanghmuna inthawk Saula kuoma mi chu a puonhai tlêr nengnungin le a lua pilvut kai nung hin a hung a; chun, David kuomah a hung tlung chun hnuoia bawkkhupin chibai a bûk a."
3,"And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.","David chun a kuomah, “Khaw laia inthawka hung am i nih a?” a ta; ama chun, “Israel mihai ṭhanghmuna inthawkin ka hung tlân suok a nih,” a ta."
4,"And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “Ieng angin am thil a um a, mi hril ta khai?” a ta. Ama chun a dawn a, “Indonaa inthawk chun mihai chu an tlânseh a, mi tamtak chu an tluh a, an thi tâwl a, chun, Saula le a naupa Jonathan khawm an thi ve a,” a ta."
5,"And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?","Chun, David chun a hriltu tlangvâl kuoma chun, “Iengtin am Saula le a naupa Jonathan chu an thi ti i hriet a?” a ta."
6,"And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.","A hriltu tlangvâl chun, “Iengtin tin amanih Gilboa tlânga chun ka lo um kher a; chun, ngai ta, Saula chu a fei ringsana ngîr ka hmuh a, chun, tawlailîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai chun an hung hnai ta hle el a."
7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.","Chun, a hnungtieng a hung ngha chun a mi hei hmuh a, a mi hei ko a. Chun, kei chun, ‘Hitaka hin ka um ie,’ tiin ka dawn a."
8,"And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.","Chuongchun, ka kuomah, ‘Tu am i nih a?’ tiin a mîn dawn a. Chun, kei chun, ‘Amalek mi ka nih,’ tiin ka dawn a."
9,"And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, ‘Ka kâwla hin ngîr la, mi hung that el ta, ka la dam ting a, lunginzîngnain a mi tlâkkhum ta sih a,’ a ta."
10,"So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.","Chuongchun, a kâwla chun ka ngîr a, chuonga tlu dêr ta hnung chu a dam zo ta âwm hrim hrima ka hriet naw leiin ka that ta el a, a lua lallukhum le bânbun chu ka lâk a, ka pu kuomah hitaka hin ka hung lâk a nih,” a ta."
11,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:","Chuongchun, David chun ama silfênhai chu a chel a, a keithlêr tah a, chuong ang bawk chun a kuoma mi um po pohai chun an thaw veh a;"
12,"and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.","chuongchu, Saula le a naupa Jonathan le LALPA mihai le Israel sûnghai chun an sûn a, an ṭah a, zântieng chenin bu an nghei a, kâwlhnâma sukhlum an ni tâk leiin."
13,"And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.","Chun, David chun a hriltu tlangvâl kuoma chun, “Khâwtieng mi am i nih a?” a ta. Ama chun, “Hmêl- mak mi, Amalek mi naupa ka nih,” a tih a, a dawn a."
14,"And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah’s anointed?","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “LALPA hrieknâl sukbohmang dinga a chunga kutthlâk chu iengtiziea ṭi lo am i nih a?” a ta."
15,"And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.","Chuongchun, David chun tlang- vâlhai laia mi pakhat chu a ko a, “Va hnai la, va that rawh,” a ta. Chun, a va sât a, a thi tah a."
16,"And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah’s anointed.","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “I thisen chu nangma lu chung ngeiah um raw se, nangma bâu ngeiin, ‘LALPA hrieknâl chu ka that a nih,’ tiin a phuong si cheh a,” a ta."
17,And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,"Chuongchun, David chun Saula le a naupa Jonathan chu hi ṭaphla hin a ṭah a,"
18,"(and he bade them teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):","chun, thal hla chu Juda thlahai inchûktir dingin a tir tâwl a, ngai ta, Jaser bua chun ziek a nih."
19,"Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!","Aw Israel, i ropuina chu i bâwlhmunahai that a na, Mi thilthawtheihai an tlu ta hi!"
20,"Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.","Gath-a chun hril naw unla, Askelon kawtthlêrahai chun phuong bawk naw ro; Chuong naw chun Philistin naunuhai lâwm an ta, Sertan lo naunuhai hlimin khêk pal rawi an tih."
21,"Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.","Nangni Gilboa tlânghai, In chungah dâidâw le ruo khawm tla naw raw se; thil inhlân ding khawm insuo bawk naw ro. Chutaka chun mi thilthawthei phaw chu tirdakumtakin an pei sih a; Saula phaw, hrieknâl lo mi phaw ang elin."
22,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.","Thathai thisena inthawk le, mi thilthawthei thâua inthawk chun, Jonathan thal chu a lêt nawh a; Saula kâwlhnâm chu a thlâwnin a lêt bawk nawh."
23,"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.","Saula le Jonathan umdân chu dit a umin a mâwi a, An thi khawma an inṭhe nawh; Mupuihai nêkin an ṭuonrang lem a, Sakeibakneihai nêkin an hrât lem."
24,"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.","Nangni Israel naunuhai, Saula chu ṭa ro, Puon sen mawihaia inthuom cheu a, In puonahai rângkachaka cheimawinahai belpêktu cheu chu."
25,How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.,Indo lai taka mi thilthawtheihai an tlûk el chu! I bâwlhmunahai Jonathan chu an that tah.
26,"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.","Ka unaupa Jonathan, i chungthua hin ka lunginzîng a nih; Ka chungah i ṭha êm êm hlak a, I mi hmangaina chu a mak a, Nuhmei hmangaina chu a khûm dai a nih."
27,"How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!","Mi thilthawtheihai chu an tluh a, Indona thuomhnawhai khawm a bohmang zo tah!"
