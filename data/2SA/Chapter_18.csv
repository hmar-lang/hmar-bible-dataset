1,"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.","Chun, David chun a kuoma mi umhai chu a tiem a, sipai sâng chunga hotu dâm, za chunga hotu dâm a siem a."
2,"And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.","Chun, David chun mihai chu a tirsuok a, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu Joab chun ân rawi a, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu Joab unaupa Zeruia naupa, Abisaiin ân rawi a, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu Git mi Ittai chun ân rawi a. Chun, lal chun mipuihai kuomah, “Keima ngei khawm in kuomah fe ve ngei ngei ka tih,” a ta."
3,"But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city.","Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chun, “Fe ve lo e, keini rawi hi chu tlân hmang ta ang ni inla khawm, pawi ti naw ni hai a; chun, a chenve lai rau khawm hi va thi inla khawm an ûksak bar âwm nawh a, nang chu keinirawi sîng tlukin i hlu sih a, chuleiin, khawpuia inthawka mi ṭhangpui dinga inzosa zinga i lo um chu a ṭha lem a nih,” an ta."
4,"And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.","Chun, lal chun an kuomah, “Ṭha in ti ang pei chun thâwng ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, lal chu kul kawtkhâr bula chun a ngîr a; chun, mipui po po chu za têl têl le sâng têl têl chun an suok ta zut zut el a."
5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.","Chun, lal chun Joab le Abisai le Ittai chu, “Keima leiin tlangvâl Absalom chu indawitakin va thaw ro khai,” tiin thu a pêk a. Mipui po poin Absalom chungchâng thuah lalin sipai hotuhai po po thu a pêk lai chu an hriet a."
6,So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.,"Chuongchun, mipuihai chu Israel mihai chu do dingin indona hmun tieng chun an fe tah a; chun, an indona chu Ephraim rampui hnuoiah a nih."
7,"And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.","Chun, chutaka chun David mihai hmaa chun Israel mihai chu an tlâwm tah a; chun, chutaka chun chu ni chun mi sîng hni zet an that a."
8,For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.,"An indona chun chuong lai ram po po chu a huop vawng el sih a, chu ni chun kâwlhnâm nêk hmanin rampui chun a lem tam lem a nih."
9,"And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.","Chun, Absalom chun David mihai chu a vân tuokpui ta thut a. Chun, Absalom chu a sabengtung lien chi chungah a chuong a; chun, sa- bengtung chu thingsaisuo kau inbuktak hnuoiah a lût a, a lu chu thingsaisuoa chun ân tâng tah a, hnuoi tâwk lo, vân tâwk lo chun ân khai ta zing el a; chun, sabengtung hlak chu a fe pei tah a."
10,"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.","Chun, tuin amani hin a hmuh a, Joab a hril a, “Ngai ta, thingsaisuoah Absalom inkhai zingin ka hmu,” a ta."
11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.","Chun, Joab chun a hriltu kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, chu chu i hmu sih a, iengdinga i sukhluma hnuoia i suk- thlâk nghâl naw? chuong chun thaw la chu tangka sâwm le kâwngkhi ka pêk ding che bah,” a ta."
12,"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.","Chun, mi chun Joab kuomah, “Tangka sâng khawm hmu ding ni lang lal naupa chungah ka kut thlâk naw hrim hrim ka tih; kan na hriet ngeiah lalin nang le Abisai le Ittai kuomah, ‘Tlangvâl Absalom chu tukhawma tâwk naw raw se,’ tiin thu a pêk si cheu a."
13,"Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.","Ringumlotakin lo that ta ringawt inla, (lal kuoma chun ieng- khawm thup thei a ni âwm si nawh a) nang chu în sukfihlîm nâwk el âwm sih a,” a ta."
14,"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.","Chuongchun, Joab chun, “Hieng hin chu i kuomah ka um zing thei naw tawp el a,” a ta, fei pathum a chawi a, thingsaisuo laia Absalom dama lo la umzing lungkhura chun a sun a."
15,"And ten young men that bare Joab’s armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.","Chun, Joab râlthuom chawitu tlangvâl sâwm chun an hung inhuol a, Absalom chu an sun a, an that tah a."
16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.","Chun, Joab chun tawtawrâwt a hei mût a, Israel hnawttu mipuihai chu an hung kîr tah a, Joab chun mipuihai chu a lo dang tlat el tah a."
17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.","Chun, Absalom ruong chu an lâk a, rampui hnuoia khursûng in- thûktaka chun an peilût a, a chunga chun nasatakin lung an dêng khâwm a, chun, Israel mihai po po chu mâni puon in sengah an tlân tah a."
18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom’s monument, unto this day.","Absalom chun a dam laiin lal ruoma chun lung intieng a lo intieng diem tah a, “Ka hming a dei nawna dingin, naupasal khawm ka nei si nawh a,” a ta. Chu lung intieng hminga chun ama hming ân puttir a, tu chen hin Absalom hriet zingna ti a nih."
19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that Jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies.","Chuongchun, Zadok naupa Ahimaaz chun, “Va tlân ka ta, LALPAIN a hmêlma phuba a lâkpêk dân chanchin hi lal chu va hril ka tih,” a ta."
20,"And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.","Chun, Joab chun a kuomah, “Vawisûn chu chanchin chu va hril naw rawh, ni dangah chanchin chu la hril lem rawh, lal naupa chu a thi ta leiin, vawisûn chu chanchin ieng- khawm va hril naw rawh,” a ta."
21,"Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.","Chuongchun, Joab chun Kus mi kuoma chun, “Fe la, i thil hmu chu lal va hril raw le,” a ta. Chun, Kus mi chun kûnin Joab chu chibai a bûk a, a tlân tah a."
22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?","Chuongchun, Zadok naupa Ahimaaz chun Joab kuomah, “Ieng- khawm ni sienla, Kus mi kha va hnawtzui ka tih,” a ti nâwk a. Chun, Joab chun, “Ka naupa, chanchin hril man chu i hmu âwm si nawh a, iengdingin am tlân i ta?” a ta."
23,"But come what may, said he, I will run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “Iengkhawm ni sien tlân ka tih,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Tlân el raw le,” a ta. Chuongchun, Ahimaaz chu phaizâwl tieng lampuiah a tlân a, Kus mi chu a lekhêl a."
24,"Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.","Chuongchun, David chu dai- kawtkhâr pahni inkâra chun a lo ṭhung a; chun râl vêngtu chu kul kawtkhâr tuolpuo lem chung tieng chun a hang lâwn a, a hang ngha vêl a, mi pakhat a khât baka hung tlân a hmu a."
25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.","Chun, râl vêngtu chu a khêk a, lal chu a hril a. Chun, lal chun “Mi pakhat bak a ni chun chanchin hung hril ding ni ngei a tih,” a ta."
26,"And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold, another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.","Chun, a hung vat vat a, a hung hnai ta deu deu a. Chun, râl vêngtu chun mi dang hung tlân a hmu nâwk a; chun, râl vêngtu chun kawtkhâr vêngtu chu a ko a, “En ta, mi dang ama khât bakin a hung tlân nâwk,” a ta. Chun, lal chun, “Ama khawm chun chanchin a hung intlun ve ding a ni chu,” a ta."
27,"And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.","Chun, râl vêngtu chun, “A hmasa lem tlân dân chu Zadok naupa Ahimaaz tlân dân ni âwm- takin ka hriet,” a ta. Chun, lal chun, “Ama chu mi ṭhatak a na, chanchin ṭhatak a hung intlun ding nîng a tih,” a ta."
28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.","Chun, Ahimaaz chun a ko a, lal kuomah, “A ṭha vawng ie,” a ta. Chun, a hmaia hnuoi sikin lal hmaa chun chibai bûkin a kûn a, “Lalpa, ka lalpa thaw tuma kut thlâk tumtuhai lo dangtu LALPA i Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se,” a ta."
29,"And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.","Chun, lal chun, “Tlangvâl Absa- lom kha a la dam de maw?” a ta. Chun, Ahimaaz chun a dawn a, “Joabin lal siehlaw, kei i siehlaw ngei hi a mi tirsuok laiin an buoi mur mur ka hmuh a; nisienlakhawm, ieng ang char a ni chu ka hriet nawh,” a ta."
30,"And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.","Chun, lal chun, “Ka sîra hin la hung ngîr hri ta,” a ta. Chun, a sîra chun a hung ngîr a."
31,"And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king; for Jehovah hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.","Chun, ngai ta, Kus mi chu a hung tlung a; chun, Kus mi chun, “Lalpa, ka lalpa ta dingin chan- chin ka hung intlun a nih, i chunga helhai po po phuba chu LALPAIN vawisûn hin a lâkpêk ta che a nih,” a ta."
32,"And the king said unto the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.","Chun, lal chun Kus mi kuoma chun, “Tlangvâl Absalom chu a la dam de maw?” a ta. Chun, Kus mi chun a dawn a, “Lalpa ka lalpa hmêlmahai le i sietna zawngtuhai po po chu chu tlangvâl ang chun um vawng raw hai se,” a ta."
33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!","Chuongchun, lal chu a lungin- zîng ta hle el a, kul kawtkhâr chunga pindana chun a hang feh a, a ṭap a; chun, a hang fe malam chun, “Aw, ka naupa Absalom, ka naupa, ka naupa Absalom, i aia chun kei hi hang thi lem lang aw, Aw Absalom, ka naupa, ka naupa!” a ta."
