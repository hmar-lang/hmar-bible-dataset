1,"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:","Chu naw khawm chu Absalom kuomah Ahithophel chun, “Tuhin mi sîng khat le sâng hni thlang suok ka ta, chun, vawizân hin David chu hnawt dingin inthawk ka tih;"
2,"and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;","a châu lai le a hrâtnaw laitak va nangchîng ka ta, va sukṭîng ka tih, chuongchun, a kuoma mi um po pohai chu tlân hmang an ta; chuongchun, lal chau chu va that el ka tih;"
3,and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.,"chun, mipuihai chu i kuomah hung ṭhuoi kîr vawng ka ta, i mi zawng chu mi po po hung kîr tluk a nih; chuongchun, mi po po inremin um tâng an tih,” a ta."
4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.","Chuongchun, chu thu chun Absalom le Israel upahai po po chu a suklâwm ta hleh a."
5,"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.","Chun, Absalom chun, “Tu hin Ark mi Husai chu ko ve phawt unla, a hril ve dân lo ngai phawt ei tih,” a ta."
6,"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.","chun, Husaiin Absalom kuom a hung tlung chun, Absalom chun, “Ahithophel chun hieng ang hin a hril a, a hril ang hin kan thaw ding am a nih? Thaw naw ding ni ta ang inla, nangin hang hril ve ta khai,” a ta."
7,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.","Chun, Husai chun Absalom kuomah, “Tuta ṭuma Ahithophel remruot hi a ṭha naw a nih,” a ta."
8,"Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.","Chun, Husai chun, “I pa le a mihai chu i hriet a, sipai huoitak, mi kâwlhrâwngtak, phûla savawm a tê manpêk ang el an na; chun, i pa hi indo mi a na, mipui lai chun riek khawm riek kher naw ni."
9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.","Ngai ta, tu khawm hin khaw lai khursûnga manih, khawlai hmuna manih ân bi zing a ni ding a na; chun, an inthaw tîra mi ṭhenkhat an tlu nuol chun a hre taphawtin, ‘Absalom zuituhai chu an that ṭeu el ie,’ ti el an ta."
10,"And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.","Chuongchun, mi huoisentak, sakeibaknei lungril ang put mi meu khawm lo ṭîng a ta, Israel mi po po hlak chun i pa chu sipai huoitak a ni le a kuoma mi umhai chu mi huoisen- tak tak an ni ti an hriet vawng sih a."
11,"But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.","Keia remruot ve dân chu, Israel mi po po chu Dana inthawkin Beer- seba tlung rakin an tamzie tuisuo- rieta phaiphin zât zetin i kuomah ko khâwm la; chun, indonaa khawm chun nang meu khawm fe ve la."
12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.","Chuongchun, khâwlai hmuna khawm ei tuok fûkna taphawtah hnuoia dâidâw tla ang elin bâwng ei ta, chun, ama le a kuoma mi umhai po po chu pakhat khawm hla nâwng ei tih."
13,"Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.","Chu nawa khawm khuoa a lût chun, Israel mi po po, hruihruol chawiin chu khuoa chun va fêng ei ta, lung chiterek khawm um lo khawp rauin vadungah hnûkthla vawng ei tih,” a ti nghâl bawk a."
14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.","Chuongchun, Absalom le Israel mi po pohai chun, “Ark mi Husai remruot chu Ahithophel remruot nêk chun a ṭha lem,” an ti tah a. LALPA chun Absalom chunga chun thil ṭha naw ân tlungtir theina dingin LALPA chun Ahithophel remruot ṭhatak chu letthla dingin a lo ruot ta hrim a nih."
15,"Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.","Chuongchun, Husai chun thiempu Zadok le Abiathar kuomah, “Chuong ang khâng ang chun Ahithophel chun Absalom le Israel upahai chu rem a ruotpêk a; chun, keiin chuong ang khâng ang chun rem ka ruot bawk a."
16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.","Chuleiin, ‘Vawizân chu thlalêra vadung kaiahai riek ta loin kân ngei ngei rawh, chuong naw chun lal le a kuoma um po pohai chu sukbohmang vawng rawi an tih,’ tiin David chu inhriltir vak ro khai,” a ta."
17,Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.,"Jonathan le Ahimaaz chu En-rogelah an um a, suoknu pa- khat hin anni chu a va hril hlak a na, chun, anni chun lal David chu an va hril nâwk sâwng hlak a; khawpuia an lût chu tukhawma hmu lo ding a nih."
18,"But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.","Nisienlakhawm, naupangin a lo hmuh a, Absalom chu a hril a; chuongchun, an pahni chun an tlân hmang ta vat a, Bahurima mi pakhat, a tuola tuisunsuo nei mi pakhat kâwlah an va feh a, tuisunsuoa chun an lût tah a."
19,"And the woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.","Chun, nuhmeiin tuisunsuo sîn- nain a sîn a, a chunga chun bu a em a, tu hriet thei khawm a ni nawh."
20,"And Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.","Chun, Absalom siehlawhai chu chu ina nuhmei kuoma chun an va feh a, “Ahimaaz le Jonathan kha khaw lai am?” an ta. Chun, nuhmei chun an kuomah, “Vadung kai tâng an tih,” a lo tih a. Chun, an va zawng a, an hmu nawh a, Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a."
21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.","Chun, an fe liem hnung chun tuisunsuoa inthawk chun an hung suok a, lal David chu an va hril a, David kuoma chun, “Suok unla, vadung chu kai vak ro, hieng ang hin Ahithophel chun a phier cheu a nih,” an ta."
22,"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.","Chuongchun, David le a kuoma mi um po pohai chu an suok a, Jordan vadung an kai a, khuo a hung var chun pakhat khawm Jordan vadung kai lo an um nawh."
23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.","Chun, Ahithophel chun a rem- ruot ang chu an pawm nawh ti a hrietin a sabengtung chu a siem a, a suok a, a khuo tieng a fe tah a, a sûnghai khawsak dân ding a ruotpêk diem a, ân âwkhlum tah a; chuong- chun, a thih a, a pa thlânah an phûm tah a."
24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.","Chun, David chun Mahanaim a va tlung a. Chun, Absalom chun a kuoma Israel mi po pohai leh Jordan vadung an kai a."
25,"And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.","Chun, Absalom chun, Joab aiah Amasa chu sipaihai hotuah a sieh a. Amasa chu mi pakhat a hming Ithra, Ismael mi, Joab nu Zeruia zuorpuinu Nahas naunu Abigail pâwltu naupa a nih."
26,And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.,"Chun, Absalom le Israel mihai chun Gilead rama chun ṭhanghmun an va khuor a."
27,"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,","Chun, Davidin Mahanaim a tlung chun Ammon thla Rabba khuoa mi Nahas naupa Sobi hai, Lodebar khuoa mi Ammiel naupa Makir hai, Rogelim khuoa Gilead mi Barzillai hai chun,"
28,"brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched grain, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse,","khumhai dâm, maihûnhai dâm, pil bêlhai dâm, bu dâm, buṭei dâm, beiphit dâm, bu zêu dâm, dailuo dâm, bê dâm,"
29,"and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.","khuoizu dâm, bâwng nêne kîng dâm, berâm le bâwng nêne kîng thûm dâm, David le a kuoma mi umhai fâk dingin an hung chawi a, “Mipuihai chu thlalêra chun an phîngṭamin an chauin an dang châr êm êm tah a nih,” ti a ni sih a."
