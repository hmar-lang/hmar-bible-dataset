1,"And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.","Chun, kum dâm a hung invawi a, lalhai indo dinga an suok hlak lai chun, Davidin Joab chu a tir a, a mihai le Israel mihai po po leh; chun, Ammon thlahai chu an suk- bohmang a, Rabba khuo an inhuol a, David ruok chu Jerusalemah a um a."
2,"And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.","Chun, zântieng nisa innêma chun hieng hi a hung na, David chu a khuma inthawk chun a tho a, lal in inchunga chun a hang lêng a; chun, inchunga inthawk chun nuhmei pakhat insil lai hi a hei hmuh a, chu nuhmei chu hmêl ṭhatak a nih."
3,"And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?","Chun, David chun mi a tir a, chu nuhmei chanchin chu ân dawn feltir a. Chun, mi pakhatin, “Eliam naunu, Bathseba, Hit mi Uria nuhmei a ni naw am a nih?” a tih a."
4,"And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned unto her house.","Chun, David chun mi a tir a, an va ṭhuoi tah a; chun, a kuoma a va tlung chun a lo zâlpui tah a; (a felnaw zo insukthieng laitak a na) chun, a in tieng a fe nâwk tah a."
5,"And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chu a hung inrai tah a, chun, “Nau ka vawn a ni tah,” tiin David chu mi ân hriltir a."
6,"And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.","Chun, David chun Joab kuomah, “Hit mi Uria chu ka kuomah inhung- tir rawh,” tiin ân chah a. Chun, Joab chun Uria chu David kuomah ân fetir a."
7,"And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.","Chun, Uriain a kuom a hang tlung chun, Joab le mihai chu ieng am an chang a, indonahai ieng am an chang ti ân dawn a."
8,"And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king.","Chun, David chun Uria kuomah, “I in tieng fe la, i kehai zu sâwp rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, Uria chu lal ina inthawk chun a suok a, chun, lal chun fâk dinghai leh a hnawtzui a."
9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.","Nisienlakhawm, Uria chu a lalpa siehlawhai lai lal in kawtkhâr bula chun a zâl ve ta el a, a in tieng chun a fe ta nawh a."
10,"And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?","Chun, David chu, “Uria chu a in tieng a fe nawh,” ti an hril phingleh David chun Uria kuoma chun, “Inzin hung i nih a ni naw am a nih? Ieng- dinga i in tieng i fe naw am?” a ta."
11,"And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.","Uria chun David kuomah, “Pathien bâwm le Israelhai le Juda- hai chu bûkah an um a, chun, ka pu Joab le ka pu mihai chu ramhnuoiah an inkul bawk a; kei ka ina fein fain dâwnin, ka nuhmei kuomah ka zâl bîk ding maw? I hringna le i thlarau hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, chu chu thaw naw tawp ka tih,” a ta."
12,"And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.","Chun, David chun Uria kuom- ah, “Vawisûn chu hitaka hin um la, zîngah fe de ti nih,” a ta. Chuong- chun, Uria chu Jerusalema chun chu ni le a zînga khawm chun a um tah a."
13,"And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.","Chun, David chun a ko a, a hmaa chun a fâkin a dâwn a, a sukrui ta dêr a; chun, zântieng chun a in tienga fe loin a pu siehlawhai laia zâl ding chun a suok a."
14,"And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.","Chun, a zîngah zîngkâr chun David chun Joab chu lekha a thawn a, Uria chu ân chawitir a."
15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.","Chun, lekhaa chun, “Uria chu râl zuolna laitaka inhmatâwngtir unla, an thata a thi hlauna dingin thlathlam ro,” tiin a ziek a."
16,"And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were.","Chun, Joab chun khuo chu ân huol vêl lai chun mi huoi huoi umna nia a hrieta chun Uria chu ân ṭhang- tir a."
17,"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.","Chun, khuoa mihai chu an hung suok a, Joab chu an hung thawh a, mi ṭhenkhat David mihai laia mi ngei khawm chu an thih a; chun, Hit mi Uria khawm chu a thih a."
18,Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;,"Chuongchun, Joab chun mi a tir a, indona chungchâng thu tieng po po chu David chu a hril a;"
19,"and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king,","chun, a mi tir kuoma chun, “Lal kuoma indona chanchin po po i hril zo hnungin,"
20,"it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?","a lung a sen thuta, ‘Iengdinga thaw dinga khaw bul ela in fe am a na? Kula inthawkin kâp el an ti cheu ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
21,"who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.","Jerubbeseth naupa Abimelek kha tuin am a that a? Bu râwtnawina lung chunghnung lem nuhmeiin kula inthawkin a chungah a zuk thlâk a, Thebez-a khan a thi a ni naw am a nih? Iengdinga chuong kul bul ela fe am in ni a?’ a ti chun, ‘I siehlaw Uria Hit mi khawm kha a thi annaw,’ ti rawh aw,” tiin a hril a."
22,"So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.","Chuongchun, a mi tir chu a feh a, a va tlung a, Joabin a tirna san po po chu David chu a hril tah a."
23,"And the messenger said unto David, The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate.","Chun, a mi tir chun David kuoma chun, “Mihai chun an mi hung nawr a, phûlah an mi hung thawh a; keini chun an khaw lûtna kawtkhâr tlung rakin kan nawr ve thung a."
24,"And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.","Chun, kâptuhai chun kula inthawk chun i siehlawhai chu an kâp a, chuongchun, lal siehlaw ṭhenkhat- hai chu an thih a; chun, i siehlaw Hit mi Uria khawm kha a thi annaw,” a ta."
25,"Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.","David chun a mi tir kuoma chun, “Joab kuoma chun hieng ang hin va hril rawh, ‘Hieng hin i lungril chu suklâwm naw chuong naw raw se, kâwlhnâm chun tu tu khawm a thlierbîk si nawh a, nasa nâwkzuolin khuo chu thaw unla, sukse ro,’ tiin infui rawh,” a ta."
26,"And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.","Chun, Uria nuhmei chun a pasal Uria a thi ti a hriet chun a pasal chu a sûn a."
27,"And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah.","Chun, a sûn hunbi a bo hnung chun David chun ama in tieng ân ṭhuoitir a, a nuhmeiah a nei tah a, naupasal a neipêk a. Nisienlakhawm, David thilthaw chun LALPA a suklungni nawh a."
