1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.","Saula sûnghai le David sûnghai chu sâwttak an indo a, David chu a hung hrât tiel tiel a, Saula sûnghai ruok chu an hung hrât naw tiel tiel tah a."
2,"And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;","Chun, David chun Hebron khuoa chun naupasalhai a nei a, a naupa hmasa tak chu Ammon, Jezreel mi Ahinoam le an inkâra mi a nih;"
3,"and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;","a dawttu chu Kileab, Karmela mi Nabal nuhmei Abigail le an kâra mi a nih; chun, a pathumna chu Absalom, Gesur lal Talmai naunu Maaka naupa a na."
4,"and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;","Chun, a palina chu Adonija, Haggith naupa a nih, a pangana chu Sephatia, Abital naupa a nih;"
5,"and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.","chun, a parukna chu Ithream, David nuhmei Egla le an kâra mi a nih. Hieng hai hi David nau Hebrona pienghai chu an nih."
6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.","Chun, Saula sûnghai le David sûnghai chu an indo lai chun, Abner chu Saula sûnghai laia chun ân sukhrât ta deu deu a."
7,"Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?","Saula chun hmei a nei a, a hming chu Rizpa, Aia naunu a nih. Chun, Is-boseth chun Abner kuomah, “Ieng- dinga ka pa hmeinu kuomah i fe am?” a ta."
8,"Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.","Chuongchun, Is-boseth thuhril chun Abner chu a suklungsen ta êm êm el a, “Judahai ui lu el am ka nih? Vawisûn chen hin i pa Saula sûnghai le a unauhai le a ruolhai chungah zainêmna ka suklang a, David kutah kân hlân naw cheh a, nisienlakhawm, nangin hi nuhmei chunga hin suolah i mîn tum el a."
9,"God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;","LALPAIN a kuoma ṭawng a lo inkhâm ta anga David ta dinga ka thaw naw chun Abner chu a law law law el sienla, chu nêka nasa khawmin."
10,"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.","Saula sûnghaia inthawka ram chu lâkpêk a, Israel le Judahai chungah Dana inthawka Beer-seba chena David lalṭhungpha tungding dinga ka va thaw naw chun,” a ta."
11,"And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.","Chuongchun, a ṭi êm leiin Abner chu a dawn khawm a dawn ngam ta nawh a."
12,"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.","Chun, Abner chun ama aiawin David kuoma chun, “Hi ram hi tu ta am a nih a?” tiin mitirhai a tir a; chun, “Ka kuomah thu thlung rawh, chuongchun, ngai ta, Israel mi po po i kuom tienga ṭhang dingin ka kut chu nangma tieng ṭhang a tih,” tiin a hril nâwk a."
13,"And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.","Chun, ama chun, “Aw le, i kuoma chun thu thlung ka tih, ami- ruokchu, nangma kuomah thil pakhat ka phût ding a nih, chu chu hi hi a nih; mi hmu dinga i hung phaleh Saula naunu Mikal kha i hung ṭhuoi phawt naw chun ka hmêl hmu thei naw ti nih,” a ta."
14,"And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.","Chun, David chun Saula naupa Is-boseth kuoma chun, “Philistin mihai ser vun za khata kân châwk ka nuhmei Mikal chu mi hung pe rawh,” tiin mihai a tir a."
15,"And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.","Chun, Is-boseth chun mi a tir a, a pasal La-is naupa Paltiel kuom ngeia inthawk chun an ṭhuoi tah a."
16,"And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.","Chun, a pasal chu a kuoma chun a feh a, ṭap malam peiin a feh a, Bahurim chenin a zui a. Chuongchun, Abner chun a kuomah, “Fe rawh, kîr nâwk el rawh,” a tih a, chun, a kîr nâwk tah a."
17,"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:","Chuongchun, Abner chun Israel mihai upahai chu a biek a, “Kha hma khan David chu in chunga lala um dingin in dit hlak a;"
18,"now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.","tuhin siem ta ro khai LALPAIN David chungchâng thua chun, ‘Ka siehlaw David kutin ka mi Israelhai chu Philistin mihai kuta inthawk le, an hmêlmahai po po kuta inthawkin sansuok ka tih,’ tiin a hril a nih,” tiin."
19,"And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.","Chun, Abner chun Benjamin mihai na hrieta chun a hril bawk a; chun, Abner chu Israel mihai le Benjamin sûng po pohaiin ṭha an ti ang taphawt Hebrona David na hrieta hril dingin a fe bawk a."
20,"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.","Chuongchun, Abner chu Hebrona David kuoma chun mi sâwmhni leh an feh a. Chun, David chun Abner le a kuoma mi sâwm- hnihai ta ding chun ruoi a ṭheh a."
21,"And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.","Abner chun David kuoma chun, “Tho ka ta, i kuoma thu an thlung theina ding le, i duthusâm angtaka ro i rêl theina dingin Israel mi po pohai ka lalpa kuoma hin hung kei khâwm dingin fêng ka tih,” a ta. Chun, David chun Abner chu ân fetir a, chuong- chun, lungmuongtak chun a fe tah a."
22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.","Chun, ngai ta, David mihai le Joab mihai rammu chu an hung a, râllâk tamtak an hung lâk a, nisienlakhawm, Abner chu Hebrona David kuoma chun a lo um ta nawh a; a lo infetir ta sih a, ama khawm chu lungmuongtakin a lo fe tah a nih."
23,"When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.","Joab le a kuoma mipui po po an hung tlung chun, “Nera naupa Abner chu lal kuomah a hung a, ama chun a lo infetir nâwk tah a, lungmuong- takin a fe nâwk tah,” tiin Joab chu an hril a."
24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?","Chuongchun, Joab chu lal kuoma chun a feh a, “I thil lo thaw hi iengtizie am a ni leh? Ngai ta, Abner chu i kuomah a hung a, iengdinga în fetir a, a fe dai el am a ni ta leh?"
25,"Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.","Nera naupa Abner chu i hriet a, i suok i lût le i thilthaw iengkim hriet tuma hung a na,” a ta."
26,"And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.","Chun, David kuoma inthawka Joab a hung suok chun Abner hnawt ding chun mi a tir a, Sira tuisunsuoa inthawkin an hung ṭhuoikîr a, nisien- lakhawm, David chun a hriet nawh."
27,"And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.","Chun, Abner chun Hebron a hung tlung chun Joab chun kul kawt- khârah biekrûk dingin a ṭhuoi hran a, a unau Asahel thisen suok thungna dingin a phîngah a sun hlum tah a."
28,"And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:","Chun, a nakiea Davidin a hung hriet chun, “Nera naupa Abner thisen insuo thua hin kei le ka ram chu LALPA mithmuin inthieng kum- khuong kan ta,"
29,"let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.","Joab lu chungah tla sienla, a pa sûnghai po po chunga leh; Joab sûng- haia inthawka thil pût amanih, phâr amanih, hmawl ringsana um mi amanih, kâwlhnâma thi amanih, ṭâm amanih hung um loin um naw raw se,” a ta."
30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.","Chuongchun, an unaupa Asahel chu Gibeona indonaa a that leiin Joab le a unau Abisai chun Abner chu an that tah a."
31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.","Chun, David chun Joab le a kuoma mipui po pohai kuoma chun, “In puonhai chu keithlêr unla, saiip puon sil unla, Abner chu sûn ro,” a ta. Chun, lal David chun hlâng chu a zui a."
32,"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.","Chun, Abner chu Hebrona chun an phûm a, lal chun a râwl ân suoh a. Abner thlâna chun a ṭap tah a; mipui po po khawm an ṭap a."
33,"And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?","Chun, lal chun Abner chu a ṭah a, “Abner chu invêt thiin a thi el ding a ni maw?"
34,"Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him.","I kut hai chu khuop a ni nawh a, i ke hai chu kawl inbun a ni bawk nawh, Mi rilo nauhai hmaa mi a tlûk anga i tlûk el ta chu?” a ta. Chun, mi po po chun ama an ṭa nâwk a."
35,"And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.","Chuongchun, sûn a la ni laiin David chu bu infâktir dingin mi po po chu an hung a; nisienlakhawm, David chun, “Nisa tlâk hmaa bu amanih thil dang amani khawm a fâka ka fâk vai chun Pathien chun a law law mi law raw se, chu nêka nasa khawmin,” tiin ṭawng ân khâm a."
36,"And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.","Chu chu mi po poin an hriet chun an lâwm êm êm a, lal thilthaw taphawthai chun mipuihai po po chu a suklâwm pei a."
37,So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.,"Chuongchun, mipui po po le Israel mi po pohai chun Nera naupa Abner thata um chu lal thu a ni nawh ti an hriet tah a."
38,"And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?","Chun, lal chun a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “Vawisûn hin Israel mi lien, mi ropuitak a thi ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
39,"And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.","Lal dinga hrieknâl ni lang khawm, vawisûn hin ka hrât naw a nih; chun, hieng Zeruia nauhai hi ka ta dingin tuor hla an um taluo a nih; LALPAIN thil ṭha naw thawtu chu a suolzie ang peiin thung raw se,” a ta."
