1,"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, chuong hnunga chun Ammon thlahai lal chu a thih a, a naupa Hanun chu a aiawin ân lal a."
2,"And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.","David chun, “A pa chun a mi lo lunginsiet angin kei khawma Nahas naupa Hanun chu lunginsiet vêng ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chun a pa chungchâng thua thlamuon dingin ama mihai a tir a. Chun, David mihai chun Ammon thlahai ram chu an va tlung a."
3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?","Nisienlakhawm, Ammon thlahai lusahairawi chun an lal Hanun kuoma chun, “David hin i pa ân za leiin i kuoma hin thlamuontu a hung tir niin i ring am a ni? David hin khawpui a hne theina dingin a siehlawhai khawpuia hin enthlatu le enfietu dingin a hung tir a ni lem naw am a nih?” an ta."
4,"So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.","Chuongchun, Hanun chun David mihai chu a man a, an khâkhmul chenve a vâwpêk a; chun, an silfênhai chu a laitakah an mawng tlung chau- in a tanpêk bawk a, ân fetir tah a."
5,"When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.","Chun, David chu an hang hril chun, a tuok dingin mi a tir a, anni chu an inzak hle el sih a. Chun, lal chun, “In khâkhmulhai a mâwng sei hma po chu Jerikoah um hri unla, chu hnunga chun hung de ti niu,” a ta."
6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chun David theida zâwng an lo ni tah ti an hung inhriet chun Ammon thlahai chun Beth-rehoba mi Suria mihai le Zobaa mi Suria mihai, sipai sîng hni le, lal Maaka mi sîng khat leh, Topa mihai sîng khat le sâng hni leh an inchah a, an ruoi a."
7,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.","Chun, David chun chu chu a hrietin Joab le sipai huoisenhai po po a tir a."
8,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chu an hung suok a, khaw lûtna kawtkhâr tienga chun ṭhanghmun an siem a; chun, Zoba mihai le Rehoba mihai Suria mihai le Toba le Maaka mihai ruok chu a tumin phûlah an um a."
9,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:","Chuongchun, an hma tieng le an hnungtieng an hung thaw ding a ni ti Joabin a hriet chun Israel mihai laia a ṭha ṭha a thlangsuok a, Suria mihai chu do dingin ṭhanghmun a lo khawh a."
10,and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.,"Chun, mi dang po po chu a unaupa Abisai kutah a sie vawng a, Ammon thlahai chu thaw dingin ṭhanghmun a khaw bawk a."
11,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.","“Suria mihai hi ka hne naw ding chun nangin mi ṭhangpui i ta, chun, nangin Ammon thlahai hi i hne naw ding chun hung ṭhangpui ka ti che."
12,"Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.","Huoitakin um unla, ei mihai le ei Pathien khuohai sanin insuk pasal ei tiu; chun, LALPA chun ṭha a ti ang peiin thaw raw se,” a ta."
13,So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.,"Chuongchun, Joab le a kuoma mihai chun Suria mihai chu do dingin indona hmun tieng chu an va hnai a; chun, a hmaa chun an tlânsieh a."
14,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chun Suria mihai an tlânsie ti an hriet chun anni khawm chu Abisai hmaa chun an tlânse ve tah a; khuoa chun an lût a. Chun, Joab chun Ammon thlahai chu a kîrsan a, Jerusalemah a fe tah a."
15,"And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.","Chun, Suria mihaiin Israelhai hmaa chun an chan a hung chau tah ti an hriet chun an inpun khâwm a."
16,"And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.","Chun, Hadadezer chun mi a tir a, Vadung khêla Suria mihai chu a ṭhuoi suok a, Hadadezer sipai hotu Sobak chun hma a ṭhuoi a; Helamah an hung a."
17,"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.","Chun, chu chu David an hril a; chun, ama chun Israel mi po po a ko khâwm a, Jordan vadung an kai a, Helama chun an feh a. Chun, Suria mihai chun David chu do dingin ṭhanghmun an lo siem a, an lo thawh a."
18,"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.","Chun, Suria mihai chu Israel- hai hmaa chun an tlânse tah a; chun, David chun Suria mi tawlailîr za sari chunga chuong le sakawr chung chuong mi sîng li a that a; chun, an sipai hotu Sobak khawm a that a, chutaka chun a thi tah a."
19,"And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.","Chuongchun, Hadadezer hnuoia lal siehlawa umhai po po chun Israel- hai hmaah an chan a chau tah ti an lo hriet chun, Israelhai leh inremna an siem a, an siehlawhaiah an um tah a. Chuongchun, Suria mihai chun Ammon thlahai chu an ṭhangpui ngam nâwk ta nawh a."
