1,"And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,","Chun, lal chu a inah a um a, LALPAIN an vêla a hmêlmahai po poa inthawka râlmuonga ân umtir hnung chun,"
2,"that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.","lal chun zâwlnei Nathan kuom- ah, “Hi, kei chu sidar thing inah ka um a, Pathien bâwm ruok chu puon in elah a um a,” a tih a."
3,"And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.","Chun, Nathan chun lal kuomah, “I lungrila a um ang tak chun va thaw rawh, LALPA i kuomah a um annâwm,” a tih a."
4,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,","Chun, chu zân vêk chun Nathan kuomah LALPA thu a hung tlung a,"
5,"Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?","“Fe la, ka siehlaw David chu va hril rawh, ‘LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih; Ka umna dingin nangin in i mi bâwlpêk ding am a nih?"
6,"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.","Israel thlahai Aigupta rama inthawka ka ṭhuoi suoka inthawkin tu chen hin inah ka um ngai nawh a, puon ina le biekbûkah ka um pei lem hlak a."
7,"In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?","Israel thlahai lai po poah, ka fena taphawtahai khawm, ka mi Israelhai châwm dinga thu ka ipêk rorêltuhai kuomah, Iengdinga sidar thinga in i mi bâwlpêk naw am a na,’ tiin ka hril hlak am a nih?"
8,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;","Chuleiin, ka siehlaw David kuomah, Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘berâm tlatna hmuna inthawka i berâm vêng lai chun ka mi Israelhai chunga hotu dingin ka lâk cheh a;"
9,"and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.","chun, i fena taphawtah i kuomah ka um pei a, i hmaa chun i hmêlmahai ka sukbo pei a, hnuoia mi ropuitakhai hming ang hming ropuitak siempêk ka ti che."
10,"And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,","Chun, ka mi Israelhai ta dingin hmun ruot ka ta, anni ngei puol hmuna an um a, an insawn ta nawna dingin anni chu phun ka ta, kha hma ang khan mi rilohaiin sukrimsi ta naw ni hai a;"
11,and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.,"ka mi Israelhai chunga rorêl- tuhai ka ruot lai ang kha ni bawk ta naw nih; chun, i hmêlmahai po poa inthawk hin inchâwltir ka ti che. Chun, chu naw hrima khawm, LALPAIN, LALPA chun sûngkuo indinpêk a ti che ti a hril a nih."
12,"When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.","I nihai a kina, i puhai kuoma i zâl pha chun, i hnunga i thla, i rîla ra ding chu tungding ka ta, a ram chu sukdet ka tih."
13,"He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.","Ama chun ka hming dingin in bâwl a ta; chun, a ram lalṭhungpha chu kumkhuoa dingin suknghet ka tih."
14,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;","A pa nîng ka ta, ama chu ka naupa nîng a ta, thil a suksuol chun mihriem nauhai hmawl le mihriem nauhai vuoknain thunun ka ta;"
15,"but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.","nisienlakhawm, i hmaa ka sawnhmang Saula kuoma inthawka ka lâk hmang ang khan ka zangaina chun ama chu mâksan naw nih."
16,And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.,"Chun, i sûngkuo le i ram chu chatuona suknghet tlat nîng a ta, i lalṭhungpha chu chatuona suknghet nîng a tih,’ a tih,” tiin LALPA thu a hung tlung a."
17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.","Chuong thu po po ang le, chu inlârna ang chie chun Nathanin David kuoma chun a hril a."
18,"Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?","Chuongchun, lal David chu a lût a, LALPA hmaa chun a ṭhung a, “Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, tu am ka na, ka sûnghai tu am an na, hi chen chen hi i mi ṭhuoi?"
19,"And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!","Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, chuong khawm chu nanga mithmua chun thil chîn tham el chu a na, nisienlakhawm, i siehlaw sûngkuo hung umdân ding chu kum tamtak sûnga khan i lo hril ta bawk a, Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, hienghai khawm hi mihriemhai thaw dân ang bawk a na."
20,"And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah.","David hin i kuomah ieng am hril nâwk chuong tâng a ta? I siehlaw hi i hriet vawng si, Aw Lalpa PATHIEN."
21,"For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.",I siehlaw hriet dingin i thu lei le nangma lungril ang peiin hieng thil ropuitak hi i thaw tah a.
22,"Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.","Chuleichun, Aw LALPA Pa- thien, nang chu i ropui a nih, kan naa kan hriet angin nanga ang hrim hrim an um nawh a, nangma naw chu Pathien hrim hrim an um bawk nawh."
23,"And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemedst to thee out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?","Aigupta rama inthawk le hnam tin le an pathienhaia inthawka i ta dinga în tlansuok, i mihai hmaa i ta dinga thil ropuitak le i ram ta dinga thil ṭiumtak thaw ding le ama hming ropuitak siem dinga Pathienin ama mihai ni dinga a hung intlansuok i mi Israelhai ang hrim hrim hi khawvêla hin hnam dang tu am an um a?"
24,"And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.","Chuongchun, i mi Israelhai chu chatuona i mihai an ni theina dingin i ta dingin i suknghet tah a; chun, LALPA, nang chu an Pathien i hung ni tah a."
25,"And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.","Chuongchun, Aw LALPA Pa- thien, i siehlaw chungchâng thu le a sûnghai chungchâng thu i hril chu chatuona dingin suknghet la, i hril ta ang khan thaw rawh."
26,"And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.","Chun, ‘Sipaihai LALPA chu Israelhai Pathien a nih,’ tiin, i hming chu chatuona chawimawiin um raw se; chuongchun, i siehlaw David sûng- hai hi i hmaa suknghetin um an tih."
27,"For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.","Aw Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien, i siehlaw kuomah, ‘Sûngkuo chu inngîrpêk ka ti che,’ tiin i phuong ta sih a, chuleiin, i siehlaw hin hi ṭawngṭaina hi i kuomah ân tlun ngam a nih."
28,"And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:","Aw LALPA Pathien, Nang chu Pathien i na, i thu chu thutak a na; chun, hi thilṭha hi i siehlaw kuoma chun i tiem tah a;"
29,"now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.","chuleiin, i siehlaw sûnghai chu i hmaa chatuona an um zing theina dingin malsâwm la, aw LALPA Pathien, nang chun i hril ta sih a; chun, i malsâwmnain i siehlaw sûng- hai chu chatuona malsâwmin um raw se,” a ta."
