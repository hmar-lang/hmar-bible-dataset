1,"And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:","Chun, David chun a hmêl- mahai po po kuta inthawk le Saula kuta inthawk LALPAIN a sansuok ni chun hi hla thu hi LALPA kuomah a hril a;"
2,"and he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;","chuongchun, ama chun: “LALPA chu ka lungpui le ka kulpui le a mi sanhimtu a na, ka ta ngei a nih;"
3,"God, my rock, in him will I take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence.","Ka lungpui, Pathien ama chu ring ka ta, Ka phaw le ka sandamna ki, ka kulbîng insâng le kân humhimna a nih; Ka sandamtu, nangin inpâwngnêknaa inthawkin i mi sandam hlak."
4,"I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.","Inpâktlâk LALPA chu ko ka ta, Chuongchun, a mi dotuhaia inthawka sandamin um ka tih."
5,For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:,"Thina hung insawk chun a mîn huol vêl a, Pathien ngaisak nawna tuilien chun a mi suklau a."
6,The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.,"Seol hruihruolhai chun a mi khuop vêl a, Thina chânghai chun a mi âwk bawk a."
7,"In my distress I called upon Jehovah; Yea, I called unto my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry came into his ears.","Ka lunginzîngin LALPA chu ka ko a, Anih, ka Pathien chu ka ko hlak. Chun, ama chun a biekina inthawk chun ka râwl chu a hriet a, Chun, ka khêkri chu a naa chun a lût tah a."
8,"Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.","Chu phingle chun hnuoi hi ân hning a, ân thin tah a, A lunginsen leiin vân innghatna chenin ân hnîngin ân thin tah a."
9,"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.","A hnâra inthawk chun meikhu ân tung ta ngut ngut a, A baua suok mei chun a kâng ta dur dur a; Chu chun meihawl khawm chu a sukchawk ta dur dur a."
10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.","Ama chun vânhai khawm a sukkûn a, a ṭum tah a, A ke hnuoiahai chun inthim sâmup hi a hung um a."
11,"And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.","Cherub chungah a chuong a, a vuong tah a, Anih, thli thlaahai chun an hmuh a."
12,"And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.","Inthim chu ama inhuol vêlna bûktêah a siem a, Tuihai, vâna sûm sâmuphai chu fâwkkhâwmin,"
13,At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.,"A hmaa varna lei chun, Meilinghai chu a chawk a."
14,"Jehovah thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice.","LALPA chu vâna khin a hung inri dur dur a, Achunghnungtak chun a râwl ân suoh a."
15,"And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them.","Chun, thalhai chu a kâp suok a, anni chu a sukdar a, Kâwl dâm ân leptir a, a sukbuoi tah a."
16,"Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.","Chu phingleh LALPA kâwkna leia, A hnâra inthuok suokin a mût rak lei chun, Leihnuoi innghatnahai chu suklangin a um tah a."
17,"He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;","Ama chun chung tienga inthawkin a hung ban a, a mi chel a, Tui tamtaka inthawk chun a mi hnûk dawk a."
18,"He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.","A mi dotu hrâttaka inthawk chun a mi sanhim a, A mi theidatuhaia inthawk leh, keia ta ding chun an hrât talaw sih a."
19,They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.,"Anni chun ka vângsiet ni chun an mi hung thawh a, Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chu kân nghatna tak a nih."
20,"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.","Ama chun hmun inthâwltakah a mi ṭhuoi suok a, Ka chunga a lâwm leiin a mi lo sanhim tah a nih."
21,Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.,"LALPA chun ka felzie ang peiin ka chungah a thawh a, Ka kuthai ân thieng ang ngeiin a mi thung a nih."
22,"For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.","LALPA lampuihai chu ka hrawh a, Ka Pathien kuoma inthawk chun suoltakin ka fe hmang ngai si nawh a."
23,"For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.","A rorêlna po po ka hmaah a um hlak a, A thuruothai hlak chu ka nghatsan ngai si nawh a."
24,I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from mine iniquity.,"Ama kuoma chun hrilsietbo ka ni bawk a, Ka rîtlonaa inthawkin kân siekieng hlak a."
25,"Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun ka felzie ang peiin a mi lo thung tah a; A mithmua kân thiengzie ang peiin."
26,With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;,"Mi lunginsiet theihai kuoma chun lunginsiet theitakin insuklang i ta, Mi ṭha famkimhai kuoma chun ṭha famkimin insuklang i tih."
27,With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.,"Mi inthieng kuoma chun inthiengin insuklang i ta, Chun, mi kâwmaw kuoma chun kâwmaw angin insuklang i tih."
28,"And the afflicted people thou wilt save; But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.","Rinum tuor mihai chu sandam i ta, Mi chapohai ruok chu i suktlâwm theina dingin an chungah i mit a fu zing a."
29,"For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah; And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.","Aw LALPA, khâwnvar i ni sih a; LALPA chun kân thimna hi sukvar a tih."
30,For by thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall.,"Nangma ṭhangpuiin râl ka baw sih a, Ka Pathien ṭhangpui bawkin kul kân châwmhlên a nih."
31,"As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.","Pathien chu a lampui a ṭha famkim a, LALPA thu chu inchien a ni tah. Ama ringtuhai po po ta dingin ama chu phaw a nih."
32,"For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?",LALPA naw chu tu am Pathien an um? Ei Pathien naw chu tu am lungpui an um a?
33,God is my strong fortress; And he guideth the perfect in his way.,"Pathien chu ka kulpui nghettak a na, Mi ṭha famkim chu a lampuiah a ṭhuoi hlak."
34,"He maketh his feet like hinds’ feet, And setteth me upon my high places.","Ka kehai chu sazukpui ke angin a siem a, Ka hmun insângahai a mîn umtir hlak."
35,"He teacheth my hands to war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.","Ka kuthai hi râl kâp dingin ân chûktir hlak a, Chuongchun, ka bânhai hin dâr thalngul a kuoi zo hiel a."
36,Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy gentleness hath made me great.,Nangin i sandamna phaw chu i mi pêk bawk a; I înngaitlâwmna chun i mi siem lien tah.
37,Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped.,"Ka hnuoia ka kalchawina chu i suklien a, Chuongchun, ka kehai hi ân tleu nawh a."
38,"I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.","Ka hmêlmahai chu ka hnawt phâk a,ka sukbohmang a, Sukbohmang dêra an um hmakhat chun ka kîr nawh."
39,"And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise: Yea, they are fallen under my feet.","An tho nâwk thei nawna dingin ka sukbohmang dêr a, ka sât fik a; Anih, ka ke hnuoiah an tlu tah a."
40,For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.,"Nangin inthawnaa ding chun ka taiah hrâtnain i mi hrên sih a, A mi hung thawtuhai chu ka hnuoiah i tukdawl tah a."
41,"Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.","A mi theidatuhai chu ka sukbohmang theina dingin, Nangin a mi dotuhai chu mi hnunginnghatin în umtir ta bawk a."
42,"They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.","An ngha vêl a, nisienlakhawm, sandamtu ding tukhawm an um nawh a; LALPA ngei chu an hang en a, nisienlakhawm, a dawn si nawh."
43,"Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.","Chu phingle chun hnuoia pilvut ang elin ka vuok phit a, Khawlai chirhak ang elin ka sukhmât a, ka sukdar tah a."
44,Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.,"Nangin ka mihai insuolnaa inthawk khawmin i mi sanhim tah a, Hnam tin lu chu ni dingin i mi vawng ṭha a. Ka hriet ngai naw hnam chun ka rawng bâwl tâng an tih."
45,"The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.","Hnam danghai chu ka kuomah inpêng an ta, Ka chanchin an hriet phingleh ka thu zâwm an tih."
46,"The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.","Hnam danghai chu chul an ta, An kulbînghaia inthawk dâm chun inthin pumin hung suok an tih."
47,"Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,","LALPA chu a hring zing a, ka lungpui chu inpâkin um raw se; A mi sandamna lungpui, Pathien chu chawimawiin um raw se."
48,"Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And that bringeth down peoples under me,","Phuba mi lapêktu le, Hnam tin ka hnuoia tukdawltu Pathien ngei chu."
49,"And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.","A mi dotuhaia inthawka a mi la suoktu, Anih, nangin a mi thawtuhai chungtieng chun i mi dawm kâng a; Mi nunsiea inthawk chun i mi sanhim hlak."
50,"Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.","Chuleiin, aw LALPA, hnam tinhai lai chun lâwmthu hril ka ti cheh a, I hming inpâkin hla sak bawk ka tih."
51,"Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.","Ama chun sandamna ropuitak a lal a pêk hlak a; A hrieknâl chungah, David le a thlahai chung ngeia chun, Kumkhuoin a zainêmzie inlangtir a tih,” a tih a."
