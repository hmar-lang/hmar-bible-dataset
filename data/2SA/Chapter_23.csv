1,"Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse saith, And the man who was raised on high saith, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel:","Hieng hi David thuhril nuhnung tak a nih, Jesai naupa David chun a hril a; “Insângtaka dawm sânga, Jakob Pathien hrieknâl, Israelhai hla mawitak phuoktu chun a hril a;"
2,"The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me, And his word was upon my tongue.","LALPA thlarau chun keima mi hmangin a hril a, A thu chu ka leiah a um a."
3,"The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spake to me: One that ruleth over men righteously, That ruleth in the fear of God,","Israelhai Pathien chun a hril a, Israelhai lungpui chun: ‘Mi chunga feltaka rorêl hlaka, Pathien ṭi puma rorêl hlak chu,"
4,"He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, A morning without clouds, When the tender grass springeth out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.","Nisa a hung suok a, sûm um dêr lo, Zîng khawvar ang hi nîng a ta; Raw sûr zoa khuo hung inthienga, Hnuoia hlohna inder no hlap ang hi nîng a tih."
5,"Verily my house is not so with God; Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in all things, and sure: For it is all my salvation, and all my desire, Although he maketh it not to grow.","Ei sûngkuo chu Pathien kuoma inthawk a ni naw am a nih? Chatuon thuthlung ka kuomah a thlung a; Iengkim fel le suknghet tlatin; Ka sandamna kim le duthusâm kim, Ân der suoktir naw ding maw?"
6,"But the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away, Because they cannot be taken with the hand;","Mi rilohai chu an rênga a hnâwla hnâwlhmang mi, hling ang nîng an ta, Kuta lâk mi an ni si nawh."
7,But the man that toucheth them Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear: And they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.,"A tâwktu ding chun thîr le fei ngul ruoi lem ding a na, Chuongchun, an hmuna raw- hmang vawng nîng an tih,’ tiin a mi biek a,” tiin."
8,"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.","Hieng hi David sipai huoisenhai hming chu a nih; Takemon mi Joseb-bassebeth chu sipai hotuhai laia hotu tak a na, ama chu ṭum khata mi za riet thattu Aznit mi Adino an ti bawk kha a nih."
9,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.","Chun, a dawttu chu Aho mi naupa Dodai naupa Eleazar a na, ama chu Philistin mihai indo dinga an pungkhâwm a, an cho a, Israel mihai an fe hmang vawng laia David kuoma sipai huoisen pathumhai laia pakhat kha a nih."
10,"He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword; and Jehovah wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.","Ama chu a tho a, Philistin mihai chu kut kham rak khawpin, a kâwlhnâm khawm inlet theilo rak khawpin a that a, chu ni chun LALPAIN nasatakin a ngampêk a; chun, mipuihai chu a hnungah râllâk thil la ding ngawtin an hung kîr nâwk a."
11,"And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.","Chun, chu dawttu chu Hara mi, Agee naupa Samma a na. Dailuo umna hmunah Philistin mihai chu lâk tumin an inkhâwm a, chun, mipuihai chun Philistin mihai chu an tlânsiet san a."
12,"But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great victory.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu chu hmuna chun a ngîr a, a vêng tlat a, Philistin mihai chu a that a, chun, LALPAIN nasatakin a ngampêk a."
13,"And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.","Chun, sipai huoi sâwmthum laia pathumhai chu an zu feh a; bu sîk lai takin David kuomah Adullam pûkah an feh a; chun, Philistin sipai- hai chun Rephaim kâwnah ṭhang- hmun an khuor a."
14,And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.,"Chuong lai chun David chu kulbîngah a um a, chuong lai bawk chun Philistin sipaihai chu Bethle- hemah an um a."
15,"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!","Chun, David chun tui a châk êm êm el a, “Bethlehema tuisunsuo tui, kul kawtkhâr kâwla mi kha dâwn dinga mi pe um ta ve hai sienla aw,” a ta."
16,"And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah.","Chuongchun, sipai huoisen pathumhai chun, Philistin sipaihai chu an nêr thleng a, kul kawtkhâr kâwla mi, Bethlehema tuisunsuo chu an va thâl a; an chawi a, David kuomah an fepui a, nisienlakhawm, a lo dâwn nuom nawh a, LALPA ta dingin a bunthlâk ta lem a."
17,"And he said, Be it far from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.","“Aw LALPA, hi hi ka thaw naw dingzie chu, thi huoma fehai thisen chu ka dâwn ding am a nih?” a ta; chuongchun, a dâwn nuom ta nawh a. Chuong thilhai chu sipai huoisen pathumhai chun an thaw a nih."
18,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.","Zeruia naupa Joab unaupa Abisai chu sâwmthumhai laia hotu tak a na, ama chun za thumhai chunga chun a fei chu a phawi a, anni chu a that a, Pathumhai laia chun hming ṭhat a hlaw a."
19,Was he not most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.,"Sâwmthumhai laia chun chawimawi tlâk tak a ni naw am a nih? Chuleiin, an hotuah an siem a, nisienlakhawm, a chunghnung tak pathum laia tiemsa a kai nawh."
20,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.","Chun, Kabzeel mi huoi naupa Jehoiada naupa Benaia thil nasatak thawtu chun Moab mi Ariel naupasal pahnihai chu a that a; chun, a zu feh a, vûr tlâk hun laiin khursûngah sakeibaknei a zu that bawk a."
21,"And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.","Chun, Aigupta mi, mi lientak a that a; Aigupta mi chun a fei a chawi a, nisienlakhawm, ama chun hmawl chawiin a zuk pan a, Aigupta mi fei chawi chu a lâkpêk a, ama fei ma chun a sun hlum tah a."
22,"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.",Jehoiada naupa Benaia chun chuong ang thil chu a thaw leiin sipai huoisen pathumhai laia chun hming- ṭhat a hlawh a.
23,"He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.","Mi sâwmthumhai nêk chun chawimawi tlâk a ni hrim a, nisienla- khawm, achunghnung tak pathum- hai laia tiemsa a kai nawh. Chun, David chun ama vêngtu hotuah a sieh a."
24,"Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,","Joab unaupa Asahel chu sâwmthumhai laia pakhat chu a na; Bethlehem khuoa mi Dodo naupa Elhanan,"
