1,"And when David was a little past the top of the ascent, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.","David chun tlâng sîp lâwn suokna a khêl dep chun, ngai ta, Mephiboseth siehlaw Ziba chun a lo tuok a, sabengtung pahni a hmang a, bei tlang zahni le grêp emṭâwl bâwr za le nipui thei za le uoin peng khat ân phurtir a."
2,"And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.","Chun, lal chun Ziba kuoma chun, “Hieng hi iengtizie am a nih a?” a ta. Ziba chun, “Sabengtunghai hi lal sûnghai chuongna ding nîng a ta, bei le nipui theihai hi tlangvâlhai fâk ding nîng a ta; uoin hi chu thlalêra châu taphawthai dâwn ding nîng a tih,” a ta."
3,"And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.","Chun, lal chun “Anleh, i pu naupa chu khâwlai am?” a ta. Ziba chun lal kuomah, “Ngai ta, Jerusa- lemah a um, ‘Vawisûn hin Israel- hai chun ka pa ram an mi pêk nâwk ding a nih,’ a ti nghe nghe annâw,” a ta."
4,"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.","Chun, lal chun Ziba kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, Mephiboseth thil nei po po chu i ta vawng a ni tah,” a ta. Chun, Ziba chun, “Chibai ka bûk takzet che a nih, aw lalpa ka pu, i mit tlunga um pei tum ka tih,” a ta."
5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.","Chun, lal Davidin Bahurim a tlung chun, ngai ta, Saula sûnghai laia mi Gera naupa a hming Simei a hung suok a, ṭawngsie inphur pum peiin a hung suok a."
6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.","David chu lungin a dêng a, lal David siehlawhai po po khawm chu; chun, mipui po po le sipai huoisenhai po po chu a changtieng le a vawitieng an um a."
7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:","Chun, Simei chun ṭawngsie ân phur sûng chun hieng hin a hril a, “Fe hmang dai rawh, fe hmang dai rawh, nang thisen insuo hmang le Belial mihriempa,"
8,"Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.","a rorêl âi i rêl tah Saula sûnghai thisen chu LALPAIN i chungah a hung inlettir tah a; chun, LALPAIN ram chu i naupa Absalom chu a pêk tah a; chun, ngai ta, thisen insuo- hmang i ni leiin nangma pawi chu nang bawkin i tâwk a nih,” a ta."
9,"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.","Chuongchun, Zeruia naupa Abisai chun lal kuomah, “Iengdinga hi ui thitlaw hin ka lalpa lal chu ṭawngsie ân phur mei mei am a nih a? a lu va tan el ka tih aw?” a ta."
10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?","Nisienlakhawm, lal chun, “Nangni Zeruia naupasalhai, nangni mi lo hrietpêk ding ieng am a um a? LALPAIN a kuomah, ‘David chu ṭawngsie inphur rawh,’ a ti si chun inphur el raw se, ‘Iengdinga chuong anga i thaw am a ni leh?’ tuin am ti hlak an ta?” a ta."
11,"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more may this Benjamite now do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.","Chun, David chun Abisai le a siehlawhai po po kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, ka naupa ka rîla ra ngei chun mi that a tum a na, hi Benjamin mi hin a va tum nasa nâwk zuol âwm de! Ieng- khawm law naw unla, ṭawngsie chu inphur el raw se; LALPA inthawtir a ni sih a."
12,"It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.","LALPA chun ka rimsikzie hi hung hmûng a ta. LALPA chun vawi- sûna hienga ṭawngsie a mîn phur hi a ṭha tiengin a mi hung thung el khawm a ni thei a nih,” a ta."
13,"So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.","Chuongchun, David le a mihai chu lampuia chun an fe pei tah a; chun, Simei chu an râla tlâng panga chun a fe ve pei a, a fe malam chun ṭawngsie chu ân phur pei a, lunghai dâmin a dêng a, pilvut dâmin a theh a."
14,"And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.","Chun, lal le a kuoma mi um po pohai chun Aiphim an tlung a, chu- taka chun an châwldam tah a."
15,"And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.","Chun, Absalom le mipui po po, Israel mihai chu Jerusalemah an feh a, chun, a kuomah Ahithophel khawm a ṭhang a."
16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, Long live the king, Long live the king.","Ark mi Husai, David ruolpa chun Absalom kuom a tlung chun, Husai chun Absalom kuomah, “Pa- thienin laltak humhim raw se, Pathienin laltak humhim raw se,” a ta."
17,"And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?","Chun, Absalom chun Husai kuomah, “Hieng ang hi a ni maw i ruol i lunginsiet dân chu? Iengdinga i ruolpa kuoma i fe naw am?” a ta."
18,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.","Chun, Husai chun Absalom kuomah, “Fe naw ning ah, LALPA le hieng mipui le Israelhaiin an ithlang thu thuin um ka ta, a kuomah um lem ka tih."
19,"And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.","Chun, tu rawng am ka bâwl ding a na? Naupa hmaah rawng ka bâwl ding a ni naw am a nih? I pa hmaa rawng ka bâwl ang khan i hmaah bâwl ka tih,” a ta."
20,"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.","Chuongchun, Absalom chun Ahithophel kuoma chun, “Iengtin am ka thaw ding a na, i ngaidân hril ta?” a ta."
21,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.","Chun, Ahithophel chun Absa- lom kuomah, “I pa thaikêm in nghâk- a siea umhai kuoma chun va lût rawh; chun, Israel mi po poin i pain a thîm che ti hrieng an ta, chuong- chun, nanga tienga ṭhang po po- hai kut chu a hung hrât ding a nih,” a ta."
22,So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.,"Chuongchun, Absalom ta ding chun in chungah puon in an zar a; chuongchun, Israel mi po pohai mithmuah a pa thâikêmhai kuoma chun a lût a."
23,"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.","Chuong laia rem a ruot, Ahithophel remruothai chu, Pathien thu ngai anga ngai a ni hlak a, chuong ang bawk chun, Ahithophelin David le Absalom rem a ruotpuihai po po chu ngai a ni hlak."
