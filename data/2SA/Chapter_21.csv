1,"And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.","Chun, David damlai chun a kum bi sirin kum thum ṭâm a tlah a; chun, David chun LALPA chu a rawn a. Chun, LALPA chun, “Thisen insuotu Saula le a sûnghai lei a nih; Gibeon mihai a that el si a,” a ta."
2,"And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);","Chun, lal chun Gibeon mihai chu a ko a, an kuomah, (Gibeon mihai chu Israel thlahai an ni nawh a, Amor mi la um sunhai kha an ni lem a; Israel thlahai chun an chunga chun ṭawng an lo inkhâm tah a; Saula chun Juda thlahai le Israel thlahai ta dinga ṭhahnem a ngai leiin that a tum el hlak a nih)."
3,"and David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?","David chun Gibeon mihai kuoma chun, “Iengam thawpêk ka ti cheu a? LALPA ro chu mal in sâwm theina dingin ieng ang inremna am siempêk ka ti cheu a?” a ta."
4,"And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.","Chun, Gibeon mihai chun a kuomah, “Saula le a sûnghai le kan chungthua hin tangka le rângkachak tieng thu a ni nawh a, Israel mihai lai hin mi sukhlum theina kan nei bawk nawh,” an ta. Chun, ama chun, “In hril ang taphawt chu thawpêk ka ti cheu,” a ta."
5,"And they said unto the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,","Chun, lal kuoma chun, “A mi sukbohmangtu le Israel ram sûng hrim hrima khawm um loa, sukbo- hmang dinga a mi phiertu chu,"
6,"let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give them.","a naupasalhai pasari mi pe la, LALPA mi ruot Saula umna khuo Gibea khuoa chun LALPA hmaah khai kan tih,” an ta. Chun, lal chun, “Pe e â,” a ta."
7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.","Nisienlakhawm, lal chun LALPA kuomah David le Saula naupa Jonathan kâra, an pahni inkâra ṭawng inkhâmna leiin Saula naupa Jonathan naupa Mephiboseth chu a hum a."
8,"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:","Lal chun Aia naunu Rizpain Saula naupasal pahni a neipêk Armoni le Mephiboseth chu a ṭhuoi a; chun, Meholath mi Barzillai naupa Adriel, Saula naunu Mikalin nau- pasal panga a neipêkhai leh;"
9,"and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell all seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.","chun, Gibeon mihai kuta chun ân hlân a, chun, anni chun LALPA hmaah thingah an khai a, chuong- chun, an pasari chun hmunkhatah an thi seng a, bu sîk hun, buṭei sîk hun vêl laiin an sukhlum a."
10,"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.","Chun, Aia naunu Rizpa chun saiip puon a lâk a, bu sîk ṭantira inthawka vâna inthawka tuiin a hung burkhum chena a umna dingin, lungpui chungah ân zar khum a; an chunga sûna chunglêng vatehai fûk le ramsahai um khawm a phal nawh a."
11,"And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.","Chun, Aia naunu Saula thai- kêm Rizpa thilthaw chu David chu an hril a."
12,"And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa;","Chun, David chu a feh a, Philistin mihaiin Gilboaa Saula an that nia Philistin mihaiin Beth-san muol laia an khai inrutu, Jabes- Gilead mihai kuoma inthawkin Saula ru le a naupa Jonathan ruhai chu a lâk a."
13,and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.,"Chutaka Saula ru le a naupa Jonathan ruhai chu a lâk a; chuong- chun, an khaihai ru khawm chu an lâk khâwm a."
14,"And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.","Chun, Saula ru le a naupa Jonathan ruhai chu Benjamin rama Zela khuoa a pa Kis thlânah an phûm a, chun, lal thupêk ang pei chun an thawh a. Chun, chu hnunga chun chu ram chunga chun Pathien a lungâwi tah a."
15,"And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint;","Philistin mihai chun Israel mihai chu an do nâwk a; chun, David chu a mihai le chun an fe thlah a; Philistin mihai chu an zu do a, chun, David chu a hung chau ta hle el a."
16,"and Ishbi-benob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.","Chun, Isbi-benod, mi lien naupasalhai laia mi, a fei rikzie chu dâr Shekel za thum, kâwlhnâm thar pai chun David chu that a tum a."
17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, Zeruia naupa Abisai chun a san a, Philistin mi chu a thawh a, a that tah a. Chun, David mihai chun, “Israelhai khâwnvar hi i sukmit nawna dingin indo dingin kan kuomah suok ve ta dêr naw ti nih,” tiin a chungah ṭawng an inkhâm a."
18,"And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.",Chu hnunga chun Philistin mihai leh Gob khuoah indona a um nâwk a; chutaka chun Husath mi Sibbekai chun mi lien naupasalhai laia mi Saph a that a.
19,"And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.","Chun, Philistin mihai leh Gob khuoah an indo nâwk a; chun, Bethlehem mi Jaare-oregim naupa Elhananin Git mi Goliath a that a, a fei ngul chu puon khâwngtu puon- kawl ang a nih."
20,"And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.","Chun, Gath khuoah indona a um nâwk a, chutaka chun mi insâng- tak el a kut khingtieng khingtienga kutpâr paruk, a ke khingtieng khingtienga kepâr paruk, a rênga sâwmhni le pali nei hi a um a; ama khawm chu mi liena inthawka pieng a nih."
21,"And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, slew him.","Chun, Israel mihai chu a va cho a, David unau Simei naupa Jonathan chun a lo that a."
22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.","Chun, chuong palihai chu Gath khuoa mi liena inthawka pieng an na, chuonghai chu David le a mihai kutah an thih a."
