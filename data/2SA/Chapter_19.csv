1,"And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.","Chuongchun, Joab chu an hril a, “Ngai ta, lal chun Absalom chu a ṭah a, a sûn ie,” an ta."
2,"And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son.","Chuongchun, chu nia an hnena chu mi po po ta dinga sûnna a lo ni ta lem a; “Lal chu a naupa lei chun a lungngai nasa khawp el a,” an ti chu mipui chun chu ni chun an lo hriet ta sih a."
3,"And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.","Chun, mipuihai chu indonaa mi an tlânsieh a, an inzak a, inrûka an fe hmang angin chu ni chun a rûkin khawpuia chun an lût a."
4,"And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!","Chun, lal chun a hmai a hup a, “Aw ka naupa Absalom, Aw Absalom, ka naupa, ka naupa,” tiin lal chu a ṭap a ṭap a."
5,"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;","Chun, Joab chu inah lal kuoma chun a lût a, “I hringna dâm, i nau- pahai le i naunuhai hringna dâm, i nuhmeihai le i thaikêmhai sanhim- tuhai chu vawisûn hin inzaktakin i siem ta hi;"
6,"in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.","nangma hmangaituhai che i theidah a, nangma theidatuhai che chu i hmangai tlata hin. Hotuhai le sipaihai chu i ta dinga iengkhawm ni lo angin vawisûn hin i suklang tah a; Absalom chu dam sienla, keini po po hi vawisûn hin thi ta vawng ni inlang, chu chu i lâwm zâwngtak ni âwmin vawisûn hin ka hriet a nih."
7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.","Chuleiin tho la, suok el rawh, i mihai suklungawi zâwngtakin thu hril rawh, i suok naw chun LALPA sâlin ṭawng kân khâm a nih; mi pakhat khawm vawizân hin i kuoma um um naw ni hai; chun, chu chu i ta dingin i tleirâwla inthawka tu chena i chunga thil ṭha naw hung tlung po pohai nêk hmanin ṭha naw lem a tih,” a ta."
8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.","Chuongchun, lal chu a tho a, kul kawtkhâra chun a ṭhung a; “Ngai ta u, lal chu kul kawtkhâra chun a ṭhung a,” tiin mipui po po chu an hril a; chun, mipui po po chu lal hmaa chun an va fe tah a."
9,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.","Israelhai ruok chu anni puon in sengah an fe tah a. “Lal chun ei hmêlmahai kuta inthawkin a mi sansuok a, Philistin mihai kuta inthawkin a mi sandam tah a; chun, tuhin hi rama inthawk hin Absalom chu a tlân hmangsan a."
10,"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?","Chun, Absalom ei lal dinga hriek ei nâl chu indonaah a thi tah sih a, iengdinga lal chu baukhat bêka a ko kîr zâi in rêl naw am a ni leh?” tiin Israel mi po pohai chu an insêl ta mur mur el a."
11,"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, to bring him to his house.","Chuongchun, lal David chun thiempu Zadok le Abiathar kuoma chun, “Juda upahai kuoma chun, ‘Iengdinga lal chu a in tienga ṭhuoi kîr ding thuah a muongtaka ṭhang am in nih a? Israel mihaiin lal ṭhuoi kîr ding thu an hril chu lal kuom a tlung ta sih a."
12,"Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?","Ka unauhai in na, ka ru le ka tisa in ni sih a, iengdinga a muong- taka ṭhang am in ni leh aw?’ tiin hril ro."
13,"And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.","Chun, Amasa kuomah, ‘Ka ru le ka tisa i ni naw am a nih? Joab aia ka hmaa sipaihai hotua ka siem nawtâk che leh Pathienin a law law mi law el raw se, chu nêka nasa khawmin,’ a tih a, va ti ro,” tiin mi a tir a."
14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent unto the king, saying, Return thou, and all thy servants.","Chuongchun, Judahai po po lungril chu mi pakhat lungril ang elin a sukthle ta duol a; chuongchun, lal kuomah, “I mihai po po le khan hung kîr nâwk ro,” ti dingin mi an tir tah a."
15,"So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.","Chuongchun, lal chu a kîr nâwk a, Jordan a va tlung a. Chun, Judahai chu lal lo tuok a, lal chu Jordan lo ṭhuoikai dingin Gilgala chun an feh a."
16,"And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.","Chun, Bahurim khuoa mi Ben- jamin mi Gera naupa Simei chu in- hmawtakin lal David tuok ding chun Judahai ruolin a hung thla veh a."
17,"And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.","Chun, a kuoma chun Benjamin mi sâng le, Saula sûnghai siehlaw, Ziba, a naupasalhai sâwm le panga le, a siehlaw sâwmhnihai leh an ṭhang ve a; chun, lal mithmua chun Jordan chu an kai a."
18,"And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.","Chun, lal sûnghai ṭhuoikaina ding le ṭha a ti ang anga hmang dingin lawng an fepui a. Chun, Jordan vadung a hei kai chun Gera naupa Simei chu lal hmaa chun a bawkkhup a."
19,"And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.","Chun, lal kuoma chun, “Ka lalpa chun khawhlona neiah mi ruot naw hrâm sienla, lalpa ka puin Jerusalem a suoksan nia i siehlaw hin indik nawtaka a lo thaw tahai kha hre zing bawk naw la, lal chun lungrilah vawn zing naw raw se."
20,"For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.","I siehlaw hin thil ka lo suksuol ti kân hriet a; chuleiin, ngai ta, Josef sûng po pohai laia ka pu lal chu tuok dingin vawisûn hin a hung thla hmasa tak ka hung ni nghe nghe annaw,” a ta."
21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah’s anointed?","Nisienlakhawm, Zeruia naupa Abisai chun a dawn a, “LALPA hriek- nâl chu ṭawngsie ân phur leiin Simei hi sukhlum ding a ni naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
22,"And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?","Chun, David chun, “Nangni Ze- ruia naupasalhai, nangni hin in mi lo hriet pêk ding ieng am a um a? Vawi- sûn hin a mi dotuhai in ni naw am a nih? Vawisûn hin Israel mihai laia mi hrim hrim sukhlum ding am a nih? Vawisûn hi Israel mihai chunga lal ka ni hi ka hriet naw am a nih?” a ta."
23,"And the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.","Chun, lal chun Simei kuoma chun, “Thi naw tawp i tih,” a ta. Chun, lal chun a kuomah ṭawng ân khâm tah a."
24,"And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.","Chun, Saula naupa Mephi- boseth chu lal tuok dingin a hung thlah a; lal a fe suoka râlmuonga a hung kîr nâwk ni chen chun a kehai chu a chei nawh a, a khâkhmul chu a chep ruol bawk nawh a, a puonhai khawm chu a sâwp nawh a."
25,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?","Chun, lal tuok dinga Jerusa- lema a fe chun lal chun a kuomah, “Mephiboseth, iengdinga ka kuoma i fe ve naw am?” a ta."
26,"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.","Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Aw, lalpa ka pu, ka siehlawin a mi hlêm a nih; i siehlaw hin, ‘Lal kuoma ka fena dingin sabengtung chei ka tih,’ ka tih a, i siehlaw hi ka ke ân bâi sih a."
27,And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.,"Chun, lalpa ka pu kuoma hin i siehlaw hi a hêk a, nisienlakhawm, lalpa ka pu chu Pathien vântirko ang a na, chuleiin ṭha i ti ang angin thaw el rawh."
28,For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king?,"Ka pa sûnghai po po chu lalpa ka pu hmaa chun sukhlum vawng âwm an na, nisienlakhawm, i siehlaw hi i buthlêng awtpuituhai lai ân ṭhangtir a. Chuleichun, lal kuoma hin thil dang phût ngam âwm khawm am ka ni ta?” a ta."
29,"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “I chungchâng thu hi iengdinga i hril nâwk hlak am? Nang le Ziba chun ram chu insem ro ka ti a nih,” a ta."
30,"And Mephibosheth said unto the king, yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.","Chun, Mephiboseth chun lal kuomah, “E, amân nei vawng el raw se, lalpa ka pu chu inah râlmuongin a hung tlung ta sih a,” a ta."
31,"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.","Chun, Gilead mi Barzillai chu Rogelim-a inthawkin a hung thlah a, lal chun Jordana ṭhuoikai dingin a kuomah Jordan a kai veh a."
32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.","Barzillai chu upatak a na, kum sâwmriet mi zet a nih; Mahanaima lal um sûng khan fâk ding dâm a lo tumpêk a, mi neinungtak a nih."
33,"And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.","Chun, lal chun Barzillai kuoma chun, “Ka kuoma fe ve la, ka kuomah Jerusalemah châwm ka ti che,” a ta."
34,"And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?","Chun, Barzillai chun lal kuom- ah, “Ieng chen tak am la damin lal kuoma Jerusalema chun hang fe vêng ka ta?"
35,I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?,"Tuhin kum sâwmriet mi ka na, a sie le ṭha khawm thlier thei am ka la nih? I siehlaw hin ka thil fâk le dâwn hi ân hnik naw khawm ka hriet hran thei ta am a nih? Nuhmei le pasal hla sak ri khawm ka hriet hran thei ta am a nih? Chuleiin, i siehlaw hi iengdingin am ka pu ta ding hin phurrik ni el ka ta?"
36,Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?,I siehlaw hin lal kuoma Jordan râl kai ve chau hi ka tum a nih; iengdingin am lal chun chuong ang chun ṭhat man chu mi thung ve kher a ta?
37,"Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.","Lunginsiettakin i siehlaw hi mîn fetir nâwk el la, ka nu le pa thlân umna keini khuo ngeiah thi de ning. Amiruokchu, en ta, i siehlaw Kim- ham hi, lalpa ka pu kuomah fe ve sienla, a chungah ṭha i ti ang angin thaw rawh,” a ta."
38,"And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, “Kim- ham chu ka kuomah fe vêng a tih, ṭha i ti ang peiin a chungah thâwng ka tih; chun, thil iengkhawm i mi hni ta- phawt chu thawpêk pei ka ti che,” a ta."
39,"And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.","Chun, mipui po pohai chu Jordan râl an kai a; chun, lal khawm chu a kai veh a; chun, lal chun Barzil- lai chu a fâwp a, mal a sâwm a; chun, ama hmun tieng a fe nâwk tah a."
40,"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.","Chuongchun, lal chu Gilgala chun a kai a. Kimham chu a kuoma chun a kai ve a; chun, Juda mi po pohai chun lal chu an ṭhuoi kai a; Israel mi khawm a zâtve an ṭhang."
41,"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?","Chun, Israel mi po po chu lal kuomah an hung a, lal kuoma chun, “Iengdinga kan unau Juda mihai hin an chang bîk cheh a, lal le a sûnghai le David mihai po po khawm Jordan râla an ṭhuoi sa vawng el?” an ta."
42,"And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?","Chun, Juda mi po pohai chun Israel mihai chu an dawn a, “Lal chu keini tieng hnai a ni lei a nih, iengdinga hi thua hin in lunginsen el am? Lal nei ringa um am kan nih? Thilpêk ieng amani khawm a mi nei am a nih?” an ta."
43,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.","Chun, Israel mihai chun Juda mihai chu an dawn a, “Lala hin chan sâwm kan nei a, Davida hin nangni nêkin chan kan nei lem a nih. Ieng- dinga in mi ngainêp el am a na? Lal ṭhuoikîr thu hi a rawt hmasatu kan ni naw am a nih?” an ta. Chuongchun, Juda mihai thu chu Israel mihai thu nêk chun ân rum ta lem a."
