1,"And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.","Chun, chu hnunga chun David chun, “Juda ram khâwlai ama- niah ka hang fe ding?” tiin LALPA a rawn a. Chun, LALPA chun a kuomah, “Hang fe raw khai,” a ta. David chun, “Khâwlai am ka hang fe ding?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Hebronah,” a ta."
2,"So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.","Chuongchun, David chu chutaka chun a hang fe tah a, a nuhmeihai pahni Jezreel mi Ahinoam le Kar- mela Nabal nuhmei Abigail le khan."
3,"And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.","Chun, David chun a kuoma mi um po pohai chu a ṭhuoi a, mi tin an sûngkuohai seng leh, Hebron khuoa chun an um a."
4,"And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.","Chun, Juda rama mihai an va feh a, Juda mihai chunga lal dingin David chu hriek an nâl tah a. Chun, “Saula phûmtuhai chu Jabes-gilead mihai an nih,” tiin David chu an hril a."
5,"And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.","Chuongchun, Jabes-gilead mihai kuoma chun David chun mi a tir a, an kuomah, “In lalpa Saula chu hi lung- insietna hi suklangin ama chu in lo phûm ta leiin LALPA chun malsâwm raw se cheu."
6,"And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun in chungah zainêmna le thutak inlang- tir sienla, hieng thil in thaw lei hin kei khawma in lunginsietna man chu thung ka ti cheu."
7,"Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.","Chuongchun, in kuthai chu hung hrât sienla, huoitakin um ro, in lalpa Saula chu a thi ta sih a; chun, Juda chihai chun an chunga lal dingin hriek an mi nâl ta bawk a,” a ta."
8,"Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;","Chun, Nera naupa Abner, Saula sipai hotu chun Saula naupa Is- boseth chu Mahanaimah a ṭhuoi a,"
9,"and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.","Gilead chunga dâm, Asur mihai chunga dâm, Jezreel chunga dâm, Ephraim chunga dâm, Israel chung po poah lalah a siem tah a."
10,"Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.","(Saula naupa Is-boseth chu Israel chunga ro a rêl ṭan lai chun kum sâwmli mi a na, kum hni ro a rêl a). Nisienlakhawm, Juda mihai chun David chu an pawm lem a."
11,And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.,Davidin Hebrona Juda chihai chunga ro a rêlna chu kum sari le thla ruk a ni tah a.
12,"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.","Chun, Nera naupa Abner le Saula naupa Is-boseth siehlawhai chu Mahanaima inthawk an suok a, Gibeonah an feh a."
13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.","Chun, Zeruia naupa Joab le David siehlawhai chu an fe suok a, Gibeon dîla chun an intuok a; chuong- chun, pâwl khat chu dîl râl khing- tieng chun an ṭhung a, pâwl khat dang chu dîl râl khingtieng chun."
14,"And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.","Chun, Abner chun Joab kuom- ah, “Tlangvâlhai chu hung inthawk- hai sienla, ei hmaa hin hang inthaw ta hai sienla,” a ta. Chun, Joab chun, “Hung inthawk e â,” a ta."
15,"Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.","Chuongchun, an inthawk a, an ni zât chin ruot chie chu an kai a, Benjamin chi Saula naupa Is-boseth tienga ṭhang chu sâwm le pahni; chun, David siehlawhai chu sâwm le pahni bawk."
16,"And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.","An khingpuihai chu an lu sengah an inman a, mâni bitumhai chu an nâkah kâwlhnâmin an insun seng a; chuongchun, an tlu ta vawng el a; chuleiin, chu hmun chu Helkath-Hazurim an ti tah a; chu chu Gibeona um a nih."
17,"And the battle was very sore that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.","Chuongchun, chu nia an inthaw chu a nasa ta hle a, chun, Abner le Israel mihai chu David siehlawhai hmaa chun an tlâwm tah a."
18,"And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.","Chun, chutaka chun Zeruia naupasalhai pathum Joab le Abisai le Asahel hai chu an um a, Asahel chu sazukpui ang ela ngal hrât a nih."
19,And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.,"Chuongchun, Asahel chun Abner chu a hnawt a, Abner a hnawt chu changtieng le vawitieng khawm pêt hlek loin a hnawt a."
20,"Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.","Chuongchun, Abner chu a hang nghale a, “Nang i ni maw Asahel?” a hei tih a. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Kei ka nih ie,” a ta."
21,"And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.","Chun, Abner chun, a kuomah, “I changtieng amanih, i vawitieng amani khan pêt la, tlangvâl pakhat kha man la, a râlthuom kha lâkpêk rawh,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, Asahel chun ama a hnawt chu a pêtsan nuom chuong nawh a."
22,"And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?","Chun, Abner chun Asahel kuomah, “Mi pêtsan rawh, iengdingin am sunthlûng ka ti cheh a? I unaupa Joab hmêl ka hmu ngam ding am a nih?” a ti nâwk a."
23,"Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.","Nisienlakhawm, a pêt nuom chuong nawh a, chuleiin, Abner chun a feiṭhut tiengin a phîngah a sun a, a fei chu a hnungtieng a tlang a, chutaka chun a tlu ta tawp a, chu hmuna chun a thi tah a; chun, Asahel a tlûka a thina hmun hung tlung taphawthai chu chutaka chun an ngîr chawt pei a."
24,"But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.","Nisienlakhawm, Joab le Abisai chun Abner chu an hnawt pei a, chun, Gibeon thlalêr lampuia Gia dep Amma tlâng an tlung chun nisa a tla tah a."
25,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.","Chun, Benjamin thlahai chu Abner kuoma chun an pungkhâwm a, pâwl khatah an insiem a, tlâng sîpa chun an va ngîr tah a."
26,"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?","Chuongchun, Abner chun Joab chu a ko a, “Kâwlhnâm hin a vât zing ding am a nih? A tâwp tieng chun la lunginzîngum hlêng a tih ti i hriet naw am a nih? Mipuihai chu ieng chen am an unauhai hnawt kîrsan dinga hril loin i um ding a na?” a ta."
27,"And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.","Chun, Joab chun, “Pathien hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ieng- khawm lo hril naw la chu mipuihai chu zîngkâr khan an fe hmang ta ding a na, an unauhai chu an hnawt naw ding bah,” a ta."
28,"So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.","Chuongchun, Joab chun taw- tawrâwt chu a hei mût a, mipuihai chu an ngîr ta ṭhuop a, Israel mihai chu an hnawt ta nawh a, an thaw nâwk ta nawh a."
29,"And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.","Chuongchun, Abner le a mihai chu chu zân chun zânkhawvârin an feh a, chun, Jordan an kai a, Bithron an fe thleng rak a, Mahanaim an tlung tah a."
30,"And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.","Chun, Joab chu Abner a hnawt chu a kîr tah a; chun, mipuihai po po a hei ko khâwm chun David rawihai sâwmpakuo le Asahel an lo kim ta nawh a."
31,"But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.",David rawihai ruok chun Benjamin mihai le Abner mihai chu za thum le sâwmruk an sukhlum a.
32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.","Chuongchun, Asahel ruong chu an lâk a, Bethlehema a pa thlânah an phûm a. Chun, Joab le a mihai chu zânkhawvârin an feh a, Hebron an tlung chun khuo a var a."
