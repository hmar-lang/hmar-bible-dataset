1,"And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.",David chun Israel mihai laia thlang ṭhieu mi sîng thum ân khâwm nâwk a.
2,"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth above the cherubim.","Chun, David chu a tho a, Juda rama Baala khuoa inthawkin cherub- hai chunga chuong sipaihai LALPA hming an inputtir Pathien bâwm chu zu la dingin a kuoma mi um po pohai le chun an inthawk tah a."
3,"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.","Chun, Pathien bâwm chu taw- lailîr tharah an sieh a, tlânga um Abinadab ina inthawk chun an lâk suok a, Abinadab naupasalhai Uzza le Ahio chun tawlailîr thar chu an khal a."
4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.","Chun, tlânga Abinadab ina inthawk chun, Pathien bâwm pum chun an lâk suok a; Ahio chu Pathien bâwm hma tieng chun a feh a."
5,"And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of instruments made of fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.","Chun, David le Israel mi po pohai chun LALPA hmaah thil inri thei chi hran hran fâr thinga siem le, ṭing- ṭanghai dâm, perkhuonghai dâm, khuongtêhai dâm, tawtawrâwt bi neihai dâm, dârbenthekhai dâm an sut a."
6,"And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.","Chun, Nakon hrizâwl an tlung chun Uzza chun Pathien bâwm chu a hei ban a, a chel a; sebâwng chu a pêm a pêm leiin."
7,And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.,"Chun, LALPA lung chu Uzza chunga chun a sen ta thut a, a thil- thaw indik naw lei chun Pathienin chutaka chun a sukhlum tah a; Pathien bâwm kâwla chun a thi tah a."
8,"And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.","Chun, LALPA chu Uzza chunga a hung ṭuong ta lei chun David chu a lunginsen a, chu hmun chu Perez- uzza ân bûk a; chu chu tu chen hin a la ni ta zing a."
9,"And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?","Chu ni chun David chun LALPA chu a ṭih a, “Iengtin am LALPA bâwm hi ka kuom hung tlung thei a ta aw?” a ta."
10,So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.,"Chuongchun, David chun David khuoa chun LALPA bâwm chu a kuomah a lâk nuom ta nawh a, David chun Git mi Obed-edom ina chun a sie ta lem a."
11,"And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.","Chun, LALPA bâwm chu Git mi Obed-edom ina chun thla thum a um a, chuongchun, Obed-edom le a sûng- hai po po chu LALPAIN mal a sâwm a."
12,"And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.","Chun, lal David chu, “Pathien bâwm leiin Obed-edom sûngkuo le a in le lo po po LALPAIN mal a sâwm a nih,” ti an hril a. Chuongchun, David chun Pathien bâwm chu Obed-edom ina inthawk chun David khuoa chun lâwmtakin a zu lâk tah a."
13,"And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.","Chun, LALPA bâwm zâwntuhai chu pên ruk an fe phingleh se- bâwngchal le ran châwm thâuin an inthâwi a."
14,And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.,"Chun, David chu a theitâwpin LALPA hmaah a lâm a, David chun puonzaiinhmi thiempu zakawsîng a hâk a."
15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.","Chuongchun, David le Israel mi po pohai chun khêk dur dur pum le tawtawrâwt mût ruoi ruoi pumin LALPA bâwm chu an lâk tah a."
16,"And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.","Chun, LALPA bâwm chu David khuoa a lût lai chun Saula naunu Mikal chun tukvera inthawk hin a lo thlîr a; LALPA hmaa David lâm le inchâwm chu a zuk hmuh a, a hmusit lungril tah a."
17,"And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.","Chuongchun, LALPA bâwm chu an lâk lût a, a siena dinga Davidin a zar, puon in sûnga a hmun dinga chun an sie tah a; chun, David chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân le inremna thilinhlân chu LALPA hmaa chun ân hlân a."
18,"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.","Chun, Davidin pumrawhmang thilinhlân le inremna thil inhlânhai ân hlân zo chun, sipaihai LALPA hmingin mipuihai chu mal a sâwm a."
19,"And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.","Chun, mipui po po, Israel mi pumpuihai chu a nuhmei a pasalin mi tin el chu bei hlawm khat le sa tlin khat le grêp ra emṭâwl bâwr khat a sem seng a. Chuongchun, mi po po chu mâni in tieng an fe ta seng a."
20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!","Chuongchun, David chu a sûnghai malsâwm dingin a fe tah a. Chun, Saula naunu Mikal chu David tuok ding chun a hung suok a, “Vawisûna Israel lal chu a va ropui de! Mi hotak inzakna châng hre lo, ruoka um ang elin vawisûn khan a siehlaw nunghâkhai mithmuah ruok- in a um kha teh!” a lo tih a."
21,"And David said unto Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah.","David chun Mikal kuoma chun, “I pa le a sûnghai po po aiah mi thlang a, LALPA mi Israelhai chunga lal dinga mi ruottu LALPA hmaah i sawnnaw, LALPA hmaa chu lâm âwm hrim ka nih."
22,"And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor.","Hieng nêk hmanin inzapui la um ka tih, kei le kei khawm lân sit pei bawk ka ta; amiruokchu, chuong sie- hlaw nunghâkhai i hrilhai chawi- mawi chun um ka tih,” a ta."
23,And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.,"Chuongchun, Saula naunu Mikal chun a thi chenin nau a nei ta nawh a."
