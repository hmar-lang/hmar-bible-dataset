1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.,Zeruia naupa Joab chun lal lungril chu Absalom chungah ân nghat ti a hriet a.
2,"And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:","Chuongchun, Joab chun Tekoa khuoah mi a tir a, chutaka nuhmei var pakhat chu a vân ṭhuoitir a, a kuomah, “Lusûn angin insiem la, lusûnna puon sil la, sahriek khawm innâl loin, nuhmei sâwttak mithi sûn ta angin um rawh;"
3,"and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.","chun, lal kuomah fe la, a kuomah hieng ang hin thu va hril rawh aw,” a ta. Chuongchun, Joab chun thu chu a hril tah a."
4,"And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.","Chun, Tekoa khuoa nuhmei chun lal kuoma thu hril ding chun hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a, a bawkkhup a, “Aw lalpa, mi ṭhangpui rawh,” a ta."
5,"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ieng am a ni leh?” a ta. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Hmeithai ka nih a, ka pasal chu a thi tah a."
6,"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.","Chun, i suoknu hin naupasal pahni ka nei a, an pahni chun loah an insuol a, tukhawm a ṭheltu ding an um si nawh a, a pakhat chun pakhat dang chu a vuok a, a sukhlum tah a."
7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.","Chun, ngai ta, an sûngkuo po po chun i suoknu hi an do hrawn a, ‘A unaupa thattu chu, a unaupa a that leia kan that ve theina dingin mi pe raw khai, chuongchun, rohluotu ding khawm sukbohmang nghâl kan tih,’ an ta; chuongchun, ka meiling la um sun chu sukhlum an ta, ka pasal chu hnuoi chunga hming le thla hrim hrim nei loin a um el ding a nih,” a ta."
8,"And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.","Chun, lal chun nuhmei kuoma chun, “I inah fe ta la, i chungchâng thua chun thu pe el ka ti che,” a ta."
9,"And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.","Chun, Tekoa khuoa nuhmei chun lal kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, ka pu, bawsietna maw chu keia chunga le ka pa sûnghai chungah tla el raw se; chun, lal le lalṭhungpha chun maw chu phur naw raw se,” a ta."
10,"And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.","Chun, lal chun, “Tukhawm i chunga ieng amanih hril taphawt chu ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi la, tâwk nâwk ta naw tawp an ti che,” a ta."
11,"Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.","Ama chun, “Thisen insuotuhai chunga phuba latuhaiin sukbohmang ta lo dingin lal chun LALPA i Pathien chu hre zing raw se aw; chuong naw chun chu ka naupa hi sukbohmang rawi an tih,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, i naupa samzai pakhat khawm hnuoia hin tla naw nih,” a ta."
12,"Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chun, “Ka hni che hi, i suoknu hin lalpa ka pu kuoma hin thu bau khat chau hang hril nâwk raw se,” a ta."
13,"And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.","Ama chun, “Hril ta la,” a ta. Chun, nuhmei chun, “Annawleh, ieng leia Pathien mihai dodâla hienga thaw i tum am a nih a? Hieng thua inthawk hin lal chu thiemnaw chang angin ân lang a nih, lal chun a mi tlân hmang chu a ṭhuoikîr nâwk si naw lei hin."
14,"For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.","Ei thi ngei ngei ding a na; chun, tuisik hnuoia inbaw tahnung rût nâwk thei ta lo ang hi ei na. Pathienin hringna hi a lâk hmang a ni nawh a, a tlân hmang chu amaa inthawka mi hran a ni nawna dingin rem a ruot a ni lem a nih."
15,"Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.","Chuongchun, lalpa, ka pu kuoma hi thu hril dinga ka hung khawm hi mi ka ṭi lei a na, chun, i suoknu chun lal kuoma hin hril phawt ka ta, lal chun a suoknu hnina chu ân hlawtlingtir rawi mawh."
16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.",Lal chun kei le ka naupa hi Pathien ro hluo lo dinga mi sukbo- hmang tumtu kuta inthawkin i suok- nu hi sansuok dingin lo ngaisak i tih ka tih a.
17,"Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee.","Chuongchun, i suoknu ta ding hin, lalpa, ka pu thu chu lung- muongumtak ni sienla, ka hni che a nih, a sie a ṭha lo thlier dingin lalpa ka pu chu Pathien vântirko ang el a ni sih a; chun, LALPA Pathien chu i kuomah um raw se, ka ti a nih,” a ta."
18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, nu- hmei kuoma chun, “Ka îndawn taphawt che chu ka kuomah ieng- khawm ip naw rawh aw,” a ta. Chun, nuhmei chun, “Lalpa ka pu chun hril raw se chu,” a ta."
19,"And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;","Chun, lal chun, “Hieng thua hrim hin Joab hin ṭhangna a nei am?” a ta. Chun, nuhmei chun a dawn a, “Lalpa ka pu, i thlarau hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, lalpa ka pu hin a hril taphawt chu tukhawma vawitienga manih, changtienga manih an fe khêl thei âwm nawh a, i siehlaw Joab chun a mi tir a, hieng thuhai po po hi i suoknu hi a hril vawng a nih;"
20,"to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.","thil umdân sukdanglam dingin i siehlaw Joab chun hieng thil hi a thaw a nih; chun, ka pu chu khawvêla thil um po pohai hre theiin Pathien vântirko ang elin a var a nih,” a ta."
21,"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.","Chun, lal chun Joab kuomah, “Ngai ta, tuhin hi thil hi ka thaw ve tah a, chuleiin, tuhin fe la, tlangvâl Absalom chu va ṭhuoi nâwk raw le,” a ta."
22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king; and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.","Chun, Joab chu hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a, chibai a bûk a, lal chun mal a sâwm a; chun, Joab chun, “Aw lalpa, ka pu chun a siehlaw hnina chu ân hlawtlingtir leiin vawisûn hin i siehlaw hin i mit ka tlung a nih ti ka lo hriet tah a,” a ta."
23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, Joab chu a tho a, Gesura chun a feh a, Absalom chu Jerusalema chun a hung ṭhuoi tah a."
24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.","Chun, lal chun, “Ama in tieng fe sienla, ka hmêl chu hung hmu naw raw se,” a ta. Chuongchun, Absalom chu ama in tieng chun a feh a, lal hmêl chu a hmu ta nawh a."
25,Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.,"Tuhin Israelhai po po lai Absalom ang hrima hmêl ṭhata inpâk kai tukhawm an um nawh a, a ke lêra inthawka a lusîp chenin sawisêlna hrim hrim a um nawh a."
26,"And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.","A lu a vâw chun (kum khat peiah a vâw hlak a, a sam chu a rik êm leiin a vâw hlak a nih) a sam chu a bûk hlak a, lal bûk dâna shekel za hni a tling hlak a nih."
27,"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.","Chun, Absalom chun naupasal pathum le naunuhmei pakhat a nei a, a hming chu Tamar a na, hmêl ṭhatak a nih."
28,And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king’s face.,"Chuongchun, Absalom chu kum hni pumhlûm Jerusalemah a um a, nisienlakhawm, lal hmêl hrim hrim chu a hmu nawh a."
29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.","Chuongchun, Absalom chun lal kuoma tir dingin Joab chu ân chah a; nisienlakhawm, a fe nuom nawh a; chun, ân châ nawn nâwk a, nisien- lakhawm, a fe nuom chuong nawh a."
30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.","Chuongchun, a siehlawhai kuomah, “I aw, Joab lo chu ka lo kâwl a na, buṭei a nei a, va rawpêk vawng ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, Absalom sie- hlawhai chun lo chu an va raw tah a."
31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?","Chuongchun, Joab chu a tho a, Absalom kuomah a ina chun a feh a, a kuomah, “Iengdinga i siehlawhaiin ka lo an raw am?” a ta."
32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.","Absalom chun Joab chu a dawn a, “Ngai ta, ‘Iengdinga Gesura in- thawka hung am ka nih a? Chutaka chun um zing lang ka ta dingin a ṭha lem ding bah,’ tia lal kuoma tir dingin kân cha cheh a, chuleiin, lal hmêl chu mîn hmutir raw khai, chun, bawsiet- na nei ka lo ni chun mi sukhlum el raw se,” a ta."
33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.","Chuongchun, Joab chu lal kuoma chun a feh a, a hril a; chun, Absalom chu a ko a, lal kuomah a feh a; chun, lal hmaa chun hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a; chun, lalin Absalom chu a fâwp tah a."
