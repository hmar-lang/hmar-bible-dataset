Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.","Chun, David chun chu ni chun, “Jebus mihai thawtu taphawt chu tuiluongnaah hang fe hai sienla, David theidatu mitdel le kebai chu that raw hai se,” a ta. Chuongchun, “Mitdel le kebai chu ina chun lût naw nihai,” an ti hlak a."

13,"And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.","Chun, David chun Hebron a suoksan hnungin Jerusalema chun thaikêm le nuhmei a nei belsah a; chuongchun, David chun naupasal- hai le naunuhmeihai a la nei sa ta rawp a."
14,"And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,","Chun, Jerusalema a neihai hming chu hieng hi an nih; Sammua, Sobab, Nathan, Solomon,"

And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.","Chun, David chun, “Philistin mihai thaw dingin kan hang fe ding am a nih? ka kuta hin anni chu pêng i ti?” tiin LALPA a rawn a. LALPA chun David kuoma chun, “Hang fe rawh, Philistin mihai chu i kutah ka pêk ngei ngei ding a nih,” a ta."
20,"And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.","Chuongchun, David chu Baal- perazima chun a feh a, chutaka chun David chun anni chu a hneh a, “LALPAIN ka hmêlmahai chu tuiting inṭhe ang elin ka hmaah a mi sukdarpêk tah,” a ta.

24,"And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.","Chun, thingtheihmi kûng lêra fe ri ṭhup ṭhup ang i hriet pha chun châng rawh, Philistin sipaihai thaw dingin i hmaah LALPA a suok tah tina nîng a tih,” a ta."
25,"And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN thu a pêk angin David chun a thawh a, Philistin mihai chu Gebaa inthawka Gezer chenin a that a."
