1,"And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.","Chun, LALPA chun David kuoma chun Nathan a tir a. A kuoma chun a feh a, “Khaw pakhata hin mi pahni an um a, pakhat chu mi hausa a na, pakhat chu mi pasie a nih."
2,The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;,Mi hausa chun berâm ruol tamtak le ran ruol tamtak a nei a;
3,"but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.","mi pasie ruok khan chu berâmte alâ chiterek pakhat ân châwk, a ivai pakhat bak naw chu iengkhawm a nei nawh a, a kuoma a nauhai le khawsa an na, a thlêng awtpui le a no in- ṭâwmpui, a ângsûnga um, a naunu- hmei ang chiea a ngai a nih."
4,"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.","Chun, mi hausa kuoma chun inzin pakhat hi a va tlung a; chun, a kuoma mikhuol hung tlung chu ama berâm le ran chu that phal loin, mi pasie berâm chu a lâkpêk a, a kuoma hung inzinpa chu a thatpêk a,” a ta."
5,"And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die:","Chuongchun, David chu chu mi chunga chun a lunginsen ta hle el a; Nathan kuoma chun, “LALPA hring- na sâlin ka hril hi, chu thil thawtu chu sukhlum el tlâk a ni chu,"
6,"and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.","chun, hieng ang thil a thaw lei le lunginsietna a nei naw leiin a berâmte chu a lêt liin a thung ding nîng a tih,” a ta."
7,"And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;","Chuongchun, Nathan chun David kuomah, “Chu mi chu nang hi i nih, LALPA, Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih, Israelhai lal ni dingin hriek ka nâl cheh a, Saula kuta inthawkin ka sansuok cheh a;"
8,"and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things.","chun, i pu in ro chu kân hluotir cheh a, i pu nuhmeihai chu i ângsûng- ah ka sieh a, Israel le Juda sûngkuohai ka pêk bawk cheh a, chun, chuong chu tlâwm taluo a ni chun, thil dang khawm ka pêk belsa ding che annâwm."
9,"Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.","Iengtiziea LALPA thu chu ngainêpa, a mithmua thil ṭha naw i thaw el am a ni leh? Hit mi Uria chu kâwlhnâmin i sukhlum a, a nuhmei chu i nuhmei dingin i neipêk a, Ammon thlahai kâwlhnâmin i that a."
10,"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.","Chuleiin, tu hin kâwlhnâm chun i insûng chu inkiensan naw tawp a tih, nang chun mi ngainêpin Hit mi Uria nuhmei chu i nuhmei dingin i lâkpêk ta sih a."
11,"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.","LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘Ngai ta, nangma sûngkuo laia inthawk ngeiin i chungah thil ṭha naw insuoktir ka ta, i mithmu ngeiah i nuhmeihai chu lâkpêk ka ti cheh a, i vênghai pêng ka ta, sûn khawvarah i nuhmeihai chu zâlpui an tih."
12,"For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.","Nang chun chu inrûkin i thawh a, kei ruok chun chu Israel mihai po po mithmuah sûn khawvarah ka thaw ding a nih,’ a tih,” a ta."
13,"And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.","Chun, David chun Nathan kuomah, “LALPA chungah thil ka lo suksuol tah a nih,” a ta. Chun, Nathan chun David kuomah, “LALPA khawma i suol chu a sie hmang ve tah a; thi naw ti nih."
14,"Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.","Amiruokchu, hi i thilthaw hin Pathien hrilsietna remchângtak LALPA hmêlmahai ta dinga i siem leiin naupang nangmaa inthawka pieng chu thi ngei a tih,” a ta."
15,"And Nathan departed unto his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.","Chuongchun, Nathan chun a in tieng a fe san tah a. Chun, Uria nuhmei David a neipêk naupang chunga chun LALPA chun a kut a thlâk a, a na ta hle el a."
16,"David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.","David chun naupang ta ding chun Pathien kuomah a ngên rak a; chun, David chun bu dâm a nghei a, a lût a, zân khawvârin hnuoiah a zâl tah a."
17,"And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.","Chun, a sûnghai laia upahai chu an tho a, hnuoia inthawka keitho ding chun a kâwlah an ngîr a; nisien- lakhawm, a tho nuom nawh a, an kuoma khawm bu khawm a fâk bawk nawh."
18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!","Chun, hieng hi a hung na, ni sari ni chun naupang chu a thi tah a. Chun, David siehlawhai chun naupang chu a thi tah ti hril chu an ṭih a, “Ngai ta u, naupang a dam lai khan a kuomah thu ei hril a, ei râwl a ngai si nawh a, naupang chu a thi tah ti iengtin am hril ngam tâng ei ti leh, ieng amanih inlaw el rawi a tih,” an ta."
19,"But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.","Nisienlakhawm, David chun chuonga siehlawhai chu an inbiekrûk a hmu chun David chun naupang chu a thi a nih ti a hriet tah a; chun, David chun a siehlawhai kuomah, “Nau- pang chu a thi tah a ni maw?” a ta. Chun, anni chun, “A thi tah,” an ta."
20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.","Chuongchun, David chu hnuoia inthawk chu a tho a, ân sâwp a, sahriek ân nâl a, a puonhai ân thleng a; chun, LALPA inah a feh a; Pathien chibai a bûk a; chun, a in tieng chun a fe nâwk a; chun, bu a hei lam a, a hmaa chun an hung sieh a, a fâk tah a."
21,"Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.","Chun, a siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “I thil thawzie hi iengtizie am a ni a? Naupang chu a dam lai khan bu dâm i nghei a, i ṭap a; nisien- lakhawm, naupang chu a thi tah a, i tho a, bu dâm i fâk ta lem a,” an ta."
22,"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?","Chun, ama chun, “Naupang kha a la dam lai khan bu dâm ka ngheiin ka ṭap luoh a, ‘Naupang chu a dam theina dingin LALPA chun a mi lung- insiet rawi mawh, tuin am hrieng ei ta?’ ka ti a na."
23,"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu a thi ta sih a, iengdingin am bu nghei tâng ka ta? Ka ko kîr nâwk thei ding am a nih? A kuomah keima hi la fêng ka ta, nisienlakhawm, ama chu ka kuomah hung kîr nâwk ta naw ni,” a ta."
24,"And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;","Chuongchun, David chun a nuhmei Bathseba chu a thlamuon a, a kuomah a lût a, a zâlpui a, chun, naupasal a nei a, a hminga chun Solomon a sak a. Chun, ama chu LALPAIN a hmangai a;"
25,"and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah’s sake.","chun, zâwlnei Nathan chu thu ân chawitir a; chun, ama chun LALPA hming chawiin a hminga chun Jedi- dia a sak a."
26,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.","Chun, Joab chun Ammon thla- hai khawpui Rabba a rûn a, khawpui chu a lâk a."
27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.","Chun, Joab chun David kuomah mi a tir a, “Rabba chu ka rûn a; anih, tuihai khawpui chu ka lâk tah an- naw."
28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.","Chuongchun, mi la umhai po po chu ko khâwm la, khawpui chu do tumin ep la, la rawh, keiin khawpui chu ka lâk chun chu ka hming put el rawi a tih,” a ta."
29,"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.","Chuongchun, David chun mi po pohai chu a ko khâwm a, Rabbaa chun an feh a, an va rûn a, an lâk tah a."
30,"And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.","Chun, an lal lallukhum khum lai chu a lâkpêk a, a rikzie chu rângkachak talent bûk a na, lung- hluhai khawm a ṭhang a; chun, David chu an inkhumtir a. Chun, khawpuia inthawk chun râllâk sum tamtak a lâk a."
31,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.","Chun, mipuihai chu a kei suok a, thingâtnahai dâm, hnuoi inletna thîrzumhai dâm, thîr hreipuihai dâm hmangin sin an inthawtir a; hnuoi rawchang dâm an insiemtir a. Ammon thlahai khawpuihai po po chu chuong ang chun a thawh a. Chun, David le mi po po chu Jerusa- lema chun an fe nâwk tah a."
