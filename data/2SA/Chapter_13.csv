1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.","Chun, David naupa Absalom chun farnu hmêl ṭhatak a nei a, a hming chu Tamar a nih. Chun, David naupa Amnon chun ama chu a hmangai a."
2,And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything unto her.,"Chuongchun, Amnon chu a farnu Tamar lei chun a buoi ta hle el a, a damnaw tah a; ama hlak chu nu- nghâk inthieng a ni sih a; a chunga thil ieng amani hang thaw chu Amnon ta ding chun khirtak a nih."
3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.","Amiruokchu, Amnon chun ruol a nei a, a hming chu Jonadab a na, David unaupa Simea naupa a nih; Jonadab chu mi var vervêktak a nih."
4,"And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.","Chun, a kuomah, “Aw, nang lal naupa hi a ni têla iengtiziea chêr tel tel am i nih a? I mi hril nuom naw ding am a nih?” a ta. Chun, Amnonin a kuomah, “Ka unaupa Absalom farnu Tamar hi ka hmangai tlat el a nih,” a ta."
5,"And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.","Chun, Jonadab chun a kuomah, “I khumah zâl zing la, damnaw tehlêm thaw la, chun, i pain a hung en pha che a kuomah, ‘Ka hni che a nih, ka farnu Tamar kha ka kuomah hung sienla, bei fâk ding mi hung pe sienla; chun, ka hmu theiah, ka mit- hmu ngeiah fâk ding mi buotsaipêk raw se; a kuta inthawk ngeiin lo fâng ka tih,’ lo ti raw khai,” a ta."
6,"So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.","Chuongchun, Amnon chu a zâl a, a damnaw tehlêm tah a; chun, lalin a va en chun Amnon chun lal kuomah, “Ka hni che a nih, ka farnu Tamar kha hung sienla, ka mithmu ngeia hin beiphêk pahni mi siempêk sienla, ama kuta inthawk ngei chun lo fâng ka tih,” a ta."
7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food.","Chuongchun, David chun Tamar kuoma chun, “I ṭapa Amnon in tieng fe la, fâk ding va siempêk raw khai,” tiin a inah mi a tir a."
8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.","Chuongchun, Tamar chu a ṭapa Amnon in tieng chun a feh a; ama chu a lo zâl zing a. Chun, beihlawm chu a lâk a, a hmet a, a mithmuah beiphêk chu a siem a, beiphêkhai chu a em tah a."
9,"And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.","Chun, a emna chu a lâk a, a hmaa chun a bun a; nisienlakhawm, a fâk nuom nawh a. Chun, Amnon chun, “Mi po pohai hin mi suoksan vawng raw hai se,” a ta. Chuongchun, ama chu an suoksan ta vawng a."
10,"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.","Chun, Amnon chun Tamar kuoma chun, “I kuta inthawk ngeia ka fâk theina dingin fâk ding chu pindana hin hung la ta raw le,” a ta. Chun, Tamar chun a beiphêk siemhai chu a lâk a, a ṭapa Amnon kuomah pindana chun a lâk lût a."
11,"And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.","Infâktir dinga a kâwl hnaia a va fe chun a lo man a, a kuomah, “Ka farnu, hung ta zâl ei tih,” a ta."
12,"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.","Ama chun a dawn a, “Ni lo ve, ka ṭapa, mi thawlui naw rawh, Israelhai lai hin hieng ang thil hi thaw ding a ni nawh ie, hi thil suol invêtthlâktak hi thaw naw raw khai."
13,"And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.","Chun, keiin ka muolphona chu khâwlai am fepui ka ta? Chun, nang khawm Israelhai lai hin mi invêta ngai i ni el ding i sawnnaw. Chuleiin, lal be lem raw khai, i mi nei chu sêl chuong naw nih,” a ta."
14,"Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.","Nisienlakhawm, a râwl chu a ngai nawh a, ama nêkin a hrât lem sih a, a thawlui a, a zâlpui tah a."
15,"Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.","Chuongchun, Amnon chun theida namênin a theida nâwk ta si nawh a, a theidana chu ama a hma- ngai laia a hmangaina nêka nasa lemin a nih a theida chu. Chuong- chun, Amnon chun a kuomah, “Tho la, fe hmang dai rawh,” a ta."
16,"And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Chuong ang ding chu a ni nawh, hienga indiknawtaka i mi tirhmang hi ka chunga i thil thaw ta nêk hman khan a ṭha naw lem a nih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a ngai chuong nawh a."
17,"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.","Chuongchun, a rawngbâwltu a siehlaw chu a ko a, “Hi nuhmei hi ka kuoma inthawkin insuoktir la, kawt kal tlat rawh,” a tih a."
18,"And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.","Zakawfuol ze tum tuma ṭiel a hâk a, chuong ang zakawfuol chu lal nunghâk inthienghai chun an hâk hlak a. Chuongchun, a siehlaw chun a ṭhuoi suok a, kawt a kal ta tlat a."
19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.","Chun, Tamar chun a lua chun vut a phul a, zakawfuol ze tum tuma ṭiel a hâk chu a keithlêr a, a lusîpah a kut a sui a, inringtaka ṭap malam peiin a fe tah a."
20,"And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.","Chun, a ṭapa Absalom chun a kuomah, “I ṭapa Amnon chu i kuomah a hung lût a ni maw? nisienlakhawm, to el rawh, ka farnu, ama chu i ṭapa a ni annâwm, engto nuom naw rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, Tamar chu a ṭapa Absalom ina chun ngûitakin ân khum ta tlat el a."
21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.","Nisienlakhawm, lal Davidin chuong thil po po a hung hriet chun a lunginsen hle el tah a."
22,"And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.","Chun, Absalom chun Amnon kuoma chun a sie a ṭha, iengkhawm a hril nuom nawh a; Absalom chun a farnu Tamar chu a lo thawlui lei chun Amnon chu a theida hle a nih."
23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.","Chun, kum hni pumhlûm a bo hnung chun Ephraim kâwla Baal- hazora chun Absalom chun berâm hmul ân vâwtir a; Absalom chun lal naupahai po po chu a fiel a."
24,"And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.","Chun, Absalom chu lal kuoma chun a feh a, “Ngai ta, i siehlaw chun berâm hmul ân vâwtir a, lal le a siehlawhai chu a siehlaw kuoma hin fe ve hai sienla,” a ta."
25,"And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.","Chun, lal chun Absalom kuomah, “Ni lo e, ka naupa, kan rêng chun fe naw ning ung, sukkhaw taluo rawi kan ti che,” a ta. Ama chun a fiel a fiel a, amiruokchu, a fe nuom chuong nawh a, mal ruok chu a sâwm a."
26,"Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?","Chuongchun, Absalom chun, “Annawleh, ka hni che hi, ka unaupa Amnon bêk kan kuomah hung raw se,” a ta. Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Iengdingin am fe bîk a ta?” a ta."
27,"But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.","Nisienlakhawm, Absalom chun Amnon le lal naupahai chu an rênga a kuoma fe ve dingin a ngênpêk ṭâl a."
28,"And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.","Chun, Absalom chun a sie- hlawhai chu, “Ngai ta, Amnon chu uoin dâwna a hlim laiin in kuomah, ‘Amnon kha that ro,’ ka ti cheu chun that unla, ṭi naw ro, thu ka pêk ta cheu annâwm; insukhuoi unla, insukpasal ṭha unla,” tiin thu a pêk a."
29,"And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.","Chuongchun, Absalom siehlaw- hai chun Amnon chunga Absalom thupêk ang chun an thawh a. Chuongchun, lal naupahai po po chu an tho a, an sabengtung lien chi chungah an chuong seng a, an tlân hmang tah a."
30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.","Chun, lampui kâra an la um laiin, “Absalomin lal naupahai po po a that ta vawng el a, pakhat khawm hla a nei nawh,” tiin David kuoma chun chanchin a hung tlung a."
31,"Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.","Chuongchun, lal chu a tho a, a silfênhai a keithlêr a, hnuoiah a zâl tah a; chun, a siehlawhai po po chu an silfênhai keithlêrin a kâwla chun an ngîr a."
32,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.","Chun, David unaupa Simea naupa Jonadab chun a dawn a, “Ka pu hin lal naupasal tlangvâlhai po po chu an that vawng ti ring naw raw se, Amnon chau a thi a nih; a farnu Tamar a thawlui chena khan Absalom chun hieng anga thaw hi a tum hrim a nih."
33,"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.","Chuleiin, ka pu lal chun lal naupahai po po an thi amanih ti ringin, lung inhângpui naw raw se, Amnon chau a thi a nih,” a ta."
34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.","Absalom ruok chu a tlânhmang tah a. Chun, a râl vêngtu tlangvâl chun a mit a hang inlên a, a hang en a; chun, ngai ta, a hnungtienga tlâng panga lampuia chun mi tamtak an hung a."
35,"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.","Chun, Jonadab chun lal kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, lal naupahai chu an hung ie, i siehlawin a hril ang chie kha a ni ngei el,” a ta."
36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.","Chun, a hril zo phingle chun, ngai ta, lal naupahai chu an hung tlung a, an râwl insuo meuin an ṭap a; chun, lal khawm chu a siehlawhai le chun an ṭap ta rak rak el a."
37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.","Absalom ruok chu a tlânhmang a; Gesur lal Ammihur naupa Talmai kuomah a feh a. Chun, David chun ni tin hin a naupa chu a sûn hlak."
38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.","Chuongchun, Absalom chu a tlânhmang a, Gesur rama chun a feh a, chutaka chun kum thum a va um a."
39,"And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.","Lal David chun Absalom kuoma fe chu ân hâwk êm êm a. Amnon chungchâng thua chun a thlamuong tah a, ama chu a thi ta sih a."
