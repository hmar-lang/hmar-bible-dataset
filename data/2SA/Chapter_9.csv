1,"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?","Chun, David chun, “Jonathan leia lunginsietna kân langtir theina dingin Saula sûnghai laia mi um an la um am aw?” a ta."
2,"And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.","Chun, Saula sûnghai siehlaw pakhat a hming Ziba a um a, David kuoma fe dingin an ko a; chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ziba i ni maw?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Ni e, kei i sie- hlawpa hi,” a ta."
3,"And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet.","Chun, lal chun, “Pathien lungin- sietna ka suklang theina dingin Saula sûnghai laia mi an la um naw am a nih?” a ta. Chun, Ziba chun, “Jonathan chun naupasal pakhat a la nei a, a kehai khawm ân bai nghe ngheh a,” a ta."
4,"And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ama chu khaw lai am a um a?” a ta. Chun, Ziba chun lal kuomah, “Lo-debarah, Ammiel naupa Makir inah a um,” a ta."
5,"Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.","Chuongchun, lal David chun mi a tir a, Lo-debara inthawk, Ammiel naupa Makir ina mi chu an va ṭhuoi a."
6,"And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant!","Chun, Saula nau Jonathan nau- pa Mephiboseth chu David kuoma chun a hung a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a. Chun, David chun, “Mephiboseth,” a ta. Ama chun, “En ta, i siehlaw hi,” a tih a, a dawn a."
7,"And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh, i pa Jonathan zârah lunginsiet ngei ngei ka ti cheh a, i pu Saula ram po po inneitir nâwk ka ti cheh a; chun, ka dawkânah buthlêng awt ve rawp ta hlak i tih,” a ta."
8,"And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?","Chun, chibai a bûk a, “Kei, ui thitlaw ang el, i siehlaw hi ieng am a nia i ngaisak a ni leh?” a ta."
9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master’s son.","Chuongchun, lal chun Saula siehlaw Ziba chu a ko a, a kuomah, “Saula thil po po le, a sûnghai thilhai po po chu i pu naupa hi ka pêk vawng a nih."
10,"And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.","Chun, a ta dingin hnuoi inlet- pêk i ta, nang le i naupasalhai le i siehlawhai leh; chun, i pu naupa chun fâk dinghai a nei theina dingin i thawsuokhai chu hung lâng i ta, i pu naupa Mephiboseth ruok hin chu ka dawkânah buthlêng awt rawp a tih,” a ta. Ziba chun naupasal sâwmpanga le siehlaw sâwmhni a nei a."
11,"Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.","Chuongchun, Ziba chun lal kuomah, “Lal ka puin a siehlaw kuoma thu a pêk ang po po hin i siehlaw hin thâwng a tih,” a ta. Lal chun, “Mephiboseth chun chu ka dawkânah lal naupa ang bawkin buthlêng awt vêng a tih,” a ta."
12,"And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.","Mephiboseth chun naupasal naupang hi a nei a, a hming chu Mika a nih. Chun, Ziba ina um po pohai chu Mephiboseth siehlawhai an na."
13,So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king’s table. And he was lame in both his feet.,"Chuongchun, Mephiboseth chu Jerusalema chun a um tah a, lal dawkâna chun buthlêng a awt ve rawp ta sih a; a ke chu khinghnia inbai a nih."
