1,"And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.","Chun, chutaka chun Benjamin mi, Bikri naupa a hming Seba, Belial mi pakhat a lo um hlau el a; tawtawrâwt a mût a, “Davida hin chanvo ei nei ve nawh a, Jesai naupaa hin rohluo ding ei nei bawk nawh, aw Israel mihai, in puon in tieng seng fe ro,” a ta."
2,"So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, Israel mi po poin David an zui chu an mâksan a, Bikri naupa Seba chu an zui tah a; Juda mihai ruok chun Jordana inthawka Jerusalem chenin an lal chu an inkawppui ta tlat a."
3,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.","Chuongchun, David chun Jeru- salema a in chu a tlung a; chun, lal chun nuhmei sâwm a thaikêmhai in nghâk dinga a siehai chu a ṭhuoi a, a khum a, an fâk ding a pêk a, nisien- lakhawm, an kuomah a lût nawh a. Chuongchun, an thi ni chena khuma umin, hmeithaiin an um tah a."
4,"Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.","Chun, lal chun Amasa kuomah, “Ni thum sûngin Juda mihai mi ko khâwmpêk la, chun, nang khawm hung ṭhang ve bawk la,” a ta."
5,So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.,"Chuongchun, Amasa chu Juda mihai ko khâwm dingin a fe tah a; amiruokchu, a hun ruotpêk nêkin a va thang sâwt tah a."
6,"And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.","Chuongchun, David chun Abisai kuomah, “Bikri naupa Seba hin Absalom nêk hmanin ei pawi a tâwk ding a nih ie, i pu mihai hi ṭhuoi la, hnawt ro khai; chuong naw chun khaw kul neia dam lût hman a ta, ei hmu phâk nawa hin insuo hlau rawi ei tih,” a ta."
7,"And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.","Chuongchun, Joab rawihai, Kereth mihai le, Peleth mihai le an mi hrâthai po po chun ama an zui suok tah a; Jerusalema inthawk chun Bikri naupa Seba chu hnawt dingin an suok tah a."
8,"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.","Gibeona lungpui umna an va tlung chun Amasa chun anni chu a lo tuok a. Chun, Joab chu indona thuomhnawin ân chei a; chun, a chunga chun kâwlhnâm a bâwm pumin, kâwngkhia chun a pai a; chun, a fe malam chun a kâwlhnâm chu damtein a phawi a."
9,"And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.","Chun, Joab chun Amasa kuoma chun, “Unaupa, i ṭha pei de maw?” a ta. Chun, Joab chun Amasa chu fâwp tumin a khâkhmul chu a kut changtiengin a chel a."
10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.","Nisienlakhawm, Amasa chun Joabin kâwlhnâm a chawi chu a ngai- sak nawh a; chuongchun, a phînga chun a sun a, a rîlhai chu a sukthlâk nuoi el a, a sun nawn nâwk ta nawh a; chuongchun, a thi tah a. Chuong- chun, Joab le a unaupa Abisai chun Bikri naupa Seba chu an hnawt tah a."
11,"And there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.","Chun, a kâwlah Joab rawihai laia tlangvâl pakhat chu a ngir a, “Joab le David tienga ṭhang taphawt chun Joab hi zui pei raw se,” a tih a."
12,"And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.","Chun, Amasa chu lamlien laitakah a thisenin a lo inchie nuoi el a. Chun, ama chun mi po po ngîr zinga a hmu chun Amasa ruong chu lamliena inthawk chun phûl tienga sawnin puonin ân khum a, a kâwla hung taphawt chu an ngîr peia a hmu leiin."
13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.","Chun, lamliena inthawka sie hmang a ni hnung chun Bikri naupa Seba chu hnawt dingin mi po po chun Joab chu an zui tah a."
14,"And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.","Chun, Abel chen le, Beth-maaka chenin Israel hnam po pohai le Ber mihai po po khawm chu a sir vawng a; chun, an pungkhâwm a, ama an zui ve a."
15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.","Chun, Beth-maakaa Abel khuoa chun an inhuol a; chun, a khaw hrûla chun hnuoi an dêng pâwng a, kul hrûla chun a ngîr a, chun, Joab kuoma mi um po pohai chun kul chu sukchim dingin an suk tlut tlut a."
16,"Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.","Chuongchun, nuhmei var pa- khat khuoa inthawk chun a hung khêk a, “Khai khai, Joab kuomah, ‘Hung hnâi raw khai, i kuomah thu lo hril ka ti khai,’ a tih, hang ti ro khai,” a tih a."
17,"And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.","Chun, a kuoma chun a va fe hnai a, chun, nuhmei chun, “Joab i ni maw?” a tih a. “Nih e,” a tih a, a dawn a. Chuongchun, a kuomah, “I suoknu thuhril hi ngai ta,” a tih a. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Ka lo ngai ie,” a tih a."
18,"Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.","Chuongchun, “Tienlai chun, ‘Abel khuoa hin inrawn phawt an ta,’ an ti hlak a, chuong ang chun thu an suktâwp hlak."
19,I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?,"Kei hi Israelhai laia inrem nuom le ringum pâwl ka na, nang chun Israel khuo, a khaw bulpui hi suksiet i tum a ni hi, LALPA ro chu iengdinga sukhmang i tum am a na?” tiin a hril a."
20,"And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.","Chun, Joab chun a dawn a, “Chuong ang chu a ni naw tawp el, sukhmang amanih, suksiet amanih ka tum naw hrim hrim. Chuong ang tieng thu chu a ni nawh;"
21,"The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.","Ephraim tlâng rama Bikri naupa Seba chun lal David ngei chu dodâlin a kut ân let a; ama chu mi pe el unla, khuo chu suoksan el kan tih,” a tih a. Chun, nuhmei chun Joab kuomah, “Ngai ta, a lu chu kulah hung pei liempêk kan ti che,” a tih a."
22,"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chu a varna hmang chun mipui po pohai lai chun a feh a. Chun, Bikri naupa Seba lu chu an tan a, Joab kuom tieng chun an thedawk a. Chun, tawtawrâwt a mût a, mâni puon in tieng seng, khuoa inthawk chun an indar tah a. Chun, Joab chu Jerusalemah lal kuoma chun a fe nâwk tah a."
23,Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;,"Joab chu Israelhai po po sipai hotu a na, chun, Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu Kereth mi le Peleth mihai hotu a nih;"
24,and Adoram was over the men subject to taskwork; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;,"chun, Adoniram chu sinthawa ruoiluihai hotu a nih; chun, Ahilud naupa, Jehosaphat chu chanchin ziektu a na;"
25,and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;,"Seva chu lekha ziektu a na, chun, Zadok le Abiathar chu thiempu an nih;"
26,and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister unto David.,"chun, Jair mi Ira khawm chu David thiempu a nih."
