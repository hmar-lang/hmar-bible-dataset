verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye do walk,—that ye abound more and more.","Chuongchun, unauhai, a tâwp taka chun, in um dân ding le Pathien in suklâwm dân ding (tuta in um dân hi) kan kuoma inthawka in lâk ang khan in hau nâwk zuolna dingin Lalpa Isua chun kan ngênin kan infui cheu a nih."
2,For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.,Lalpa Isu zâra chun ieng thuhai am kan pêk cheu kha in hriet sih a.
3,"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;","Pathien dit zâwng, in inthiengna ding chu, hi hi a nih, indit bânsan unla;"
4,"that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,",inthieng le chawimawiin mâni bêl vawng thiem seng ro.
5,"not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God;",Pathien hre naw Jentailhai anga hur kawnga châk loin;
6,"that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.","chu kawnga chun tûkhawmin bawsein, a unau chungah thil ṭha naw chu thaw naw sien la, Lalpa chu chuong ang thil thawtuhai po po phuba latu a ni leiin–keini khawmin kan hril lâwkin kan inhriettir ta cheu ang khan."
7,"For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.","Pathienin inthieng naw dingin a mi ko si nawh a, inthieng dingin a mi ko lem a nih."
8,"Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.","Chuleiin, a pawisa nawtu chu mihriem pawisa naw a ni nawh a, Pathien, a Thlarau Inthieng pe hlaktu cheu kha pawisa naw a ni lem."
9,But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;,"Amiruokchu, unauhai, hmangai kawng thu chu ziek pêk cheu in ngai nawh, inhmangai tuo dingin nangni ngei Pathien inchûktirin in um sih a."
10,"for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more;","Makedonia ram pumpuia unau umhai po po chunga chun chu chu in thaw ngei bawk a nih: nisien- lakhawm, unauhai, thaw nâwkzuol deu deu dingin kan infui cheu a nih."
11,"and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;","Kan hril ta cheu ang khan dei dapa um a, mâni sin seng ngaisak a, mâni kut ngeia sin thaw tum tlat ro."
12,"that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.","Chuongchun, puo tienga mihai chungah mawitakin um thei in ta, iengkhawm tlasam naw ti niu."
13,"But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no hope.","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, mi dang beiseina hrim nei nawhai anga in lungngai nâwna dingin, a inhai chanchin in hriet naw kan nuom nawh."
14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.","Isu a thih a, a tho nâwk tah ti ei ring si chun, Isua intahai chu Pathienin ama ruolin hung ṭhuoi sa ngei a tih."
15,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.","Hi hi Lalpa thuin in kuomah kan hril a nih; eini Lalpa hung pha chena dama lo la um zinghai hin, a in tahai chu lekhal naw tawp ei tih, ti hi."
16,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;","Lalpa ngei chu khêkri leh, vântirko chunghnungtak râwl leh, Pathien tawtawrâwt ri leh, vâna inthawkin a hung ṭum ding a ni sih a; chun, Kristaa thi tahai chu tho hmasâng an tih."
17,"then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.","Chu hnunga chun eini dama lo la um zinghai hi boruokah Lalpa tuok dingin annihai ruolin sûm laiahai khin zuk lâkin um ei tih; chuongchun, Lalpa kuomah kumkhuoin um tâng ei tih."
18,Wherefore comfort one another with these words.,"Chuleiin, hieng thu hin inthla- muon tuo ro."
