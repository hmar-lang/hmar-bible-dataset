verse_no,en,hmr
1,"But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.","Amiruokchu, unauhai, a hun le a ni kawng thu hrim ziekpêk in ngai nawh a."
2,For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.,Lalpa Ni chu zâna inru angin a hung tlung ding a nih ti nangni ngeiin chiengtakin in hriet sih a.
3,"When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.","“Muongna le himna,” tia an hril lai takin, nuhmei nauhase angin kârloin an chungah bohmangna hung tlung a tih, pumpel naw tawp an tih."
4,"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, nang- ni ruok chu, chu Ni chun inru anga a nangna ding cheuin inthimah in um nawh."
5,"for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;","Var nauhai le Ni nauhai in ni vawng sih a, zâna mi ei ni nawh a, inthima mi ei ni bawk nawh."
6,"so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.","Chuleichun, mi danghai angin in ta nâwng ei tiu khai! Meng ei tiu a, fîmkhurin ngaiven lem ei tiu."
7,For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.,"A inhai chu zânah a nih an in hlak chu, zu inruihai khawm zânah a nih an inrui hlak chu."
8,"But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.","Nisienlakhawm, eini chu nia mi ei ni lei hin, ringna le hmangaina âwmphaw chu hâkin, sandamna beiseina chu lukhuma hmangin ngaiven lem ei tiu."
9,"For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,","Pathienin lunginsenna tuor ding ni loin, ei Lalpa Isu Krista zâra sandamna hmu ding lema a mi ruot a ni sih a."
10,"who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.","Ei meng khawma, ei in khawm- a, ama leh ei hring kawp theina dingin ama chu ei thi aiin a thi a nih."
11,"Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.","Chuleiin, infui tuoin insukṭha- hnem tuo seng ro, in thaw hrim hlak ang khan."
12,"But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, kan ngên cheu a nih: nangni laia sin inrim le Lalpaa in hotua um le, a kâwktuhai cheu chu hre ding le,"
13,and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.,an sinthaw leia hmangaia ngaihlu bêk bêk dingin. Inremin um ro.
14,"And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.","Chun, unauhai, kan ngên cheu, dân ang nawa umhai chu kâwk unla, lungril chînhai chu infui unla, a hrât nawhai chu ṭhangpui unla, mi po po chungah dâwthei takin um ro."
15,"See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.","Tûkhawmin tu suol khawm suola thung lo dingin fîmkhur ro; thil in inthawpêk tuona tieng le, mi po po chunga in thawpêkna tienga khawm a ṭha taphawt chu hnawt lem rawp ro."
16,Rejoice always;,"Lâwm rawp unla,"
17,pray without ceasing;,"ma loin ṭawngṭai unla,"
18,in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.,iengkimah lâwmthu hril rawp ro; chu chu nangni tieng thuah Krista Isua chun Pathien dit zâwng a ni sih a.
19,Quench not the Spirit;,Thlarau chu sukmit naw ro.
20,despise not prophesyings;,Thu hrilhai hmusit naw ro;
21,prove all things; hold fast that which is good;,"iengkim infie lem unla, a ṭha ṭha chu pawm tlat ro."
22,abstain from every form of evil.,Suol anga inlang po poa inthawk chun insiekieng ro.
23,"And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Chun, inremna Pathien ngei chun, in pumin sukthieng raw se cheu; chun, in thlarau le, in lungril le in taksa chu ei Lalpa Isu Krista a hung pha chun, sawisêlboa a puma humhimin um raw se."
24,"Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.","A kotu cheu chu ring a um a, thaw khawm thaw ngei bawk a tih."
25,"Brethren, pray for us.","Unauhai, mi ṭawngṭaipêk ro."
26,Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.,Unau po pohai kha fâwp inthiengin chibai mi bûkpêk ro.
27,I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.,Hi lekha hi unau po po kuoma chun tiem dingin Lalpa hmingin ka phût cheu.
28,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.,Ei Lalpa Isu Krista lungin- sietna chu in kuomah um raw se.
