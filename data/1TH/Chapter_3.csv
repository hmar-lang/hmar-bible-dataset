1,"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;","Chuongchun, kan tuor zo ta naw tika chun Atheniah keini chau mâksanin um inlang ṭha kan tih a."
2,"and sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;","Timothe ei unaupa, Krista Chan- chin Ṭha tienga Pathien rawngbâwl- tu hi sukdet ding cheu le in ringna kawnga thlamuon ding cheuin kan hung tir a nih;"
3,that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.,hieng rinum tuorna lei hin tûkhawm an inhnîng nawna dingin; hienghai hi tuor dinga ruot kan nih ti nangni ngeiin in hriet sih a.
4,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know.","In kuoma kan um lai khan rinum tuor ding kan nih ti kan hril lâwk ngei cheu kha; chuong ang ngei chun a hung tlung tah a, chu chu in hriet kha."
5,"For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.","Chuleichun, ka tuor zo ta naw phingleh, thlêmtu chun thlêm thlu hlau rawi a ti cheu a, kan sin inrimna chu thlâwn rawi a tih, tiin in ringzie ka lo hriet theina dingin mi ka hung tir a nih."
6,"But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also to see you;","Nisienlakhawm, Timothe chu in kuoma inthawka tuta kan kuoma a hung tlung hin, hmu cheu kan inhâwk ang bawkin, mi hmu inhâwk bêk bêkin ngainatakin in mi hriet zing ti thu le, in ringna le in hmangaina chanchin lâwmum tak a mi hâwn a."
7,"for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith:","Chuleiin, unauhai, kan lungin- rimna le rinumna po poah, in ringna leiin in chungah thlamuongtakin kan um tah."
8,"for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.","Tuhin chu kan hring tah, Lalpaah in ngîr det phawt hin chu."
9,"For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;","Ei Pathien hmaah in chunga kan hlimna po po lei hin, nangni tieng thuah ieng lâwmthu am Pathien kuomah hril ve thei kan ti aw?"
10,"night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?","In hmêl kan hmu theina ding le, in ringna tienga in tlâksamna kan phuhrûk pêk theina ding cheuin a sûn a zânin nasatakin kan ṭawngṭai zing a nih."
11,"Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you:","Chuongchun, ei Pathien le ei Pa ngei chun, ei Lalpa Isu khawmin nangni kuom tiengah mi ṭhuoi raw se."
12,"and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you;","Chun, nangni tienga hmangai- na kan hau angin, nangni laia inhmangaituona le mi po po tienga hmangaina chu Lalpain sukpungin inhautir raw se cheu;"
13,"to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.","chuongchun, ei Lalpa Isu, a mi inthienghai po po le a hung pha, ei Pathien le ei Pa hmaah in lungrilhai inthiengna kawngah sawisêlboin sukdet thei a ti cheu."
