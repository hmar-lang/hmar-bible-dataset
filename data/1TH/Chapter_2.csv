verse_no,en,hmr
1,"For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found vain:","Unauhai, nangni laia kan hung lûtna kha a lo thlâwn nawh ti nangni ngeiin in hriet sih a;"
2,"but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict.","thlâwn nêk hmanin, in hriet ta angin, kha hma khan Philippia chun rinum tuor le inzaktaka siemin lo um ta inlang khawm, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha chu, kan Pathiena huoina neiin, dodâlna nasatak kârah, in kuomah kan puong ta lem kha."
3,"For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:","Kan thu hril hi khêla suok a ni si nawh a, inthieng nawnaa suok a ni bawk nawh a, zâwrnain a ni bawk nawh a;"
4,"but even as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proveth our hearts.","Chanchin Ṭha inkawltira um dingin Pathien ṭhati zâwng mi kan ni ang ngeiin, mihriem suklâwm ding ang ni loin, kan lungril fietu Pathien suklâwm lemin thu kan hril lem hlak a nih."
5,"For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness;","Ieng lai khawma inpâk tehlêmna thu amanih, duâm inkhumna ama- nih, kan hmang lai an hriet nawh ti in hriet kha (Pathien a mi hrietpuitu a nih.)"
6,"nor seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.","Mihriem laiah, nangni laia manih, mi danghai laia mani khawm chawimawina kan zawng ngai nawh;"
7,"But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children:","Krista tirkohai kan nina leiin inkhâwkpuium kan lo ni el thei de khawmin. Nu nau pawmin ama nau- hai a duot angin, nangni laiah zaidamtakin kan um lem kha."
8,"even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us.","Chuong ang bawkin, kan dit zâwng tak in hung ni ta lei khan, kan dit ngawi ngawi cheu a, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha chau ni loin kan hring- na rau khawm pêk cheu kan inhuom kha."
9,"For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.","Unauhai, kan thaw sâwlzie le kan sin inrimzie kha in hriet zing deh! nangni laia tûkhawm kan sukkhâwk nawna ding cheuin a sûn a zâna sin thawin, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha kan hril hlak cheu kha."
10,"Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe:","Nangni ringtuhai chungah in- thiengtak le feltak le, demum lotaka kan umzie kha Pathien leh a mi hrietpuituhai in nih;"
11,"as ye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying,","pain ama nauhai chunga a thaw angin in chunga kan thawzie kha in hriet, infui le thlamuon le inhriettir cheuin, in chung senga kan thawzie kha;"
12,"to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.",Ama ram le ropuinaa kolûttu cheu Pathien mi ni tlâka in um theina dingin.
13,"And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, even the word of God, ye accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe.","Hi hi lei hin ma loin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu kan hril bawk hlak, Pathien thu kan kuoma inthawka in hriet, in pawm lai khan, mihriem thu pawmin in pawm nawh a, Pathien thu pawma in pawm lem lei khan; chu chu Pathien thu a ni hrim a, nangni a ringtuhai sûnga sin thaw hlak bawk chu a nih."
14,"For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judæa in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;","Nangni unauhai, Judai rama Pathien kohran, Krista Isua umhai inchûktu in lo ni kha; anni chun Judahai laia an tuor angin nangni khawmin nangni rama mihai laia inthawkin in tuor ve bawk sih a."
15,"who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and please not God, and are contrary to all men;","Chuong Judahai chun Lalpa Isu le zâwlneihai khawm an that a, keini khawm an mi hnawt suok a, Pathien an suklâwm nawh a, mi po po an kal hlak;"
16,forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.,"sandam an ni theina dinga Jentailhai laia thu hril an mi khap hlak sih a, chuong anga an suol inkhi- na suksip rawp dingin, nisienla- khawm, lunginsenna chu an chungah a tâwp khâwk râwtin a hung tlung tah."
17,"But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire:","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, sâwt nâwtea dingin nangni leh lungril tienga inṭhe loin, hmêl tieng chaua inṭhea ei um hri lei hin, inhâwk tak puma in hmêl hmu dingin kan beisei nasa nâwk zuol hlak a nih;"
18,"because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.","in kuomah hung kan tum tlat sih a; kei Paula ngei khawm hin vawi hni rau hung ka tum nghe nghe tah a; nisienlakhawm, Setanin a mi hluo hlak a nih."
19,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?","Kan beiseina amanih, kan hlimna amanih, kan lallukhum suong amani chu ieng am a na? A hung phaleh ei Lalpa Isu hmaa chun nangni ngei in ni ding a ni naw am a nih?"
20,For ye are our glory and our joy.,Nangni hi kan isuong le kan hlimna in nih in sawnnaw.
