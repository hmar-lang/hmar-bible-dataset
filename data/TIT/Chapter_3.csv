6,"which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;","Chun, Thlarau Inthieng chu Isu Krista ei sandamtu zâra chun nasa- takin ei chungah a buok kha."
7,"that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.","Chuongchun, a lunginsietnaa thiem inchangtira hung umin, cha- tuona hringna beiseina ang peiin rohluotu dinga siemin um thei ei tih."
8,"Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:","“Pathien ring tahai chun thil ṭha thaw pei dingin ngaituo raw se,” ti thu hi ring a um a nih, chuong thu chanchin chu huoitaka i hril tlat ka nuom a nih.

15,All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.,Ka kuoma um po po hin chibai an bûk che. Ringnaa mi hmangai- tuhai kha chibai mi hung bûkpêk rawh. In rênga kuomah lunginsietna um raw se.
