1,"Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.","Aw Pathien, ka lungzîngna thua hin ka râwl hi lo ngai la, A mi dotuhai ṭitumnaa inthawk hin ka hringna hi humhim rawh."
2,"Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;","Thil ṭha naw thawtuhai inrâwn rûknaa inthawk chun mi thuphmang la, Thil suksuoltuhai inhâwrkhâwmhaia inthawk chun:"
3,"Who have whet their tongue like a sword, And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,","Chuonghai chun kâwlhnâm angin an lei an tâtngei a, An thal, thu khahai chun an tin hlak;"
4,"That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.","Mi demkailo chu hmun fienriela an kâp theina dingin; Ṭi lovin, kârlovin an kâp thut hlak."
5,"They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who will see them?","Thil suol thaw ding chun an infui tuoh a, Châng, inrûka kam thua dâm an inbiek hlak a, “Tuin am chuong chu hmûng an ta?” an tih a."
6,"They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, say they, a diligent search: And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep.","Rîtlona an zawng suok hlak a, “Ṭhahnemngaitakin kan zawng zo tah,” an ti hlak a. An sûngtieng ngaituona le lungril chu inthûktak a ni seng nghâl a."
7,But God will shoot at them; With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded.,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chun anni kâp a ta, Kârloa thala inhliemin um an tih."
8,"So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them: All that see them shall wag the head.","Chuongchun, anni lei ngei chun anni a do leiin, sukkatin um an ta, Anni hmu taphawthai chun an lu thinkhum an tih."
9,"And all men shall fear; And they shall declare the work of God, And shall wisely consider of his doing.","Chuongchun, mi po poin ṭîng an ta, Pathien sinthaw chu hril an tih; A thilthaw khawm chu vartakin ngaituong an tih."
10,"The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory.","Mi felhai chu LALPAAH lâwm an ta, amaa chun ringna innghat an ta, Lungril indiktak put po pohai chun sawng an tih."
