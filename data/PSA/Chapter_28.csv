1,"Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I call: My rock, be not thou deaf unto me; Lest, if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.","Aw LALPA, ka ko ding che a ni hi, Ka lungpui, keimaa inthawk hin i na chu suksêt naw la; Chuong naw chun, nangin i mi tosan chun, Khur sûnga zu fehai ang elin hung um rawi ka tih."
2,"Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.","Ka ko cheh a, ka kuthai hi i biekna hmun inthieng tieng ka phar chun, Lunginsiet ka hnina râwlhai hi lo ngai rawh."
3,"Draw me not away with the wicked, And with the workers of iniquity; That speak peace with their neighbors, But mischief is in their hearts.","Mi rilohai le thil suksuolhai laia chun, Mi hnûkhmang sa naw rawh. Chuonghai chun an vênghai kuomah inremnna thu an hril hlak a, Nisienlakhawm, an lungrilhaia chun thil suksuolna a um zing sih a."
4,"Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings: Give them after the operation of their hands; Render to them their desert.","An thilthaw ang pei le, an thilthawhai a suolzie ang peiin thung la, An kuta an sinthaw ang peiin thung la; An suol man chu inhmutir rawh."
5,"Because they regard not the works of Jehovah, Nor the operation of his hands, He will break them down and not build them up.","LALPA sinthawhai le, A kuta a thilthaw chu an ngaisak naw leiin, Ama chun anni chu siemṭha loin suksieng a tih."
6,"Blessed be Jehovah, Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.","Lunginsiet ka hnîna râwlhai hi a ngai hlak leiin, LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se."
7,"Jehovah is my strength and my shield; My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; And with my song will I praise him.","LALPA chu ka hrâtna le ka phaw a na, Ka lungril hin ama chu a ring a; chuongchun, sanin ka um a, Chuleiin, ka lungril hi nasatakin a hlim a, Ka hla chun ama inpâk ka tih."
8,"Jehovah is their strength, And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.","LALPA chu an hrâtna a na, A hrieknâl ta ding chun sandamna kulbîng a nih."
9,"Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.","I mihai chu sandam la, i rochan chu malsâwm rawh: Anni chu châwm la, kumkhuoin pawm rawh."
