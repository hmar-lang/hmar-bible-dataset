verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,","Mi tinrênghai, hi hi ngai unla, Khawvêla um po pohai na lo sit ro."
2,"Both low and high, Rich and poor together.","Mi chîn le mi lien, Mi hausa le mi rimsi khawmin,"
3,My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.,"Ka bau hin varna thu hril a ta, Ka lungril ngaituo chu hrietthiemna thu nîng a tih."
4,I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.,"Tekhithuah ka na sit ka ta, Ka thu ril hril chu ṭingṭangin hrilfieng ka tih."
5,"Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?","Ni ṭha nawahai, ka kekhawng bulah rîtlona chun a mîn huolvêl khawmin, Iengdingin am ṭîng ka ta?"
6,"They that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;","Mâni sum ring a, Mâni hausakna nasatak suongtuhai chun,"
7,"None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him","Tukhawmin an unau khawm intlan thei tawp naw nih a, Pathien kuomah intlanna pe pêk thei bawk naw ni hai:"
8,"(For the redemption of their life is costly, And it faileth for ever),","An hringna intlanna ding chun thil nasatak sêng ding a na, Kumkhuo khawma a tina tin naw el ding a nih:"
9,"That he should still live alway, That he should not see corruption.","A dam zing a, Hmawnna a hmu nawna ding chun."
10,"For he shall see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.","Mi varhai khawm an thih a, Mi invêt le mi ngawnghai khawm an bohmang ve veh a, An sum mi danghai an mâksanpêk hlakhai chu an hriet sih a."
11,"Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, And their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.","An lungril ngaituo dân chu, An inhai chu kumkhuoa um ding ang le, An umnahai chu suon po po chena um ding ang a nih. An ramhai chu anni hming ruok an inputtir hlak."
12,But man being in honor abideth not: He is like the beasts that perish.,"Nisienlakhawm, mihriem hi chawimawiin an um zing nawh a. Sa bohmang hlakhai ang el hi an nih."
13,This their way is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. [Selah,"Invêttaka mâni inringzohai chan, Mâni sumneia lungawi elhai tâwpna chu hi hi a nih:"
14,"They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd: And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, That there be no habitation for it.","Berâm ruol angin Seol ta dinga ruot an na, Thina chu an vêngtu ning a ta, Zîngtieng chun mi indiktakhaiin an chungah thu nei an ta, An umna hrim hrim a um nawna dingin, an mawina chu Seol suksiet ding nîng a tih."
15,But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. [Selah,"Ka hringna ruok chu Pathienin Seola inthawkin intlan suok a tih, Ama chun a mi lâwm âwm sih a."
16,"Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased:","Mi sukhausaka a hung um a, A sungkuo ropuina chu a hung nasat deu deu khawmin ṭi naw rawh:"
17,For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him.,"A thi pha chun iengkhawm a sawm naw ding a na, A ropuina chun a zui thlâk âwm si nawh a."
18,"Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself),","A dam laiin insukengthâwl sienla khawm, (A hlawtlingna leiin mi inpâk hlaw sien khawm)."
19,He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.,"A thlatuhai suon kuomah fêng a tih, Iengtika khawm var hmu ta lo dinghai kuoma chun."
20,"Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish.","Mihriem chawimawia uma, hrietthiemna nei si lo chu, Sa bohmang hlakhai ang el hi an nih."
