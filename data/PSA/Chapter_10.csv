8,He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless.,"Khaw tina inchân rûkna hmunhaiah a ṭhung hlak a, Hmun fienriela chun pawitâwk- lo mihai a that hlak a; A mitin iengkhawm thaw thei lo mi chu ân chânrûk zing hlak."
9,"He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.","Sakeibakneiin a pûka ân chân- rûk angin, ama chun fienriel- ah ân chânrûk zing hlak a; Mi rimsi man dingin an chân hlak a, Mi rimsi chu a man ngei a; chuongchun, a lênin a keihmang hlak."
