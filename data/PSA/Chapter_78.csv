1,"Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.","Aw ka mihai, ka dân thua hin na lo sit unla, Ka baua thuhaiah in na hung daw ro."
2,"I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,","Tekhithuin ka bau kâng ka ta, Tiena thu ril hril tahai kha hril suok ka tih."
3,"Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.","Chuong chu ei nain ei hriet a, ei lungrilin ei hriet bawk a, Ei thlatuhai khawmin an mi hril bawk kha."
4,"We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.","Chuong chu an nauhai kuomah ip nâwm ei nih a, Ruolthar hung dinghai kuoma LALPA inpâkna thu le, A hrâtzie le a thilmaktak thawzie chu hril lem ei tih."
5,"For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;","Jakobhai laiah thuinhriettir a sukdet a; Israelhai lai dân a ruot a, Chuong chu ei thlatuhai kuomah thupêkin a pêk a; Anni chun chuong thu chu an nauhai kuomah an inhriettir dingin."
6,"That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell them to their children,","Ruolthar la hung um ding, naupang la hung pieng dinghai chun an hriet theina dingin; Chuonghai chu an tho a, an nauhai kuoma an la hrilsâwng peina dingin;"
7,"That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,","An beiseina chu Pathienah an innghat theia, Pathien thilthawhai chu an theinghil nawha, A thupêkhai chu an zâwm lemna dingin;"
8,"And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.","Le, an thlatuhai anga, Suon kâwmaw le hel hmang, Suon lungril siem diklo, Pathien kuoma lungril ringum naw puta an um nawna dingin."
9,"The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.","Ephraim thlahai chu râlthuoma inthuoma, thalngul chawiin, Inthaw ni chun an tlânseh a."
10,"They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;","Pathien thuthlung chu an zâwm nawh a, A dâna um an nuom naw bawk a;"
11,"And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them.","A thilthawhai chu an thei- nghil a, A thilmak thaw ân hmutirhai khawm chu."
12,"Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.","An thlatuhai mithmuah thilmakhai a thaw hlak a, Aigupta rama Zoan phûla chun."
13,"He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.","Tuisuoriet chu a sukṭhe phawk a, anni chu ân fe kâitir a, Tuihai chu iengkhat sie khâwm thûr angin ân ngîrtir nguou a."
14,"In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.","Sûna chun sûmin a ṭhuoi a, Zânkhawvârin meichawkin a ṭhuoi bawk hlak a."
15,"He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.","Thlalêra chun lungpuihai a sukkhawi bawk a, Tui inthûktaka inthawk ang el, ditkhawpa dâwn ding a pêk a."
16,"He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.","Lungpuia inthawk chu vadunghai a suksuok a, Tuihai chu vadungpuihai ang elin ân luong thlâktir a."
17,"Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.","Chuong sa khawma a chungah thil an la suksuol ta rawp a, Ram ṭâwla chun Achunghnungtak chunga chun an hel a."
18,And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.,"An châkna sukre dinga fâk ding hniin, An lungrilin Pathien an fieh a."
19,"Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?","Anih, Pathien an hrilhnâwm a, “Thlalêra hin Pathienin daw- kân a buotsai thei am chu?"
20,"Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?","Ngai ta, lungpui chu a vuokin tuihai kha a hung inkhâw suokin, Vadunghai chu a kuong a liem pûr pûr ta luoh a, Bu khawm a pêk thei nghâl am chu? A mihai ta ding hin sa a buot- sai ding am chu?” an tih a."
21,"Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;","Chuongchun, LALPA chun a lo hriet a, a lung a sen tah a, Jakobhai chungah mei a hung chawk suok tah a, Israelhai chungah lunginsenna a hung tah a."
22,"Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.","Pathien an ring nawh a, A sandamna khawm an ring naw leiin."
23,"Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;","Nisienlakhawm, chungtienga vân dumhai khi thu a pêk a. Vân kawtkhârhai khi a hawngpêk a."
24,"And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.","An fâk dingin manna kha an chungah a zuk insûrtir a, Vân bu chu an kuomah a pêk a nih."
25,Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.,"Mihriemhaiin mi hrâthai bu chu an fâk a, Khawpna khawpin bu a hung pêk a."
26,He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.,"Khaw sak thli chu vânah ân hrângtir a, A thilthawtheinain sim thli chu a ṭhuoi a."
27,"He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:","Sa chu pilvut zât rauin an chungah ân sûrtir a, Vatê thla nei chu tuisuorieta phaiphin zât rauin."
28,"And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.","An riekhmun laia chun ân tlâktir a, An umna bûk kâwl vêlahai chun."
29,"So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.","Chuongchun, an fâk a, an khawp hleh a, An ichâk chu an kuomah a pêk tah a nih."
30,"They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,","An châk a la re nawh a, An bu chu an bauah a la um a."
31,"When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.","Chuong lai tak chun Pathien lunginsenna chu an chungah a tlah a, An mi thâuhai ṭhenkhat a that a; Israel tlangvâlhai chu a vuok thlûk tâwl a."
32,"For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.","Chuong sa khawmin thil an la suksuol ta rawp a, A thilmak thawhai chu an ring chuong nawh."
33,"Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.","Chuleiin, an dam sûng nihai chu teplo mei meiin a sukbo pêk a, An dam sûng kumhai chu ṭitnain a sukbo pêk bawk a."
34,"When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.","Anni a that poleh ama chu an zawng hlak a, An kîr nâwk a, zîngkâr Pathien an zawng hlak."
35,"And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.","Pathien chu an lungpui a nih ti le, Pathien Achunghnungtak chu an intlantu a nih ti an hriet suok hlak."
36,"But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu an bauin an inpâk tehlêm a, An leiin a kuomah khêlthu an hril hlak."
37,"For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.","An lungril chu ama kuomah ân dik si nawh a, A thuthlunga chun ring an um bawk nawh."
38,"But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu lai- natnaa a sip leiin an rîtlona chu a ngaidam a, anni chu a sukbohmang nawh; Anih, vawi tamtak a lunginsenna chu a lâk kîr a, A lunginsenna chu a rêngin a chawktho nuom ngai nawh."
39,"And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.","Tisa chau an nih ti a hriet zing a, Thli, lêt nâwk lo dinga hrâng liem hlak ang hi."
40,"How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!","Thlalêra khan a chungah an va hel inzingin, Ram ṭâwla khan ama chu an va suklungngai inzing de!"
41,"And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.","An ngha kîr nâwkin Pathien an fieh a, Israelhai mi inthieng chu an suknuor hlak."
42,"They remembered not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;","A kut chu an hriet zing nawh a, Anni dotuhaia inthawka a sanhim ni chu an hriet zing ngai nawh."
43,"How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,","Khânga Aigupta ramah inchiknahai a sieh a, Zoan phûlah thilmakhai a sie bawk a;"
44,"And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.","An vadungpuihai chu thisenah ân changtir a, An vadunghai chu thisenah ân changtir bawk kha; chuong- chun, an dâwn thei ta nawh a."
45,"He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.","Anni lai tho tamtak a tir a; chuongchun, anni chu a fâk zo a, Uhai a tir bawk a, chuongchun, anni chu a sukbohmang tah a."
46,"He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.","An thil kakhai khawm chu tuktulung kuomah a pêk a, An sininrim ra chu khâuṭhikṭhi kuomah a pêk bawk a."
47,"He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.","An grêp hruihai chu rielin a sukhlum a, An theichang kûnghai khawm chu vûrin a sukhlum bawk a."
48,"He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.","An ranhai khawm chu riel kuomah a pêk a, An ranruolhai khawm chu ṭêk lumtak kuomah a pêk bawk."
49,"He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.","A lunginsenna nasatak chu an chungah a thlâk a, Lunginsenna dâm, lungdam nawna dâm, lunginzîngna nasatak dâm hi, Thil ṭha nawtak intluntu tirko pâwl chu."
50,"He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,","A lunginsenna ding chun lampui a siempêk a, An hringna chu thinaa in- thawkin a humhim nawh a, An hringna chu hri kuomah a pêk ta lem a."
51,"And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.","Aigupta rama nau lutîr po po a sukhlum a, Ham puon inhaia an hrâtna ra hmasa takhai chu:"
52,"But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.","Nisienlakhawm, ama mihai chu berâm angin a ṭhuoi- suok a, Ranruol angin thlalêra khan a ṭhuoi a."
53,"And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.","Himtakin a ṭhuoi a, chuongchun, iengkhawm an ṭi nawh a, Nisienlakhawm, tuisuoriet chun an hmêlmahai chu ân khum zo tah a,"
54,"And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.","Chun, a hmun inthieng ramri chu a ṭhuoi tlung a, Hi tlâng a kut changtienga a închâwka hin."
55,"He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.","Hnam tin chu an hmaah a hnawt suok a, Anni chu hruia inkhi dingin rochanah a siem a. An puon ina chun Israel hnamhai chu ân umtir tah a."
56,"Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien Achunghnungtak chu an infieh a, a chungah an hel a, A thu inhhriettirhai chu an zâwm si nawh a."
57,"But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.","Ngha kîrin, an thlatuhai angin vervêktakin an thaw ta lem a: Thalngul ringum naw angin an fe kâwi tah a;"
58,"For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.","An hmun insânghaiin ama chu an suklungsen hlak sih a, An milim siemhaiin an inthîktir bawk a."
59,"When God heard this, he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;","Pathienin chu chu a lo hrietin a lunginsen a, Israelhai chu a tirdak ta êm êm a."
60,"So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;","Chuongchun, Silo biekbûk, Mihriem laia a puon in sie chu, a mâksan a."
61,"And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary’s hand.","A hrâtna chu salah ân man- tir a, A ropuina chu dotuhai kutah ân mantir ta bawk a."
62,"He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.",A mihai chu kâwlhnâm kuomah a pêk a; A rochan chunga chun a lunginsen tah a.
63,Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.,"Meiin an tlangvâlhai chu a kânghmang a, An nunghâkhai chun inneina hla hrim hrim an nei ta nawh a."
64,Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.,"An thiempuhai chu kâwlhnâma sukthlûkin an um a, An hmeithaihai chu ṭap hrim hrim an ṭap nawh."
65,"Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.","Chuong lai chun LALPA chu,mi an in an har angin, a har tah a, Mi hrât uoin leia khêk ang hin."
66,And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.,"Ama dotuhai chu a vuok kîr a, Kumkhaw hmingsietna ân hlawtir tah a."
67,"Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,","Chu naw khawm chu Josef puon in chu a dit nawh a, Ephraim hnam chu a thlang naw bawk a."
68,"But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.","Juda hnam chu a thlang ta lem a, A hmangai Zion tlâng chu."
69,"And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.","A in inthieng chu vân insânghai ang khin a bâwl a, Kumkhuoa dinga a suknghet leihnuoi ang hin."
70,"He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:","A siehlaw David chu a thlang a, Berâm huona inthawk dâm chun a lâk suok a,"
71,"From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.","Berâmpui te ṭhuoihaia inthawkin a ṭhuoi suok a, A mihai Jakobhai le Israelhai châwm dingin."
72,"So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.","Chuongchun, ama chun a lungril ṭhatna ang peiin anni chu a châwm a, A kut thiemnain a ṭhuoi tah a."
