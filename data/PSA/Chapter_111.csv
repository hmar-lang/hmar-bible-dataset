1,"Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.","LALPA chu inpâk ro, Mi indiktakhai inkhâwm- naa le inrâwn khâwmnaa chun, Ka lungril po povin LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril ka tih."
2,"The works of Jehovah are great, Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.","LALPA thilthawhai chu a ro- pui a, A chunga lâwmhai poin zawng suok a ni hlak."
3,His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endureth for ever.,"A sinthaw chu inza a umin a ropui a nih, A felna chu kumkhawtluonga um ding a nih."
4,He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.,"Ama chun a thilmak thawhai chu ân hriet zingtir a, LALPA chu mi lunginsiet theitak, lainatnaa sip a nih."
5,He hath given food unto them that fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant.,"Ama ṭituhai kuoma chun fâk ding a pêk a, A thuthlung chu kumkhuoin hre zing a tih."
6,"He hath showed his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.","A thilthawhai thilthawtheizie chu a mihai kuomah ân langtir a, Hnam tin rochan chu an kuoma pein."
7,The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure.,"A kut thilthawhai chu thutak le rorêlna fel a na, A thununna thu po pohai chu ring a um a nih."
8,They are established for ever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness.,"Chuong chu kumkhawtluonga dingin sukdetin a um a, Thutak le indiktaka thaw a ni tâwl a."
9,He hath sent redemption unto his people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is his name.,"Ama chun a mihai kuomah intlanna a hung tir a, A thuthlung chu kumkhuoa dingin a ruot a, A hming chu ân thiengin inza a um a nih."
10,The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they that do his commandments: His praise endureth for ever.,"LALPA ṭina chu varna bul a na, Chuong anga thaw taphawthai chun hrietthiemna ṭha an nei a. Ama inpâkna chu kumkhaw- tluonga um ding a nih."
