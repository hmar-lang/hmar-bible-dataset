1,"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?","Ka Pathien, ka Pathien, iengdinga i mi mâksan am? Iengdinga mi ṭhangpui dinga i hlat hleh a, kân rûmna thuhaia inthawka i hla am a na?"
2,"O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answerest not; And in the night season, and am not silent.","Aw ka Pathien, sûnah ka khêk a; nisienlakhawm, i dawn si nawh, Zânah ka khêk bawk a, ka to chuong nawh."
3,"But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, aw nang Israelhai inpâknaa chêng hlak, Nang chu în thieng a nih."
4,"Our fathers trusted in thee: They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.","Kan thlatuhai chun an lo ring cheh a, An ring a; chuongchun, nangin i lo sandam hlak."
5,"They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.","An ko cheh a; chuongchun, sanhimin an um hlak a, An ring cheh a; chuongchun, muolphoin an um ngai nawh."
6,"But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised of the people.","Kei ruok chu mihriem hrim ka ni nawh a, chawkchawnâl el ka nih, Mihriemhai hrilsiet le mihai hmusit ka nih."
7,"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,","A mi hmu taphawtin an mi nuisan a, An hner an phen a, an lu an thin a;"
8,"Commit thyself unto Jehovah; let him deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him.","“LALPA chungah innghat ta la, ama chun ama hi sandam raw se chu! A chungah a lâwm leiin sanhim raw se chu,” an tih a."
9,But thou art he that took me out of the womb; Thou didst make me trust when I was upon my mother’s breasts.,"Nang ruok chu sula inthawka mi la suoktu i na, Ka nu nêne chunga ka um lai khan nangin i mîn ringtir a."
10,I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God since my mother bare me.,"Sula inthawk hrimin nangma chunga innghat ka na, Nang chu ka nu phîng sûnga inthawk hrim tah ka Pathien i nih."
11,Be not far from me; for trouble is near; For there is none to help.,"Mîn hlat lul naw rawh, lungin- zingna ding a hnai sih a, Ṭhangpuitu ding hrim hrim an um si nawh."
12,Many bulls have compassed me; Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.,"Sebâwngchal tamtakin an mîn huolvêl a, Basan rama sebâwngchal hrât- takhai chun an mîn huolvêl khup a."
13,"They gape upon me with their mouth, As a ravening and a roaring lion.","Sakeibaknei hnukinrâwl inhûk hmang angin, An bauvin an mi khêkkhum a."
14,"I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.","Tui anga bunthlâkin ka um a, Ka ru po po khawm inpelsawlin a um a, Ka lungril hi khuoihlu ang a na; ka rîl lai hin ân tui zo tah."
15,My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; And thou hast brought me into the dust of death.,"Ka tha hi bekawihâr angin a ṭâwl zo vawng a, Ka lei khawm hi ka dangah a kawp ta tlat a; Nangin thina pilvuta hin i mi ṭhuoi lût tah a ni hi."
16,For dogs have compassed me: A company of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.,"Uihai chun an mîn huolvêl sih a, Thil ṭha naw thawtu um khâwmhai chun an mîn huol tlat a, Ka kut le ka kehai hi an sukpawp a."
17,I may count all my bones. They look and stare upon me;,"Ka ru po po hi ka tiem vawng thei a, Anni hlak chun an mi enin an mi mel zing a:"
18,"They part my garments among them, And upon my vesture do they cast lots.","Ka silfênhai an insem a, Ka zakuo dingin ai an sân a,"
19,"But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: O thou my succor, haste thee to help me.","Nang ruok chun, aw LALPA, mîn hlat lul naw la, Aw, mi sukhrâttu, mi ṭhangpui dingin inhmaw rawh."
20,"Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog.",Ka hringna hi kâwlhnâma inthawk chun sanhim la. Ka nei sun tak hi ui thilthawtheinaa inthawk chun sanhim rawh.
21,"Save me from the lion’s mouth; Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me.","Sakeibaknei baua inthawk chu mi sanhim la, Anih, ramsielchal kiha mi chu nangin i mi dawn tah a."
22,I will declare thy name unto my brethren: In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.,"Ka unauhai kuomah i hming hril ka ta, Inkhâwmhai laia chun inpâk ka ti che."
23,"Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.","LALPA ṭituhai, ama chu inpâk ro, Jakob thla po pohai, ama chu chawimawi ro; Israel thla po pohai, ama chu ṭi ro."
24,"For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Neither hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard.","Ama chun rinum tuortu rinumzie chu a hmusit nawh a, a tirdak bawk nawh; A hmai chu a kuoma inthawkin a thup nawh a, Ama a ko chun a lo ngai lem hlak."
25,Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.,"Inkhâwmna ropuitaka kân pâk hlakna che hi nangma kuoma mi a na, Ama ṭîtuhai hmaa chun ka thutiem hi hlen ka tih."
26,The meek shall eat and be satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for ever.,"Thuhnuoirawlhai chun fâng an ta, tlai an tih: Ama zawngtuhai chun LALPA chu inpâk an ta, An lungril chu kumkhuoin hringin um raw se."
27,All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.,"Kâwlkawdawnga mi po po khawmin hre nâwk an ta, LALPA tieng ngha tâng an tih: Hnam tina chi tin i hmaah kûn an tih."
28,For the kingdom is Jehovah’s; And he is the ruler over the nations.,"Ram chu LALPA ta a na, Hnam tin chungah rorêltu a ni sih a."
29,"All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.","Hnuoia mi neinunghai po po chun fain chibai bûk an ta, Pilvuta kîr nâwk dinghai po po khawm chu a hmaah la kûn an tih: Mâni hringna sukhring zing thei lo chu."
30,A seed shall serve him; It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.,"Chi inthlain a rawng bâwl an ta, Ṭhangthar hung um nâwkhai kuoma chun LALPA chanchin chu la hril an tih."
31,"They shall come and shall declare his righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.","Hung an ta, hnam la hung suok dinghai kuoma chun, “A thaw zo tah,” tiin, a felzie chu lân hriettir an tih."
