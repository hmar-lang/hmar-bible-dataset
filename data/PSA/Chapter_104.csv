2,Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;,"Nang chun var chu puon angin în bel a, Vânhai khi puon in chung angin i kei phar a."
3,Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;,"Nang chun i pindan chunghnung kalkhanghai chu tuiahai khin i khang a, Sûmhai khi i tawlailîrah i siem a; Thli thla chungahai chun i lêng a."
4,Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers;,"Thlihai chu i vântirkohai în changtir a, Meichawk dur dur hai chu i rawngbâwltuahai în changtir hlak."

7,At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away,"I kâwkna lei chun an tlân- hmang a, I vâninrûm ri lei chun an fe hmang ta vak a."
8,"(The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.","Tlângahai an hung ngîr suok a, Ruomahai an ṭum thlah a, An ta dinga hmun i buotsaina tieng chun."
9,Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.,"An khêl naw dingin ri i khang a, Hnuoi chîm tlum dinga an lêt nâwk ta nawna dingin."
10,He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;,"Nang chun vadung ruomhaia dâm chun tuihnârhai i tir suok a, Tlânghai kâra chun an luong a."
11,They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst.,"Chuonghai chun ram sa tinrênghai kuomah dâwn ding an pêk hlak a, Ram sabengtunghai chun an dangchâr an sukbo hlak."
12,By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches.,"A kamhaia chun chunglêng va- têhaiin umna an nei hlak a, Thing buk laia chun an inhrâm hlak."

14,"He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,","Hlobet chu ranhai ta dingin ân mâwngtir a, Thlai chu mihriem hmang dingin ân mâwngtir bawk a, Hnuoia inthawk fâk ding ân suoktir theina dingin."
15,"And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, And oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man’s heart.","Mihriem lungril suklâwmna uoin leh, A hmai suktlawrna ding hriek leh, Mihriem lungril sukhrâtna bei leh."
16,"The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;","LALPA thinghai chu an khawp hlak, Lebanon tlânga sidar thing a iphunhai chu."
17,"Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.","Chutaka chun vatêhai chun bu an sep hlak a, Vakâwl ruok chu fâr thing chu a in a nih."
18,The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.,"Tlâng insânghai chu sakêl ta ding a na, Lungpuihai chu mazupui ta dinga inhumhimna a nih."
19,He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.,"Ama chun thla khi hunbi hrietna dingin a ruot a, Nisa khin a tlâk pha chu a hriet hlak."
20,"Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.","Nang chun inthim i siem a, zân a hung na, Chu huna chun ramhnuoia sa tinrênghai chu an tla suok hlak."
21,"The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.","Sakeibaknei vânglaihai chun an sa se ding chu inrûmkhumin, Pathien kuoma inthawka an fâk ding an zawng hlak."
22,"The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.","Nisa a suok a, an fe hmang a, An umna pûk senga chun an zâl hlak."
23,Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening.,"Mihriem chu sinthaw dingin a suok a, Zântieng chenin inrimtakin a thaw hlak."

25,"Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts.","Sawtaka sawn tuisuoriet a um a, nasatak lientak el chu, Sawtaka sawn thilhring bawk- vâka lâwn tiem sêng lo an um a, Sa chîn le sa lienhai chu."

28,"Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.","An kuoma i pêk taphawt an rût hlak a, I kut i phar a, ṭhatnain an khawp hlak."
29,"Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust.","I hmai i thup a, an lunginzîng hlak a, An thuok chu i lâkpêk a, an thih a, An pilvuta chun an kîr nâwk hlak."
30,"Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground.","I thlarau chu i tir suok a, siemin an um hlak; Hnuoi chung khawm hi i siem thar nâwk hlak."
31,Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:,"LALPA ropuina chu kumkhaw- tluongin um sienla, LALPA chu a thilthawahai chun hlim raw se."
32,"Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.","Ama chun hnuoi hi a en a, ân thin hlak a, Tlânghai chu a them a, a khu suok hlak."
33,I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.,"Ka dam sûng po chu LALPA chawimawiin hla sak ka ta, Ka hring sûng po chu ka Pathien chu inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
34,Let my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.,"Ka ngaituona hi ama ta dingin thlumtak ni raw se, Kei chu LALPAA chun hlim ka tih."
35,"Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.","Mi suolhai chu hnuoia inthawk hin sukbohmangin um hai sienla, Mi rilohai chu um ta naw raw hai se! Aw ka hringna, LALPA chu inpâk rawh! LALPA chu inpâk ro!"
