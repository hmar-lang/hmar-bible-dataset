2,I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.,"Kawng ṭha famkima chun vartakin um ka ta, Aw iengtik âm ka kuomah hung i ta? Ka in sûngah lungril ṭha famkim putin um ka tih."
3,I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; It shall not cleave unto me.,"Thil ṭha naw hrim hrim ka mithmua chun sie naw ningah a, Fe pêthai thilthaw chu ka theida a nih; Keimaah kawp naw nih."
4,A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing.,"Lungril kâwmâw chun mi mâksan a ta, Thil suol hrim hrim hre naw ningah."
5,"Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy: Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.","Tukhawm a vênghai inrûka rêl taphawt chu, chu mi chu sukbohmang ka tih, Mit insâng le lungril chapo put mi chu ngaithei naw ning."
6,"Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.","Hi rama mi ringumhai chunga hin ka mit fûng a ta, ka kuoma an um theina dingin; Kawng ṭha famkim hrawtu chun, ama chun ka rawng bâwl a tih."
7,He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.,"Mi hlêm hmang chu ka in sûngah um naw nih a, Khêl hril hmang chu ka mithmuah sukdetin um naw nih."
8,Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.,"Tûk tin hi rama mi rilohai hi sukbohmang ka ta, LALPA khawpuia inthawk hin thil suksuoltuhai po po sukbohmang dingin."
