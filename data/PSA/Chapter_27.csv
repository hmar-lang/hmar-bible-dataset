1,Jehovah is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?,"LALPA chu ka var le ka sandamna a nih, tu am ṭîng ka ta? LALPA chu ka hringna kulbîng a nih; tu am ṭîng ka ta?"
2,"When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.","Thil ṭha naw thawhai, mi dotu- hai le ka hmêlmahai chun, ka sa fâk tuma an mi thaw lai khan, An insui a, an tlu tâwl tah a."
3,"Though a host should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear: Though war should rise against me, Even then will I be confident.","Sipai pâwlhai chun mi thaw tumin mi ep zing hai sienla khawm, Ka lungril hin ṭi naw ni; Ka chungah indona hung suok sienla khawm, Chuong ang a khawm chun ring tlat ka tih."
4,"One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his temple.","LALPA kuomah thil pakhat ka hnih a, chu mawl chu zawng ka tih, LALPA mawizie hmu ding le a biekina thu indawn dingin, Ka dam sûng poa LALPA ina ka um zing theina ding chu."
5,For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; He will lift me up upon a rock.,"Lunginzîng ni chun a bûktêah a mi sie hmang âwm sih a, A humhimna puon ina chun mi thuphmang a tih; Lungpui chungah mi dawm kai a tih."
6,"And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.","Tuhin chu a mi dotu, a mîn huolvêltuhai chungtieng ka lu hi dawm kângin um a tih, Chuongchun, a puon ina chun hlimna inthâwinahai inhlân ka tih; Hla sak ka ta, anih, LALPA inpâkin hla sak ka tih."
7,"Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice: Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.","Aw LALPA, ka râwla ka ko che chun lo ngai la, Mi lunginsiet la, mi dawn bawk rawh."
8,"When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.","“Ka hmêl zawng ro,” tih a i hril lai khan, ka lungril chun i kuomah, “LALPA, i hmêl zawng ka tih,” a tih a."
9,"Hide not thy face from me; Put not thy servant away in anger: Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.","Ka kuoma inthawk hin i hmai thup naw la, I siehlaw hi i lunginsenin sukbohmang naw la, Nang chu a mi ṭhangpuitu i ni hlak a, Aw a mi sandamtu Pathien, mi pei thla naw la, mi mâksan lul naw rawh."
10,"When my father and my mother forsake me, Then Jehovah will take me up.","Ka nu le pa chun an mi mâksan ta sih a, Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun mi la pawm a tih."
11,"Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; And lead me in a plain path, Because of mine enemies.","Aw LALPA, i lampui chu mîn entir la, Ka hmêlmahai lei hin, Lampui inpheitakah mi ṭhuoi rawh."
12,"Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries: For false witnesses are risen up against me, And such as breathe out cruelty.","A mi dotuhaiin nuom nuoma an mi thaw dingin mi pe lul naw la, Hretu tehlêm chun an mi thawh a, nunsiet thu sâksuok hlaktuhai chun."
13,"I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living.","Mi hring rama hin, LALPA ṭhatna hmu inring naw lang chu ka chau ta ding a nih."
14,"Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, and let thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.","LALPA chu nghâk zing rawh, Hrâttakin um la, i lungril chu insukhuoi raw se; Anih, LALPA chu nghâk zing rawh."
