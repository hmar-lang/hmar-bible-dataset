1,"Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;","Aw kan inpâk Pathien, to zing naw la,"
2,For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.,Mi rilo bau le bau mi hlêm- hmang chu ka chungah an ka sih a; Anni chun lei khêlinhlipin ka kuomah thu an hril a.
3,"They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.","Theidâna thuin a mîn huol vêl a, Ieng ni bar loin an mi do a."
4,For my love they are my adversaries: But I give myself unto prayer.,"Ka lunginsiet leiin a mi dotuhai an hung ni tah a; Nisienlakhawm, kei chu ṭawng- ṭâi dingin kân pêk tlat a."
5,"And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love.","Anni chun thil ṭha chu thil suolin an mi thung a, Ka hmangaina chu theidanain an mi thung bawk a."
6,Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.,"Nangin a chungah mi suol sie la, A changtieng chun hêktu ngîr raw se."
7,"When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.","Rorêlpêka a um pha thiemlo changin suok sienla, A ṭawngṭâina suolnaah inchang raw se."
8,Let his days be few; And let another take his office.,"A dam sûng nihai chu hung tlâwm sienla, A hotu nina chu mi dangin chang raw se."
9,"Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.","A nauhai chu pa boin um sienla, A nuhmei chu hmeithaiin um bawk raw se;"
10,"Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.","A nauhai chu mi invâi hung niin kut daw sienla, An fâk ding chu an hmun hluihaia chun zawng raw se."
11,Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.,"A pung hnawta tangka inpûk- tirtu chun a nei po po chu lâkpêk vawng sienla, Mikhuolhai chun a sininrim ra chu lâkpêk raw hai se."
12,Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.,"A chunga ngilneina inlangtir pei dingtu tukhawm um naw sienla, A nau, pa bohai chu lunginsiet- tu ding tukhawm um bawk naw raw se."
13,Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.,"A thlahai chu sukbohmangin um sienla, Ruolthar hung um nâwka chun an hming chu thai hmangin um raw se."
14,Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.,"A thlatuhai rîtlona chu LALPA kuomah hriet zingin um sien la, A nu suolna chu thai hmangin um naw raw se."
15,"Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;","Chuonghai chu LALPA hmaah um naw sienla, Ama chun anni hriet zingna chu hnuoia inthawka a sukbo theina dingin."
16,"Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay them.","Zâinêmna inlangtir nachâng a hriet nawh a, Mi rimsi, pasie le lungriem ithlâkhai chu sukhlum tuma, a suknawmna lem hlak leiin."
17,"Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.","Anih, mi ṭawngse inphur hi a nuom zawng a na; chuongchun, ama chungah a hung tlung a, Mi malsâwmpêk hi a lâwm- zâwng a ni nawh a; chuong- chun, ama ihlat daiah a um a."
18,"He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.","Kawrfuola inthuom angin, ṭawngse inphurnain ân thuom a, Chu chu a sûngahai chun tui angin a lût a, A ruhaia chun hriek angin a lût bawk a."
19,"Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.","Chu chu a ta dingin ân belna hlak silfên angin um sienla, A în khit rawpna kâwngkhi ni bawk raw se."
20,"This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.","Chuong chu a mi dotuhai le ka hringna hrilsetuhai, LALPAIN a thungna a na."
21,"But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name’s sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;","Nisienlakhawm, aw Pathien LALPA, nangin i hming leiin mi thawpui la, I ngilneina chu a ṭhat leiin mi sanhim rawh."
22,"For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.","Rimsi le pasetak ka nih a, Ka lungril hi ka sûngah inhliemin a um bawk sih a."
23,I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.,"Hlim botieng intung tah ang hin ka bo a, Khâuṭhikṭhi ang hin lên hmangin ka um a."
24,My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.,"Ka khûphai hi bu nghei leiin a hrât ta nawh a, Ka taksa hin thâu hrim a put ta nawh."
25,"I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head.","Anni ihrilsiet ka lo ni tah a, An mi hmu phingleh an lu an thin hlak."
26,"Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, mi ṭhangpui la, Aw i ngilneina ang peiin mi sandam rawh."
27,"That they may know that this is thy hand; That thou, Jehovah, hast done it.","Chu chu i kut a nih ti an hriet thei a, LALPA, nangin i thaw a nih ti an hriet theina dingin."
28,"Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.","Anni chun ṭawngsie inphur raw hai se, nang ruok chun malsâwm lem rawh, An tho phingleh muolpho an ta, i siehlaw ruok chu hlim a tih."
29,"Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.","A mi dotuhai chu inzakna puon insiltirin um hai sienla, Zakuoa intuom angin, anni muolphona chun intuom raw se."
30,"I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.","Ka bau hin LALPA kuomah lâwmthu nasatak hril ka ta, Anih, mipui laia chun ama chu inpâk ka tih."
31,"For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.","Ama chu pase changtieng chun ngîr a ta, A hringna rorêlpêktuhaia inthawka sandam dingin."
