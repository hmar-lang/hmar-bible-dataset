2,"For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart;","En ta u, lungril indiktak put inthim hnuoia an kâp theina dingin, Mi rilohai chun thalngul an kuoi a, An thal chu a hruiah an inbûk diem saw!"

6,Upon the wicked he will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.,"Mi rilohai chunga chun chânghai insûrtir a ta, Mei le kât le thil lumtak chu an no chan ding nîng a tih."
7,For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth righteousness: The upright shall behold his face.,"LALPA chu a fel sih a, felna hi a ngaina hlak, Mi indiktakhai chun a hmêl la hmûng an tih."
