1,"O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?",Aw Pathien Iengdinga kumkhuoa i mi thlauthlâk am a na? Iengdinga i ran tlatna hmuna berâmhai chunga hin i lungsen a khûk am a na?
2,"Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; And mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.","I mihai inkhâwmhai, inhmaha i închâwk, Hnam i ro dinga i întlan kha, hre zing rawh; I umna hlak Zion tlâng leh."
3,"Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.","Kumkhaw rêmna tieng chun i ke khai la, Dotuhaiin hmun inthienga chun thil suol tinrêng an thaw ta hi."
4,Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs.,"Nangma dotuhai chu i mihai inkhâwmhai laia chun an hawhaw dur dur a, An inchiknahai chu inchikna dingin an khai tah a."
5,They seemed as men that lifted up Axes upon a thicket of trees.,"Mi, rampui thing, Hreipuia tinhai angin an inlang a."
6,And now all the carved work thereof They break down with hatchet and hammers.,"Tuhin chu a thil kermawihai po po chu, Hreite le tubauhaiin an suksiet zo tah a."
7,They have set thy sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting it to the ground.,"I hmun inthieng chu an rawh a, I hming umna khawm chu leihnuoi ichîm khawp hielin an sukkhawhlo tah a."
8,"They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.","An lungrila chun, “Sukse vawng tâwl ei tiu,” an tih a, Hi rama Pathien inkhâwmna in po po hi an raw siet zo tah."
9,We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.,"Kan inchiknahai chu kan hmu ta nawh a, Zâwlnei hrim hrim an um ta nawh a, A sâwt dingzie hre hrim hrim khawm keini lai an um nawh."
10,"How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?","Aw Pathien, dotu chun ieng chen am a hrilsiet ding che? Hmêlma chun kumkhuoin i hming hi a hrilsiet ding am a nih?"
11,"Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them.","Iengdinga i kut, i kut changtieng kha i lâk kîr am a na? Kei dawk nâwk la, anni chu sukbohmang rawh."
12,"Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chu inhma chena ka Lal a nih, Hnuoi laitaka sandamna siemhlaktu chu."
13,Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.,"Nang chun i hrâtnain tuisuoriet kha i sukṭheh a, Nang chun tuia drakonhai luhai chu i sukkawi a."
14,Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.,"Nang chun Leviathan luhai chu i suknâwi a, Ama chu thlalêra umhai kuoma chun bu dingin i pêk a,"
15,Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers.,"Nang chun tuihnâr le tuilien chu în ṭhe huk a, Nang chun vadung lientak takhai chu i sukkang a."
16,"The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.","Sûn hi i ta a na, zân khawm i ta a nih; Nangin êntu le nisa khi i buotsai a."
17,Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made summer and winter.,"Nangin leihnuoi ramrihai po po chu i khang vawng a, Nangin nipui le thlasik hi i siem a."
18,"Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name.","Aw LALPA, hi hi hre zing rawh, dotu chun a hrilsiet cheh a. Hnam invêttak chun i hming an hrilsiet kha."
19,Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.,"Aw, i vaṭhu hringna hi ram sahrâng kuoma chun pe lul naw la, I mi rimsihai hringna hi kumkhuo chun theinghil lul naw rawh."
20,Have respect unto the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.,"Thuthlung kha hung pawisa la, Hnuoi hmun inthim lai chu nunsietnain a sip sih a."
21,Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise thy name.,"Aw, nêksâwrna tuortuhai chu muolphoin kîr naw sienla, Rimsi le pasiehai chun i hming inpâk raw se."
22,"Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.","Aw Pathien, tho la, nangma thu chu nangin inhril fâwm la, Mi invêt chun sûnnithlâkin a hrilsietzie che chu hre zing rawh."
23,Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.,"Nangma dotuhai ri chu theinghil naw la, Nangma dotuhai ri so insâng zuol pei chu."
