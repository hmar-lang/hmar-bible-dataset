2,Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; Thou understandest my thought afar off.,"Nangin ka ṭhung le ka ngîr hi i hriet hlak a, Ka ngaituona hi hlataka inthawk khawmin i hriet thiem hlak."
3,"Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, And art acquainted with all my ways.","Ka fe le ka zâl hi i mi en ngun hlak a, Ka um dân po po hi i hriet vawng a."
4,"For there is not a word in my tongue, But, lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether.","Ngai ta, aw LALPA nangin i hriet fai vawng naw chu, Ka leia hin thu hrim hrim a um nawh."
5,"Thou hast beset me behind and before, And laid thy hand upon me.","Nangin ka hnungtieng le ka hmatieng i mîn huol a, Ka chungah i kut în nghat bawk a."
6,"Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain unto it.","Chuong ang lâwma hrietna chu ka ta dingin a mak taluoh a, Ân sâng bêk a, ka phâk naw a nih."

8,"If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.","Vânah hang lâwn lang, chutaka chun i um sih a! Seolah zâlna siem lang, ngai ta, chutaka chun i um bawk sih a!"
9,"If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;",Zîngkâr thlahai zârin Tuisuoriet tâwp daiah va um lang;
10,"Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me.","Chutaka khawm chun i kutin mi ṭhuoi a ta, I kut changtiengin a mi chel âwm sih a."
11,"If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me, And the light about me shall be night;","“Matheiloin, inthimin mîn khum zo a ta, Ka vêla var hi zân nîng a tih,” ti ding ni lang,"
12,"Even the darkness hideth not from thee, But the night shineth as the day: The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.","Inthim khawma nangma kuoma chun iengkhawm a hlie nawh a, Zân hi sûn angin a var lem a nih: I ta ding chun inthim le var hi thuhmun zing a nih."
13,For thou didst form my inward parts: Thou didst cover me in my mother’s womb.,"Nangma ngeiin ka lungril i nei a, Ka nu phîng sûngah i mîn khum a."
14,I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: Wonderful are thy works; And that my soul knoweth right well.,"I kuomah lâwmthu hril ka ti che, ṭiumtak le maktaka siem ka ni sih a, I thilthawhai hi maktak a na, Chu chu ka hringna hin a hriet chieng hle a nih."
15,"My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret, And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.","Arûka siema ka um a, Hnuoi hmun inhnuoitaka mawi- taka siema ka um lai khan, Ka rurêl chu i kuomah thupin a um nawh a,"
16,"Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance; And in thy book they were all written, Even the days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was none of them.","Ka riruong la famkim lo chu i mitin a hmuh a, I lekhabua chun ka pênghai hi ziek vawng a nih: A ni têla siemin a um pei a, A pakhat khawm a la um hmain."
17,"How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!","Aw Pathien, i ngaituonahai chu ka ta dingin a va hlu de! A hung insukkhâwm chu a va nasa âwm de!"
18,"If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee.","Tiem ding ni lang, a tam tieng chu phaiphin nêkin tam lem a tih: Ka hang meng chun, i kuomah ka la um ta rawp hlak a nih."
19,"Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.","Aw Pathien, mi rilohai chu that ngei i tih, Chuongchun, nangni thisen insuo inhâwkhai, mi mâksan ro."
20,"For they speak against thee wickedly, And thine enemies take thy name in vain.","Anni chun suoltakin an hrilsiet si cheh a, Nangma dotuhai chun i hming chu an hril nawmna hlak."
21,"Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?","Aw Lalpa, nangma theidatuhai chu ka theida naw am a nih? Nangma thawtuhai chunga chun ka lungninaw naw am a nih?"
22,I hate them with perfect hatred: They are become mine enemies.,"Anni chu theida taktêin ka theidah a, A mi dotuhaiah ka ruot tâwl a."
23,"Search me, O God, and know my heart: Try me, and know my thoughts;","Aw Pathien, nguntakin mi en suok la, ka lungril hi hre rawh, Mi fie la, ka ngaituonahai hi hre rawh."
24,"And see if there be any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.","Chun, keimaa hin rîtlona kawng hrim hrim a um le a um naw en la, Chatuon lampuia chun mi ṭhuoi rawh."
