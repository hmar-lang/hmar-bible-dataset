1,Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.,"LALPA chu inpâk ro, LALPA kuoma chun lâwm- thu hril ro, ama chu a ṭha sih a; A ngilneina chun kumkhuo a dai sih a."
2,"Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?","Tu am LALPA thilthaw ropuitakhai hril thei a, Ama inpâkna po po inhriettir vawng thei le?"
3,"Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.","Rorêlna vawng ṭhahai chu an hamṭha ie, Ieng lai khawma feltaka thawtu leh."
4,"Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,","Aw LALPA, i mihai i ditsakna chun mi hre zing la, Aw i Sandamna leh mi hung kan rawh."
5,"That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.","I mi thlanghai tluongtlungzie ka hmu thei a, I hnamhai lâwmnaa chun ka hlim thei a, I rochanhai le ka sawng theina dingin."
6,"We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.","Kan thlatuhai le khan thil kan suksuol a, Thil suol kan thawh a, suoltakin kan thaw tah a."
7,"Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.","Kan thlatuhai khan Aigupta rama khan i thilmak thaw- hai kha an hriet thiem nawh a, I ngilneina nasatak kha an hriet zing ta nawh a, Tuisuorietah an hel ta lem a, Tuisuoriet Sena khan."
8,"Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.","Chuong sa khawm chun ama hming leiin anni chu a sandam tah a, A thilthawtheina ropuitak chu ân hriettir theina dingin."
9,"He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.","Tuisuoriet Sen chu a hal a; chuongchun, a kang tah a, Chuongchun, anni chu thlalêra ṭhuoi tlang ang elin tui inthûktakahai chun a ṭhuoi tlang tah a."
10,"And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.","Anni theidatu kuta inthawk chun a sandam a, Hmêlma kuta inthawk chun ân tlan tah a."
11,And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.,"Tuihai chun anni dotuhai chu ân khum zo a, Pakhat khawm dama suok an um ta nawh a."
12,Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.,"Chuong lai chun a thuhai chu an ring a, Ama inpâkna hla an sak a."
13,"They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,","Nisienlakhawm, a thilthaw- hai chu an theinghil vak tah a, A remruot chu an nghâk pei nawh a."
14,"But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.","Thlalêra chun thil an châk êm êm a, Ram ṭâwla chun Pathien an fie ta lem a."
15,"And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.","An thil hni chu a pêk a, Nisienlakhawm, an hringnaa chun chêrna ân lûttir a,"
16,"They envied Moses also in the camp, And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.","An riebûka chun Mosie chu an îtthîk a, LALPA mi inthieng, Aron leh."
17,"The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.","Hnuoi chu a kah a, Dathan chu a lem a, Abiram pâwlhai chu ân khum zo tah a."
18,And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.,"An pâwl lai chun mei sukchawkin a um a, Meichawk chun mi rilohai chu a kâng hmang tah a."
19,"They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.","Horeb tlânga chun bâwngte lim an siem a, A lim sung chu an biek tah a."
20,Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.,"Chuong ang chun an ropuina chu, Bâwngchal hlobet fa mi ang chauah an inchangtir tah a."
21,"They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,","Pathien an sandamtu an theinghil tah a, Aigupta rama thil ropuitak tak thawtu chu;"
22,"Wondrous works in the land of Ham, And terrible things by the Red Sea.","Ham rama thilmaktakhai, Tuisuoriet Sen panga thil râpthlâktakhai thawtu chu."
23,"Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.","Chuleiin, sukbohmang rawi a tih, tia, a lunginsen sukkîr dingin, A mi thlang Mosie chu a lûtna dinga chun a hmaah ngîr naw sien lem chu, Sukbohmang a tih, ti a hril a."
24,"Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,","Anih, ram ditumtak chu an ngainêp a, A thu chu an ring nuom nawh a."
25,"But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.","An puon inahai chun an chier ta lem a, LALPA râwl chu an ngai nuom nawh a."
26,"Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,","Chuleiin anni tieng chun a kut a phar a, Anni chu thlalêra sukthlûkna ding le,"
27,"And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.","An chi thla dinghai chu hnam tin lai a sukthlûk a, Ram tina a sukdarna dingin."
28,"They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.","Baal-peor tieng chun an kawp a, Mithi kuoma thilinhlânhai chu an fâk ve tah a."
29,Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.,"Chuongchun, an thilthawhaiin ama chu an suklungsen a, Chuongchun, hri chu an chungah a hung inlêng tah a."
30,"Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.","Chuong lai chun Phinehas chu a ngîr a, ro a rêl a; Chuongchun, hri chu sukboin a um tah a."
31,"And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.","Chu chu a felnaa ruot a nih, Kumkhuoin suon po po chenin."
32,"They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;","Meriba tuiahai khawm chun ama chu an suklungsen a, Chuongchun, anni leiin Mosie chungah thil ṭha naw a tlung ta hiel a,"
33,"Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.","A thlarau chungah an hel a, A hmûra ṭha nawtaka a hril leiin."
34,"They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,","LALPAIN an kuoma sukbo- hmangna thu a pêk angin, Mipuihai chu an sukbohmang nawh a."
35,"But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,","Hnam tin chu an pâwl a, An thilthawhai chu an inchûk lem a."
36,"And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.","A milim rawnghai an bâwl a, Chuong chu an ta dingin châng a lo ni tah."
37,"Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,","Anih, khawhri kuoma chun an naupasalhai le an naunu- hmeihaiin an inthâwi a;"
38,"And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.","Thisen pawitâwklo, an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai thisen ngei chu an insuo tah a, Chuonghai chun Kanaan ram milimhai kuomah an inthâwi a, Chu ram chu thisenin a lo pawrche tah a."
39,"Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.","Chuongchun, an sinthawhaia sukkhawloin an um tah a, An thilthawhaia chun an hung uire tah a."
40,"Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.","Chuleiin, LALPA lung chu a mihai chungah ân thawk a, A rochan chu a tirdak tah a."
41,And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.,"Chuongchun, anni chu hnam tin kutah a pêk a, Anni theidatuhai chun an chungah ro an rêl tah a."
42,"Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.","Anni dotuhaiin an nêksâwr a, An kut hnuoia chun suktlâwmin an um tah a."
43,"Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.","Vawi tamtak anni chu a san- dam a, Nisienlakhawm, an remruotnaa chun an hel hlak a, An rîtlonaa chun sukhnuoiin an um tah a."
44,"Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:","Chuong sa khawm chun, ama chun an khêkri chu a hriet chun, An lunginzîng chu a ngaisak a."
45,"And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.","A thuthlung chu anni a hrietpêk zing a, A ngilneina nasatzie ang peiin a lungril ân lêt tah a."
46,He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.,"Sala ṭhuoituhai po po chu, Anni a lunginsiettir a."
47,"Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.","Aw LALPA, kan Pathien, mi sandam la, Hnam tin laia inthawk hi mi ṭhuoi khawm rawh: I hming inthieng kuoma lâwmthu hril ding le, Nangma inpâkna chawimawi dingin."
48,"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.","LALPA Israel Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se. Chatuona inthawka chatuon chenin. Mi po po chun, “Amen,” ti raw se; LALPA chu inpâk ro."
