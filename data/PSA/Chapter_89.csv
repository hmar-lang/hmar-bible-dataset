50,"Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; How I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples,","LALPA, i siehlawhai an hrilsietna chu hre zing la, Hnam hrâttakhai po po hrilsietna ka ângsûnga ka tuor hlakzie hi."
51,"Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.","Aw LALPA, nangma dotuhai hrilsietna, I hrieknâl kehnunghai an hrilsietna chu."
52,"Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Amen, and Amen.","LALPA chu kumkhuoin inpâkin um raw se. Amen, Amen."
