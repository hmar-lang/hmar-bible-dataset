1,"Except Jehovah build the house, They labor in vain that build it: Except Jehovah keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain.","LALPAIN in a bâwl naw chun, A bâwltuhai chu an inrim thlâwn el a nih: LALPAIN khawpui a vawngṭha naw chun, A vêngtu chu a meng thlâwn el a nih."
2,"It is vain for you to rise up early, To take rest late, To eat the bread of toil; For so he giveth unto his beloved sleep.","Zîngkâr in tho va, inhnutakin in châwl a, Sininrimna bu in fâk hlak hi, in ta dingin a thlâwn el a nih. Hieng ang hin a mi dittak chu a ininnghiltir hlak a nih."
3,"Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah; And the fruit of the womb is his reward.","Ngai ta, nau le têhai hi LALPAA inthawka ei rochan an na, Rîla ra hi a lâwmman mi pêk a nih."
4,"As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth.","Vânglai nauhai chu, Mi hrât kuta thal umhai ang hi an nih."
5,"Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.","A thal bâwm naua sip nei mi chu lâwmtakin a um hlak a nih: Kul kawtkhâra an dohai an biek lai khawmin, Muolpho naw ni hai."
