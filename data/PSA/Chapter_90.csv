1,"Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations.","LALPA nang chu suon po po chena kan umna i ni hlak,"
2,"Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.","Tlânghai insieng hmaha, Leihnuoi le khawvêl în ngîr hma khawm khan, Chatuona inthawka chatuon chenin nang chu Pathien i nih."
3,"Thou turnest man to destruction, And sayest, Return, ye children of men.","Nang chun mihriem hi bohmangnaa în fetir hlak a, “Mihriem nauhai, kîr nâwk ro,” i ti hlak."
4,"For a thousand years in thy sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.","Nanga ngai chun kum sâng khat hi, Zâni bo ta ang chau kha a na, Zân vêng khat sûng ang chau bawk a nih."
5,Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.,"Anni chu tui lien angin i lên hmang hlak a, ṭhang khat in ang chau an nih. Zîngkâr chun hlobet inder suok ang an nih."
6,"In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.","Zîngkâr chun a hung innoin a hung inder suok a, Zântieng chun ât thlûkin a um a, a vuoi hlak."
7,"For we are consumed in thine anger, And in thy wrath are we troubled.","I lunginsennaa sukbohmangin kan um a, I lungawi nawnaa suklungzîngin kan um bawk sih a."
8,"Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.","Kan rîtlonahai chu i hmaah i sieh a, Kan suol iprûkhai chu i hmêl varah i sie tah a."
9,For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: We bring our years to an end as a sigh.,"Kan dam sûng ni po po hi i lunginsennaah a bo hlak, Kan dam sûng kumhai hi tienami angin kan suktâwp hlak."
10,"The days of our years are threescore years and ten, Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow; For it is soon gone, and we fly away.","Kan dam sûng kumhai chu kum sâwmsari a na, Hrâtna leiin kum sâwmriet khawm a ni thei. Nisienlakhawm, a sâwtna chu sininrimna le lungngaina chau a nih; A bo vak a, keini khawm kan vuong hmang hlak a ni hi."
11,"Who knoweth the power of thine anger, And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?","Tuin am i lunginsenna thilthawtheizie hreha, Nangma ṭi dingzie anga i lunginsenna hrie le?"
12,"So teach us to number our days, That we may get us a heart of wisdom.","Kan dam sûng nihai tiem dân ding mîn chûktir la, Varna lungril kan nei pha hielna dingin."
13,"Return, O Jehovah; how long? And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.","Aw LALPA hung kîr nâwk la, ieng chen am i lunginsen ding a na? I siehlawhai chungthua chun i lungril inlêt rawh."
14,"Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.","Aw, zîngkâr chun i ngilneinain mi suktlai la, Kan dam sûng po po hin kan hlima kan lâwm theina dingin."
15,"Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, And the years wherein we have seen evil.","Nangin i mi sukrimsik ni le, Thil ṭha naw kan tuok kum sûng hu ang khan mi suklâwm rawh."
16,"Let thy work appear unto thy servants, And thy glory upon their children.","I sinthaw chu i siehlawhai kuomah inlang sienla, I ropuina chu an nauhai kuomah inlang raw se."
17,"And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.","Chun, LALPA kan Pathien mawina chu kan chungah um raw se: Kan kut sinthaw hi kan chungah sukdet bawk la, Anih, kan kut sinthaw hi sukdet rawh."
