1,"Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith: The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.","LALPA chu lalah a ṭhung a, a ropuinain ân thuom a, LALPA chu ân thuom a, hrât- nain a kâwngah ân khit tah a: Khawvêl khawm hi ân hnîng thei nawna dingin sukdetin a um a."
2,Thy throne is established of old: Thou art from everlasting.,"I lalṭhungpha chu tiena inthawka lo sukdet tah a na, Nang chu chatuona um tah i nih."
3,"The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.","Aw LALPA, vadungpuihai chun an insuoh a, Vadungpuihai chun an râwl an insuoh a. Vadungpuihai chun an ri nasatak chu an insuoh a."
4,"Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty.","Tui tamtakhai râwl nêkin, Tuisuoriet fâwn hrâttakhai nêk khawmin, Chungtienga LALPA chu a hrât a nih."
5,"Thy testimonies are very sure: Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.","I thuinhriettirhai chu ring a um êm êm a, Aw LALPA, kumkhawtluongin, Inthiengna hi i in leh ân mawi a nih."
