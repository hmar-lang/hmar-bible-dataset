2,"They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor: With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.","Mi tin chun an vênghai kuomah thu teplo mei mei an hril hlak sih a; Mi inpâk tehlêmna hmûr le, hlêmna lungril putin thu an hril hlak a;"

7,"Thou wilt keep them, O Jehovah, Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever.","Aw LALPA, anni chu nangin vawng ṭhâng i ta, Hieng ṭhangtharhaia inthawk hin kumkhuoin humhim tâng i tih."
