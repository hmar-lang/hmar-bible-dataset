1,"I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.","Aw LALPA ka hrâtna, ka hmangai che."
2,"Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.","LALPA chu ka lungpui le, ka kulpui le a mi sanhimtu a nih; Ka Pathien, ka lungpui dettak a nih, amaa chun ka ringna innghat ka tih; Ka phaw le, ka sandamna ki le, ka kulbîng insâng a nih."
3,"I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.","Inpâktlâk LALPA chu ko ka ta, Chuongchun, a mi dotuhaia inthawkin sanhimin um ka tih."
4,"The cords of death compassed me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.","Thina hruihruolhai chun a mi zem a, Pathien ngaisak nawna tuilienhai chun a mi sukṭi bawk a."
5,The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.,"Seol hruihruolhai chun a mi khuop tlat a, Thina chânghai chun a mi âwk a;"
6,"In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears.","Ka lunginzîngin LALPA chu ka ko hlak a, Ka Pathien ka ko hlak; Ama chun a biekina inthawk chun ka râwl chu a hriet a, A hmaha ka khêkri chu a naah a lût tah a."
7,"Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.","Chu phingle chun hnuoi hi ân hnîng a, ân thin tah a, A lunginsen leiin tlânghai khawm chu, Ân nghatna pumin ân thinin ân hnîng tah a."
8,"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.","A hnâra inthawk chu meikhu ân tung ta ngut ngut a, A baua suok mei chun a kâng ta dur dur a; Chu chun meihawl khawm chu a sukchawk ta hum hum a."
9,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.","Ama chun vânhai khawm chu ân kûntir a, a ṭum tah a. A ke hnuoia chun inthim sâmup hi a hung um tah a."
10,"And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.","Cherub chungah a chuong a, a vuong tah a; Anih, thli thlaahai chun a vuong thuok thuok a."
11,"He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.","Inthim hi ân bîkhmangna hmunah, ama inhuol vêlna bûktêah a siem a, Tuia inthimna vâna sûm sâmuphai chu."
12,"At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.","A hmaa vara inthawk chun a sûm sâmuphai chu an inkieng a, Ṭêk le rielhai chu a tla ta ur ur a"
13,"Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.","LALPA chu vânahai khin ân ri ta dur dur bawk a, Achunghnungtak chun a râwl ân suoh a, Rielso le ṭêk mei inhlap ri ân ri rum rum a"
14,"And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.","Chun, a thalhai chu a kâp suok a, anni chu a sukdar a, Anih, kâwlhai ân leptir zawt zawt zing a, a sukbuoi tâwl tah a."
15,"Then the channels of waters appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.","Chu phingleh, Aw LALPA, i kâwkna leiin, I hnâra inthuok suok chun a mût rak leiin, Tui luongnahai chu a hung inlang a; Leilung innghatna chu suklangin a um tah a."
16,"He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters.","Ama chun chungtienga inthawkin a hung ban a, a mi chel a; Tui tamtaka inthawk chu a mi kei suok tah a."
17,"He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.",A mi dotu hrâttaka inthawk chun a mi sanhim tah a; A mi theidatuhaia inthawk khawmin; Keia ta ding chun an hrât talaw sih a.
18,They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.,"Anni chun ka vângduoi ni chun an mi thawh a, Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chu ka sawng tak a nih."
19,"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.","Ama chun hmun inthâwltakah a mi ṭhuoi suok a, Ka chungah a lâwm leiin a mi lo sanhim tah a nih."
20,Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.,"LALPA chun ka felzie ang ngeiin ka chungah a thawh a, Ka kuthai ân thieng ang ngeiin a mi thung a nih."
21,"For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.","LALPA lampuihai chu ka hrawh a, Ka Pathien kuoma inthawkin rilotakin ka fe hmang ngai si nawh a."
22,"For all his ordinances were before me, And I put not away his statutes from me.","A dânhai po po ka hmaah a um hlak a, A thuruothai chu ka pei ngai si nawh a."
23,"I was also perfect with him, And I kept myself from mine iniquity.","Ama kuoma chun demkailo ka lo na, Ka khawhlonaa inthawk chun kân siekieng hlak."
24,"Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun ka felzie ang peiin a mi thung tah a, Ka kuthai a mithmuah ân thieng ang peiin."
25,With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;,"Mi lunginsietthei tak kuoma chun lunginsietthei takin insuklang i ta, Mi ṭha famkim kuoma chun ṭha famkimin insuklang i tih."
26,With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.,"Mi inthieng kuoma chun inthiengin insuklang i ta, Chun, mi kâwmaw kuoma chun kâwmaw takin insuklang i tih."
27,For thou wilt save the afflicted people; But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.,"Rinum tuor mihai chu i sandam ding a ni sih a, Mi chapohai ruok chu suktlâwm i tih."
28,For thou wilt light my lamp: Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.,"Nangin ka khâwnvar hi i mi sitpêk ding a ni sih a, LALPA ka Pathien chun kân thimna hi sukvar a tih."
29,For by thee I run upon a troop; And by my God do I leap over a wall.,"Nangma iṭhangpuiin, râl ka baw sih a, Ka Pathien ṭhangpui bawkin kul bang chu châwm hlîm ka tih."
30,"As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.","Pathien chu a lampui chu a ṭhafamkim a, LALPA thu chu fie a ni tah a, Amaha ringna innghattuhai po po ta ding chun ama chu phaw a nih."
31,"For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, besides our God,",LALPA naw chu tu am Pathien a um a? Ei Pathien naw chu tu am lungpui a um a?
32,"The God that girdeth me with strength, And maketh my way perfect?","Hrâtnaa ka tâia mi khittu le, Ka lampui sukṭha famkimtu Pathien chu."
33,He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: And setteth me upon my high places.,"Ama chun ka ke hi sazukpui ke angin a siem a, Ka hmun insângtakahai a min umtir hlak a."
34,He teacheth my hands to war; So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.,"Ka kuthai hi râl kâp dingin ân chûktir hlak a, Chuongchun, ka bânhai hin dâr thalngul a kuoi zo hiel a."
35,"Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy right hand hath holden me up, And thy gentleness hath made me great.","Nangin i sandamna phaw chu i mi pêk bawk a: I kut changtiengin i mi kei a, I inngaitlâwmna chun a mi siem lien tah a."
36,"Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.","Ka hnuoia ka kalchawina chu i suklien a, Chuongchun, ka kehai hi ân tleu nawh."
37,"I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.","A mi dotuhai chu hnawt ka ta, hnawt phâk el ka tih, Sukbohmanga an um hmakhat chun nghakîr ta naw bawk ka tih."
38,"I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise: They shall fall under my feet.","An tho nâwk thei nawna dingin sât sawk ka ta, Ka ke hnuoia hin tlu tâwl an tih."
39,For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.,"Nangin inthawnaa ding chun hrâtnain ka tâiah i mi khit a, A mi hung thawtuhai chu ka hnuoiah i suktlâwm tah a."
40,"Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.","A mitheidatuhai chu ka sukbohmang theina dingin, Nangin a mi dotuhai chu hnung mîn nghatin în umtir ta bawk a."
41,"They cried, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.","Anni chu an khêk a, nisienla- khawm, sandamtu ding tukhawm an um si nawh, LALPA ngei chu an ko va, nisienlakhawm, a dawn si nawh."
42,Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.,"Chu phingleh, pilvut thli ilên ang el hin ka vuok nâwi neng a, Tuollaia chirhak ang el hin ka peihâwn tah a."
43,Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.,"Nangin mihai insuolnaa inthawk chun i mi sanhim tah a, Hnam tinhai lua chun i mi siem tah a. Ka hriet ngailo mihai chun ka rawng bâwl tâng an tih."
44,As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.,"Ka chanchin an hriet phingleh ka thu awi an ta, Hmêlmak mihai chu ka kuomah intuklût an tih."
45,"The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.","Hmêlmak mihai chu hung zuoi an ta, An kulbînga inthawk chun inthin pumin hung suok an tih."
46,"Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,","LALPA chu a hring zing a, ka lungpui chu inpâkin um raw se, A mi sandamtu Pathien chu chawimawiin um raw se."
47,"Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And subdueth peoples under me.","Phuba mi lapêktu le, Mi tin ka hnuoia suktlâwmtu Pathien ngei chu."
48,"He rescueth me from mine enemies; Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.","Ama chun a mi dotuhaia in- thawk chun a mi sansuok a, Anih, nangin a mi thawtuhai chungtieng chun i mi dawm kâng a, Mi nunrâwnga inthawk chun i mi sanhim hlak."
49,"Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.","Chuleiin, aw LALPA, hnam tin lai chun lâwmthu hril ka ti cheh a, I hming inpâkin hla sak bawk ka tih."
50,"Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.","Ama chun hnena ropuitak a lal siem kuoma chun a pêk hlak a, A hrieknâl chungah, David le a thlahai chung ngeia chun, Kumkhawtluongin a ngilneizie inlangtir a tih."
