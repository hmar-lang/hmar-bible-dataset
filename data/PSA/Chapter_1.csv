verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:","Mi rilohai remruot ang chu hraw loa, Mi suolhai lampuia khawm ngîr ngai loa, Hmusittuhai ṭhungphaa khawm ṭhung ngailo mi chu a hamṭha."
2,But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night.,"A lâwmna chu LALPA dânah a ni lem a, A dân thu chu a sûn a zânin a ngaituo hlak a."
3,"And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.","Ama chu tuiluong kâwla thing phun, A huntaka ra insuo hlak, A hna khawm vuoi ngailo ang hi a nih: A thilthaw taphawt chu hlawtling pei a tih."
4,"The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.","Mi rilohai ruok chu chuong ang chu an ni nawh a, Busi thliin a lênhmang hlak ang hi an ni lem a."
5,"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.","Chuleiin, mi rilohai chu rorêlna hmaa chun ngîr thei naw ni hai a, Mi suolhai khawm mi felhai inkhâwmnaa chun ngîr thei bawk naw ni hai."
6,For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.,"Lalpa chun mi felhai lampui chu a hriet sih a, Mi rilohai lampui ruok chu bohmang a tih."
