1,"Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, That delighteth greatly in his commandments.","LALPA chu inpâk ro, LALPA ṭi mi chu a hamṭha ie, a thupêkhaia nasataka lâwm mi chu."
2,His seed shall be mighty upon earth: The generation of the upright shall be blessed.,"A thlahai chu hnuoia hin hrâttakin um an ta, Mi indiktakhai suonhai chu malsâwmin um an tih."
3,Wealth and riches are in his house; And his righteousness endureth for ever.,"A ina chun sum le hausakna a um a, A felna chu kumkhawtluonga um ding a nih."
4,"Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.","Mi indik ta ding chun inthima chun var a hung suok a, Ama chu mi lunginsiet theitak, lainatnaa sip, feltak a nih."
5,Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth; He shall maintain his cause in judgment.,"Mi lunginsieta inpûktir hlak mi chu ṭhatin a vur hlak a, Ama chu feltakin khawsâng a tih."
6,For he shall never be moved; The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.,"Iengtika khawm ân hnîng âwm si nawh a, Mi fel chu kumkhuoa hriet zingin um a tih."
7,"He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.","Chanchin ṭha nawtakhai ṭi naw nih a, LALPA chu ringin a lungril chu a det a nih."
8,"His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, Until he see his desire upon his adversaries.","A lungril chu a det a, ṭi naw nih, Ama dotuhai chunga a duthusâm tlung chu a hmu hmakhat chu."
9,"He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy; His righteousness endureth for ever: His horn shall be exalted with honor.","A semdar a, pasiehai kuomah a pêk a, A felna chu kumkhuoa um ding a nih; A ki chawimawinaa chawimawiin um a tih."
10,"The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: The desire of the wicked shall perish.","Mi rilo chun chu chu hmûng a ta, lunginsen a tih, A ha râwt a ta, intuihmang a tih: Mi rilohai dit zâwng chu bohmang a tih."
