1,"Save me, O God; For the waters are come in unto my soul.","Aw Pathien, mi sandam rawh, Tuihai chu ka rînga chen hin a lût ta sih a."
2,"I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.","Chirhak inthûktak, sirsan hrim hrim um nawnaah ka tlum duok duok hi, Tui inthûktak, tui lien a mi chîm tlumnaahai, ka lo lût ta hi."
3,I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.,"Ka khêkna leiin ka chau a, ka dang a ṭâwl zo tah a: Ka Pathien ka nghâknaa hin ka mit ân vai zo tah a."
4,"They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore.","A san boa a mi theidatuhai chu ka samzai nêkin an tam lem a, Indiknawtaka mi doa, mi sukbohmang tumtuhai chu mi hrâttak an nih, Kân rûk dêr naw khawm an min rultir a."

6,"Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.","Aw LALPA, sipaihai Pathien, nangma nghâktuhai chu keia leiin muolpho naw hai sienla, Aw Israelhai Pathien, nangma zawngtuhai che chu keima leiin sukzakin um naw raw hai se."
7,Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; Shame hath covered my face.,Nangma leia hrilsiet ka tuor leiin. Inzaknain ka hmai ân khum zo tah.
8,"I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my mother’s children.","Ka unauhai laia chun mikhuol ka hung ni tah a, Ka nu nauhai kuoma chun hriet ngailo mi ka lo ni tah a."
9,For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.,"I ina ka ṭhahnemngainain a mi fâk zo a, Nangma hrilsetuhai hrilsietnahai chu ka chungah a tla zo tah."
10,"When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach.","Ka ṭap a, bu nghei puma ka hringna ka thunun leh, Chu chu an mi hrilsietna a hung ni pei a."
11,"When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword unto them.","Ka silfêna saiip ka hmang leh, An ta dingin a se tienga hrilkhina ka hung ni pei a."
12,They that sit in the gate talk of me; And I am the song of the drunkards.,"Kul kawtkhâra ṭhunghai chun ka chungchâng thu an hril a, Zu inrui hmanghai hla ka ni hi."
13,"But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA, kei chun chu hun lâwmumah, i kuomah a nih ka ṭawngṭâi chu; Aw Pathien, i ngilneina nasatak leiin, I sandamna thutak chun mi hung dawn rawh."
14,"Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.","Chirhaka inthawk hin mi sanhim la, mîn tlumtir lul naw rawh. A mi theidatuhaia inthawk le, tui inthûktaka inthawk hi sanhimin mîn umtir rawh."
15,"Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, Neither let the deep swallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.","Tui lienin mi chîm tlum naw sienla, Tui inthûktak hin mi lem bawk naw raw se; Khursûng khawmin a bau mîn chîpnel naw raw se."
16,"Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.","Aw LALPA, mi hung dawn la, i ngilneina chu a ṭha si a, I lainatna nasat ang peiin keia tieng hi hung ngha la."
17,And hide not thy face from thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily.,"I siehlaw kuoma hin i hmai khawm thup naw la, Ka lunginzîng sih a, mi hung dawn vak rawh."
18,"Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of mine enemies.","Ka hringna hi hung hnaiin intlan la, A mi dotuhai lei hin nangin mi sanhim rawh."
19,"Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: Mine adversaries are all before thee.","Nangin mi mi hrilsietna dâm, ka muolphona dâm, kân zakna dâm, hi i hriet a. A mi dotuhai chu i hmaah an um vawng a nih."
20,"Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.","Mi mi hrilsietna hin lungriem- in a mi thlâk a, nasatakin ka lungngai bawk a, Chuongchun, a mi lunginsiettu ding ka zawng a; nisienlakhawm, tukhawm an um si nawh; A mi thlamuontu dinghai ka zawng a; nisienlakhawm, tukhawm ka hmu si nawh."
21,They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.,"Ka bu dingin thil kha an mi pêk nâwk nghâl a, Ka dang a châr hlakin uoin thûr dâwn dingin an mi pêk a,"
22,"Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, let it become a trap.","An hmaa an dawkân chu châng lo ni sienla, Lungmuongtaka an um laiin bil lo ni raw se."
23,"Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake.","An mithai chu an hmu theinawna dingin sukthimin hung um sienla, An kâwnghai chu sukthin rawp rawh."
24,"Pour out thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.","I lungninawna nasatak chu an chungah bunthla la, I lunginsen ṭiumna chun anni chu man raw se."
25,Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.,"An umna chu hung ṭâwp sienla, An puon inahai chun tukhawm um naw raw se."
26,For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.,"I ivuok chu an suknawmnah a, I înhliemhai lungngaizie chu an hril si hlak a."
27,Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into thy righteousness.,"An rîtlona chu rîtlonain belsa la, Anni chu i felnaa chun lût naw raw se."
28,"Let them be blotted out of the book of life, And not be written with the righteous.","Anni chu hringna bua inthawk chun thaihmangin um hai sienla, Mi felhai laia chun ziek ni ve naw raw hai se."
29,"But I am poor and sorrowful: Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.","Nisienlakhawm, kei chu rimsitak le lungngaitak ka na, Aw Pathien, i sandamna chun hmun insângah mi sie raw se."
30,"I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving.","Pathien hming chu hlain inpâk ka ta, Lâwmthu hrilin ama chu chawimawi ka tih."
31,"And it will please Jehovah better than an ox, Or a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.","Chuong ang chun, bâwngchal amanih, ki le tin nei bâwngchal nêk chun, LALPA suklâwm lem a tih."
32,"The meek have seen it, and are glad: Ye that seek after God, let your heart live.","Mi rimsihai chun chu chu an hmuh a, an lâwm a, Nangni Pathien zawngtuhai, in lungril chu hringin um raw se."
33,"For Jehovah heareth the needy, And despiseth not his prisoners.","LALPAIN pasiehai chu a bengkhawn a, A mi intânghai chu a hmusit si nawh a."
34,"Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moveth therein.",Hnuoi le vân chun ama chu inpâk raw se; Tuisuoriet le an sûnga thil châng thei taphawthai leh.
35,"For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.","Pathienin Zion chu sansuokin, Juda khuohai chu a siem ding a ni sih a, Chuongchun, chutaka chun um an ta, nei nghâl an tih."
36,The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; And they that love his name shall dwell therein.,"A siehlawhai thlahai khawm chun hluosâwng an ta, A hming ngainatuhai chu a sûngah um an tih."
