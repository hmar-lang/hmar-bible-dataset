1,"Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God endureth continually.","Aw mi hrât, iengdinga thil suksuol i sawng am a na? Pathien zaidamna chu a um zing hlak a nih."
2,"Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.","Thil suol tak thaw i suongtuo hlak a, I lei chu rêpvâw chem ngeitak ang a na, Khêlhlip a sâksuok hlak."
3,"Thou lovest evil more than good, And lying rather than to speak righteousness. [Selah","Ṭhat nêkin suol i ngaina lem a, Thu indiktak hril nêkin khêlthu hril i ngaina lem bawk a."
4,"Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.","Aw, nang lei mi hlêmnghal, Thu mi lem zo thei po po chu i ngaina hlak."
5,"God will likewise destroy thee for ever; He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out of the land of the living. [Selah","Pathien chun kumkhawtluonga dingin sukse vêng a ti che, Man a ti cheh a, i umnaa inthawkin kei dawk a ti cheh a, Mi hring rama inthawk hin kei suok dai a ti che."
6,"The righteous also shall see it, and fear, And shall laugh at him, saying,","Mi felhai khawmin an hmu chun ṭîng an ta, Nuisan an tih."
7,"Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness.","“En ta u, hi mi hi a nih, Pathien a kulbînga siem nuom lo a, A hausakna nasatak ring lem a, A suolnaa insukhrât vei chu,” tiin."
8,"But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.","Kei ruok chu chu Pathien ina oliv thing inder hlut hlut ang ka na, Pathien zainêmna chu kum- khawtluongin ring ka tih."
9,"I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it; And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.","Chu chu i thaw leiin kumkhuoin lâwmthu hril ka ti cheh a, I mi inthienghai mithmua chun i hming chu nghâk zing ka tih, a ṭha sih a."
