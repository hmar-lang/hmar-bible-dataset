14,"I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I bowed down mourning, as one that bewaileth his mother.","Ka ruol amanih, ka unau amani chunga chun ka um dân ding ang takin ka um a; Kân lawn vêl chu khuo khawm ngha ngam loa ngûiin. Mi a nu ṭâtu angin sûnin ka kûn a."
15,"But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: The abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; They did tear me, and ceased not:","Nisienlakhawm, ka chan a sein anni chu an lâwm a, an inhâwr khâwm hiel a, Mi suol teplohai chu mi thaw dingin an inkhâwm a, chu chu ka lo hriet si nawh. Ma nuom loin an mi sawisa hrep a."

17,"Lord, how long wilt thou look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, My darling from the lions.","LALPA, nangin ieng chen am i en ding a na? Ka hringna hi suksiet an tumnaa inthawk chun sansuok la; Ka nei suntak hi sakeibakneia inthawk chun sansuok rawh."

19,Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.,"Ka hmêlmahai chun indiknaw- takin mi diriem naw raw hai se, Ieng ni loa a mi theidatuhai chu an mitin inbe naw bawk raw hai se."
20,For they speak not peace; But they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.,"Inremna thu hrim an hril si nawh a, Hi rama um ṭawk ṭawkin hlêmna thuhai an ngaituo lem a nih."
21,"Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me; They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.","Anih, an bauin an mi kâk khum puou a, “Chei! Chei! ei mit ngeiin ei hmu tah,” an tih a."
22,"Thou hast seen it, O Jehovah; keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.","Aw LALPA, nangin i hmuh a, tosan naw rawh, Aw LALPA, mîn hlat naw rawh."
23,"Stir up thyself, and awake to the justice due unto me, Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.","Ka Pathien le ka LALPA, ka ro rêl dingin, Anih, ka thuha mi ṭan ding- in, insukhar la, meng rawh."
24,"Judge me, O Jehovah my God, according to thy righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, i felna ang peiin ro mi rêlpêk la, Anni chun mi diriem naw raw hai se."
25,"Let them not say in their heart, Aha, so would we have it: Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.","An lungrilin, “Chei! chuong ang chu a ni annâwm ei dit chu,” ti naw raw se. “Ama chu ei lem zo tah,” ti naw bawk raw se."
26,Let them be put to shame and confounded together that rejoice at my hurt: Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me.,"Ka sietna chunga lâwmhai chu muolphotak le thuokdawng- takin um hai sienla, Ka chunga insuklienhai chu muolphona le inzakna insiltirin um raw se."
27,"Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause: Yea, let them say continually, Jehovah be magnified, Who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.","Ka felna chunga lâwmhai chu hlima khêkin lâwmtakin um sienla, Anih, “A siehlaw vângneina chunga lâwm hlak LALPA chu, Chawimawiin um raw se,” ti rawp raw hai se."
28,And my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness And of thy praise all the day long.,"Chuongchun, ka lei hin i felna thu hril a ta, Nangma inpâkna thu khawm sûnnithlâkin hril bawk a tih."
