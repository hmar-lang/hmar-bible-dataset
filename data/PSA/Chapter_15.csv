1,"Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?","LALPA, i puon ina chun tu am hung mikhuol a ta? I tlâng inthienga chun tu am hung um a ta?"
2,"He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart;","Indiktaka uma, feltaka thawha, A lungrila thu tak tak hril mi chu;"
3,"He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor;","A leia mi rêl ngailo, A ruol chunga khawm thil suksuol ngailo, A vênghai hming khawm hrilse ngailo mi chu."
4,"In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;","Hnâwla umhai chu hmusit a, LALPA ṭituhai ruok chu chawimawi hlak a, Mâni ta dinga pawi ding khawm inkhâma tiem ta chu sukdanglam ngailo;"
5,"He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.","A pung um dinga tangka inpûktir ngailo, A thiem lem thiemnaw inchangtir dinga thamna khawm la ngailo mi chu: Chuong thilthawtu chu iengtik khawm inhnîng naw ni."
