1,"Preserve me, O God; for in thee do I take refuge.","Aw Pathien, mi humhim rawh, nangmaa chun ka ringna kân nghat si hlak a."
2,"O my soul, thou hast said unto Jehovah, Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee.","LALPA kuoma chun, “Nang chu ka LALPA i na, Nangmaa naw chun thil ṭha hrim ka nei nawh,” ka tih a."
3,"As for the saints that are in the earth, They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.","Hnuoia mi inthieng umhai thua chu, Anni chu mi ṭha, ka lâwmna po po umnahai chu an nih."
4,"Their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another god: Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, Nor take their names upon my lips.","LALPAA pathien dang thleng- tuhai chu an lungngainahai la pung a tih, An thisen inhlân dâwn mihai chu dâwn ve naw ningah a, Ka hmûr khawma an hminghai lam bawk naw ning."
5,Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot.,"LALPA chu ka rochan ding le ka no chan ding chu a na, Nangin ka chanpuol i mi sukdetpêk hlak."
6,"The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage.","Inkhina hruihai chu hmun inhawitakhaiah ka puolin a tla ta hlau a nih, Anih, ro ṭhatak ka hluo tah a nih."
7,"I will bless Jehovah, who hath given me counsel; Yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons.","LALPA, rem mi ruotpêktu chu inpâk ka ta, Anih, zânahai chun ka lungrilin a mi thunun hlak."
8,"I have set Jehovah always before me: Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.","LALPA chu ka hmaah kân umtir rawp hlak a, Ka changtieng a um leiin inhnîng naw ning."
9,"Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: My flesh also shall dwell in safety.","Chuleiin, ka lungril hi a lâwm a, ka ropuina khawm a hlim a; Ka taksa khawm himtakin um a tih."
10,For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol; Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.,"Ka thlarau chu Seol kuomah i mâksan âwm si nawh a, I mi inthieng hi hmawnna hmu i phal âwm bawk si nawh a."
11,Thou wilt show me the path of life: In thy presence is fulness of joy; In thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.,"Nangin hringna lampui chu min hriettir i ta, I hmaa chun hlima sipliemna a um a; I kut changtienga chun kumkhaw lâwmna ding a um."
