1,"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!","Ngai ta, unauhai inngei diel diela um khâwm hi, A va ṭhain, a vân hawi de!"
2,"It is like the precious oil upon the head, That ran down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard; That came down upon the skirt of his garments;","Luha hriek hlutak, Khâkhmula luong thla, Aron khâkhmul ngeia luong thla a, A zakawfuol hmawra luong thla ang kha a nih."
3,"Like the dew of Hermon, That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion: For there Jehovah commanded the blessing, Even life for evermore.","Hermon daidaw Zion tlânghaia tla hlak ang hi a nih; Chutaka chun LALPA chun malsâwmna thu a pêk a, Kumkhuoa hringna dingin."
