1,"I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me.","Ka lei hin thil ka suksuol nawna dingin, Ka umdânhai hi vêng ṭhang ka ta; Mi rilohai ka hmaha an um sûng po, Ka bau hi hmûrkhitnain khit ka tih, ka tih a."
2,"I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred.","Chuongchun, to zingin ṭawng loin ka um a, A ṭha tienga khawm ka to zing a; Nisienlakhawm, ka lungngaina chu chawkthoin a um lem hman a."
3,My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned; Then spake I with my tongue:,"Ka phîng sûnga hin ka lungril chu a sa vut vut a; Ka ngaituo ka ngaituo chun mei chu a chawk suok a; Chun, ka lei hin thu ka hril tah a."
4,"Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.","“LALPA, ka tâwpna ding le ka dam chen ding chu, Iengtin am a na ti mîn hriettir la, Ka derdêpzie hi mîn hriettir rawh”."
5,"Behold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. [Selah","Ngai ta, ka dam chen hi kut- pha bawk chen chauin i siem a, Ka kum hi i mithmua chun ieng khawp khawm a ni nawh a; Mi tin an ṭhat lai tak khawmin an pumin iengkhawm an ni nawh."
6,"Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.","Mi tin hi hlim angin an lêng takmeu a, An buoi thlâwn takmeu a nih. Ro ân khâwl khâwm hlak a, a hluotu ding a hriet si nawh a."
7,"And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.","Chun, LALPA, tuhin ieng am a na ka nghâk chu? Nangmaah a nih ka beiseina a um chu."
8,Deliver me from all my transgressions: Make me not the reproach of the foolish.,"Ka bawsietna po poa inthawkin mi sansuok la, Mi invêt hrilsietin mîn umtir naw rawh."
9,"I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; Because thou didst it.","Nangma thaw a ni leiin, Ka ṭawng nawh a, ka bau ka ka bawk nawh."
10,Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.,"I mi vuokna hi ka kuoma inthawkin mi la hmangpêk la, I kutthlâka sukbohmang ka ni hi."
11,"When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely every man is vanity. [Selah","Mi a bawsietna leia kâwknahaia i thunun hin, A ditumna hi hângthim angin i suksiet hlak: Mi tin hi iengkhawm an ni nawh."
12,"Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; Hold not thy peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.","Aw LALPA, ka ṭawngṭâina hi ngai la, ka konaa hin na sit la, Ka mitthli tla hi tosan naw rawh: I mikhuol ka na, A mi thlatuhai po po ang khan khuolchâm el ka ni sih a."
13,"Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go hence, and be no more.","Aw, hitaka ka suok a, ka um naw sawng dai hma hin, Ka har nâwkna dingin mi hla rawh."
