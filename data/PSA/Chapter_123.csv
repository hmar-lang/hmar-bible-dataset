1,"Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that sittest in the heavens.","Aw, nang vâna ṭhung hlak, Nanga tieng ka mit ka hung inlên hlak."
2,"Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress; So our eyes look unto Jehovah our God, Until he have mercy upon us.","Ngai ta, siehlawhai mitin an pu kut tieng a en hlak ang le, Siehlawnu mitin a pi kut tieng a en hlak angin, Keini mit khawma LALPA kan Pathien kuom tieng a en zing a nih, Keini a mi lunginsiet hmakhat chun."
3,"Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us; For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.","Aw LALPA, mi lunginsiet rawh, mi lunginsiet rawh, Hmusitna kan tuor nasa taluo tah."
4,"Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scoffing of those that are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.","Mi inhawitirhai dêuna le, Chapohai hmusitnain, Kan hringna hi a sukchau sâwt taluo a nih."
