verse_no,en,hmr
1,"They that trust in Jehovah Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.","LALPA ringtuhai chu Zion tlâng sukhnîng ruol lo, kumkhawtluonga um zing ding ang chu an nih."
2,"As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So Jehovah is round about his people From this time forth and for evermore.","Tlânghai chu Jerusalem vêla a um angin, LALPA chu a mihai vêlah a um hlak, Tuta inthawka kumkhaw- tluongin."
3,For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.,"Rîtlona lalhmawl chu mi fel chan chunga chun ân nghat âwm si nawh a, Mi felhai chun an kuthaia khawhlona an ban nawna dingin."
4,"Do good, O Jehovah, unto those that are good, And to them that are upright in their hearts.","Aw LALPA, ṭhataka umhai chunga chun ṭhatakin thaw la, An lungril indiktaka umhai chunga khawm."
5,"But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.","An lampui kâwia pêthai ruok hi chu, LALPA chun thil suksuoltuhai leh ṭhuoi hmang a tih; Israelhai chunga chun thlamuongna um raw se."
