1,O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.,"Aw LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril ro, ama chu a ṭha sih a; A ngilneina khawm kumkhuoin a um ding a ni sih a,"
2,"Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,","LALPA mi intlanhai chun chuong ang chun hril raw se, Dotu kuta inthawka a întlan,"
3,"And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.","Ram tina inthawka a ṭhuoi khâwm, Sak le thlang, sim le hmâra inthawkhai dâm chun."
4,They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.,"Thlalêra ram ṭâwl lampuia chun an invâk an invâk a, Mihriem umna khuo hrim hrim an hmu nawh a."
5,"Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.","Phîngṭâm le dangchârin, An hringna chu an sûngah a chau tah a."
6,"Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,","Chu phingleh an buoinaa chun LALPA chu an ko tah a, Ama chun an lunginzîngnaa inthawk chun a sanhim a."
7,"He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.","Mihriem umna khuoa an fe theina dingin, Lampui tlûntakah a ṭhuoi tah a."
8,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!","Aw, mihriemhai hin LALPA chu a ngilneina lei le, Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilmak thawhai lei hin inpâk hai sien aw!"
9,"For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.","Ama chun hringna thil châk êm êm chu a sukkhawpin, Hringna phîngṭâm chu ṭhatnain a sukkhawp sih a."
10,"Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,","Inthim hnuoia le thina hlima ṭhung a, Rinumna le thîra khuophai chu;"
11,"Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:","Pathien thuhai chungah an hel a, Achunghnungtak remruot chu an ngainêp leiin."
12,"Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.","Ama chun an lungril chu inrimnain a sukhnuoi a, An tluh a, ṭhangpuitu ding hrim an um si nawh a."
13,"Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.","Chu phingleh an buoinaa chun LALPA chu an ko a, Ama chun an lungzîngnaa inthawk chun a sandam a."
14,"He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.","Inthim hnuoi le thina hlima inthawk chun a ṭhuoi suok a, An khuopnahai chu a suktan tah a."
15,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!","Aw mihriemhai hin LALPA chu a ngilneina lei le, Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilmak thawhai lei hin inpâk hai sien aw!"
16,"For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.","Ama chun dâr kawtkhârhai chu a suksiet a, A kalna thîrtluonhai chu a sukbawng ta sih a."
17,"Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.","Mi invêthai chu an bawsietna lei le, An rîtlonahai leiin an insukrinum hlak a."
18,Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.,"An hringna chun fâk ding tinrêng hi a tirdak hlak a, Thina kul kawtkhârhai chu an hnai hlak a."
19,"Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.","Chu phingleh an buoinaa chun LALPA chu an ko a, Ama chun an lungzingnaa inthawk chun a sandam hlak."
20,"He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth them from their destructions.","A thu chu a tirsuok a, anni chu a sukdam hlak a, An bohmangna dinghaia inthawk chun a sanhim hlak."
21,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!","Aw mihriemhai hin LALPA chu a ngilneina lei le, Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilmak thawhai lei hin inpâk hai sien chu aw!"
22,"And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.","Anni chun lâwmthu hrilna inthâwinahai chu inhlân hai sienla, A thilthawhai chu hlaa sakin hril raw hai se."
23,"They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;","Tuisuorieta lawng liena zu feh a, Tui lientak chunghaia sin thaw hlakhai chun,"
24,"These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep.","Chuonghai chun LALPA thilthawhai le, Tui inthûktaka a thilmak thawhai chu an hmu hlak."
25,"For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.","Ama chun thu a pêk a, thlipui ân hrângtir a, Chu chun a tuifâwnhai chu a suksâng hlak."
26,"They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.","Vân tieng an hung tuol tuol a, inthûktakah an ṭum nâwk tuol tuol hlak, Lunginzîngna leiin an hringna chu ân tuihmang hlak."
27,"They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits’ end.","Zurui angin an thle an thleh a, an pêm nawk nawk hlak a, Um ngaina hrim hrim an hriet ngai nawh."
28,"Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.","Chu phingleh an buoinaa chun LALPA chu an ko a, Ama chun an lungzîngnaa inthawk chun a ṭhuoi suok hlak."
29,"He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.","Thlipui chu a sukma ṭhuop a, Chuongchun, a tuifâwnhai a re ṭhup hlak."
30,Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.,"Chun, a re ta leiin an lâwm hlak a; Chuongchun, ama chun an ngaitak likilkawia chun a ṭhuoi tlung hlak."
31,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!","Aw, mihriemhai hin LALPA chu a zainêmna lei le Mihriem nauhai chunga a thilmak thawhai lei hin inpâk hai sien chu aw!"
32,"Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.","Anni chun mihai inkhâwmnaah ama chu inpâk sienla, Upahai ṭhungnaa chun inpâk raw se."
33,"He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;","Ama chun vadungpuihai chu thlalêrah ân changtir hlak a, Tuihnârhai chu hnuoi ṭâwlah ân changtir bawk hlak."
34,"A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.","Ram ṭha chu ram ṭâwl chawkah ân changtir hlak a, A sûnga umhai rîtlona leiin."
35,"He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.","Thlalêr chu dîlah ân changtir hlak a, Ram ṭâwl chu tuihnârahai ân changtir bawk hlak."
36,"And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,","Chutaka chun phîngṭâmhai chu ân umtir hlak a, Umna ding khuo an buotsai a."
37,"And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.","Lohai an nei a, grêp huonhai an siem a, A ra hung punghai chu an hmu theina dingin."
38,"He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.","Anni chu mal a sâwm hlak a, nasataka sukpungin an um a, An ranhai chu a kiem a phal ngai nawh a,"
39,"Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.","Chun, nêksâwrna dâm, rinum- na dâm, lungngai dâm leiin, An kiem ta sawt sawt a, an kûn ta thlawk thlawk a."
40,"He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.","Ama chun mi lienhai chungah hmusitna a bunthlâk hlak a, Thlalêr lampui hrim hrim um nawnaa chun ân vâktir ân vâktir a."
41,"Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh him families like a flock.","Nisienlakhawm, rimsihai chu rinumnaa inthawkin hmun insângah a dawm kai hlak a, Ran ruol angin sûnghai a siempêk hlak."
42,"The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.","Mi indiktakhai chun chu chu hmûng an ta, lâwm an tih, Rîtlona po po chun a bau hip a tih,"
43,Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.,"Tukhawm a var taphawt chun chuong chu vawng ṭhâng an ta, LALPA ngilneina chu ngaituong an tih."
