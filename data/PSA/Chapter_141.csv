1,"Jehovah, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.","LALPA, ka ko che hi, ka kuomah hung vak la, Ka ko chein ka râwlah i nâ lo sit rawh."
2,Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.,"Ka ṭawngṭâina hi thil riminhniktak angin i hmaah suksuokin um sienla, Ka kut phar hi zântienga inthawina angin um raw se."
3,"Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips.","Aw LALPA, ka bau bula hin vêngtu inhungtir la, Ka hmûr kawtkhâr hi vêng rawh."
4,"Incline not my heart to any evil thing, To practise deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity: And let me not eat of their dainties.","Rîtlona thilhai, Thil suksuol mihai thawpui dingin, Ka lungril hi thil ṭha naw tieng hrim hrima chun inthlêktir naw la, An fâk inhniktak takhai chu mîn fâktir bawk naw rawh."
5,"Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; And let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.","Mi fel chun mi vaw raw se, lunginsietna nîng a tih; Mi kâwk raw se, lua hriek nâl ang nîng a tih. Ka luin nuom naw naw raw se, An rîtlonahai leiin ka ṭawngṭai pei ding a ni sih a."
6,Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.,"An rorêltuhai chu lungpui sîra peithlâkin um an ta, Anni chun ka thuhai chu ngai tâng an ta, a thlum sih a."
7,"As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.","Miin hnuoi ân let a, a suknâwi ang hin, An ruhai hi thlân khoa suknâwiin a um a."
8,"For mine eyes are unto thee, O Jehovah the Lord: In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute.","Aw LALPA PATHIEN, ka mitin nanga tieng a en si hlak a, Nangmaa chun ka ringna kân nghat hlak; ka hringna hi saruokin mâksan naw rawh."
9,"Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.","Ka âwkna dinga châng an kama inthawk chun mi humhim la, Thil suksuoltuhai chânga inthawk leh."
10,"Let the wicked fall into their own nets, Whilst that I withal escape.","Keiin ka fe khêl laitakin, Mi rilohai chu anni lênahai chun tlulût raw se."
