9,"Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them.","I lungsen pha chun anni chu rawtuina mei chawk zur zur ang chun siem i ta, LALPA chun anni chu lunginsenin lem zo a ta, Mei chun kâng hmang el a tih."

13,"Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: So will we sing and praise thy power.","Aw LALPA, i hrâtnaa chun chawimawiin um la, Chuongchun, i thilthawtheina inpâkin hla sak kan tih."
