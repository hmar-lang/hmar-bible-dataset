1,"I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.","Ka farnu, ka huona chun ka hung ie, ka mo, Ka riminhnik leh ka murra chu ka lâk khâwm a; Ka khuoizu le ka khuoithlâr chu ka fâk a; Ka bâwng nênetui leh ka uoin chu ka dâwn tah. Nunghâk Aw ruolhai, fa ta u, Dâwn unla, dâwn ṭeu ro aw hmangaitak."
2,"I was asleep, but my heart waked: It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.","Ka lo in a, ka lung ruok chu a har a, Chu! ka hmangaitak chu a hung nâwk ie, Tlangvâl “Mi hung hawngpêk rawh, ka farnu, ka hmangai, ka vaṭhu, ka ṭha famkim; Ka lu chu daidâwin a sukhu a, Ka sam chu zân hnâwngin,” tiin. Nunghâk"
3,I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?,"Ka zakawchung chu ka hlîp tah a, iengtin am hâk nâwk ka ta? Ka kehai chu ka sâwp tah a, iengtin am sukbal nâwk ka ta?"
4,"My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, And my heart was moved for him.","Ka hmangaitak chun kawtkhâr âwnga chun a kut a hung pur a, Chun, ama ta dingin ka lungril chu a hung châng tah a."
5,"I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the bolt.","Ka hmangaitak chu hawngpêk dingin ka tho tah a, Ka kuthai chu murrain a far a, ka kutpârhai chu murra tuiin, Kawtkalna bâwk chunga chun."
6,"I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.","Ka hmangaitak chu ka hawngpêk a; Nisienlakhawm, ka hmangai- tak chu a lo intâwlhmang a, a lo fe hmang tah a, Thu a hung hril lai khan ka thlain a mîn âwimâwtir a; Ama chu ka zawng a, anachu ka hmu nawh a; Ama chu ka ko a, anachu a mi dawn nawh."
7,"The watchmen that go about the city found me, They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.","Vêngtuhai khawpuia fe vêlhai chun an mi hmuh a, An mi vuok a, an mi sukhliem a; Kul vêngtuhai chun ka puon lukhum an mi lâkpêk a."
8,"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, That ye tell him, that I am sick from love.","Aw Jerusalem naunuhai, ka ngên cheu, ka hmangaitak kha in hmu chun, Hmangainain ka na a nih, ti ama chu hril ro."
9,"What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved, That thou dost so adjure us?","I hmangaitak chu mi danghai hmangaitakhai leh a chuong a liemna, Aw nang nuhmeihai laia hmêlṭhatak, ieng am a um bîk a? I hmangaitak chu mi danghai hmangaitak le a chuong a liemna ieng am a um bîk a, Chuong ang lâwma i mi ngên chu? Nunghâk"

12,"His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, and fitly set.","A mithai chu vadungtê tui kâwla vaṭhu mithai ang a na, Nênetuia sâwp, inremtaka inbûk."
13,"His cheeks are as a bed of spices, As banks of sweet herbs: His lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.","A bienghai chu riminhnik bil, rim inhnik insuo hlak ang a na, A hmûrhai chu lili, murra tui infartir ang chu a nih."
14,His hands are as rings of gold set with beryl: His body is as ivory work overlaid with sapphires.,"A kuthai chu rângkachak tluon, berul lung phûm ang chu an na, A taksa chu saihaa siem, Sapphir lunga tuom ang a nih."
