6,"Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, Which are come up from the washing; Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them.","I hahai chu berâmpui ruol, Insilnaa inthawka hunghai ang chu a nih; A kawp kawpin an um seng a, Anni lai chun a tukhawm a khâtin an um nawh."

13,"Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, As upon the dance of Mahanaim?","Kîr rawh, kîr rawh, aw Shulam mi, Kîr rawh, kîr rawh, kan en theina ding chein; Nunghâk Mahanaim lâm en ang el chun, Iengdingin am Shulam mi chu en i ta? Tlangvâl"
