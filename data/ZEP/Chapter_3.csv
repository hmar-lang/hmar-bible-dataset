1,Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city!,"Khawpui nêksâwra um, sukpawr- chea um le hela um chu a chung a va rik de!"
2,She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.,"Ama chun râwl chu a pawisa nawh a, sukdikna chu a pawm nawh a, LALPA khawm chu a ring nawh a; a Pathien khawm chu a hung hnai bawk nawh a."
3,Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow.,A sûnga chun a mi ṭhahai chu sakeibaknei inrûm lai ang an na; a rorêltuhai chu zâna sihalhai ang an nih; a zînga chen dingin iengkhawm an hla naw a nih.
4,"Her prophets are light and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.","A zâwlneihai khawm chu mi ngaisam le mi khawhlo an na, a thiempuhai hlak chun hmun inthieng chu an sukpawrche tah a, dâna chun inpâwngnêkna chu an hmang ta a nih."
5,"Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.","Ama sûnga chun LALPA chu mi indik a na; rîtlona chu thaw naw ni; zîng tinin a rorêlna chu varah a hung lâk suok a, a thlâwn ngai hrim hrim nawh a; amiruokchu, mi fel naw chun inzakna a hriet naw a nih."
6,"I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.","Hnamhai chu ka sât thlâk a, an in insânghai chen khawm chu râu- sanin a um tah a; an kawtthlêrhai chu ka suksiet vawng a, tukhawma an hraw ta nawh a; an khawpuihai chu suksietin a um a, chuongchun, mi an um ta nawh a, a hluotu khawm an um ta nawh."
7,"I said, Only fear thou me; receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.","Ama chungthua ka lo ruot ta ang po poin, a chêngna chu sât thlâk a ni nawna dingin. “Matheiloin kei mi ṭîng i ta, sukdikna chu hmu bawk i tih,” ka ta; nisienlakhawm, zîngkâr an tho a, an thilthawhai po poa chun an sukdik nawh a."
8,"Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.","LALPA chun, “Chuleichun, kei mi nghâk unla, sase se dinga ka tho ni hmakhat chun, ka thiltum chu, ka lunginsenna ṭium tak le ka lungin- thak nasatak chu bun khum dinga ramhai ka kei khâwm theina dingin hnamhai kei khâwm chu a ni sih a; leihnuoi hluo po po chu ka îtthîkna mei chun a kâng hmang ding a ni sih a."
9,"For then will I turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun hmûr inthieng put chihai kuoma chun kîr nâwk ka ta, lungril hmun- khata a rawng bâwl dinga LALPA hming chu an rênga an lam theina dingin."
10,"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.","Ethiopia vadunghai khêla in- thawk chun ka riminhnik rawtuhai, ka hnawtdarhai naunuhmeihai ngei chun, ka thil inhlânhai chu hung chawi an ta."
11,"In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.","Chu nia chun i thil thawhai po po, ka chunga i bawsietnahai lei chun inzak ta naw ti nih a; nanga sûnga inthawkin nasataka nang chapopui- tuhai che chu ka lâk suok ding a ni ta sih a; chuongchun, ka tlâng inthienga chun chapo ta ngai hrim hrim naw ti nih."
12,"But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, i sûnga chun mi pasiehai le mî sukrimsika umhai chu mâksan ka ta, LALPA hming chu ring tâng an tih."
13,"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.","Israel mi hlabîkhai chun rîtlona thaw ta naw ni hai a, khêl khawm hril ta ngai naw nihai; an bauhaia chun lei mi hlêm hmangna hrim hrim khawm hmu ni ngai ta naw nih; khawp dingin fâng an ta, zâl an tih, tukhawma an sukṭi ta naw ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
14,"Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.","Aw Zion naunuhai, hla sak ro; aw Israel, khêk suok rawh; Aw Jerusalem naunu, lungril po poin hlimin lâwm rawh."
15,"Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more.","LALPA chun i chungthu rêlna chu a lâk hmang tah a, I hmêlma khawm chu a hnawt dawk tah a nih; Israel Lal, Lalpa ngei chu nangmaa chun a um a, Thil ṭha naw hril ṭi ta dêr naw ti nih."
16,"In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.","Chu ni chun Jerusalem kuoma chun, “Ṭi ta naw rawh: Aw Zion, i kut chu inzawitir naw rawh."
17,"Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.","LALPA i Pathien thilthawthei- tak, sandamtu ding chu i sûnga chun a um a; Nang chu hlimnain lâwm a ti che a, a hmangainaa chun châwl a ta, Hla sakin nangmaa chun hlim a tih."
18,"I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee; to whom the burden upon her was a reproach.","Nangma ta, sie hmanga um tahai, hrilsietna riktaka phurtuhai chu inkhâwmna ursûntaka dingin kei khâwm ka tih."
19,"Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.","Ngai ta, chu pha chun nangma sukrimsituhai che chu keiin sawisâng ka ta: A ngîr chu sandam ka ta, hnawt hmanga um chu kei khâwm ka tih; Hnuoi chung po poa an hmaimâwkna lo um ta chu, Hming le inpâkna siempêk ka tih."
20,"At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.","Chu pha chun hung la lût kati cheh a, chu pha chun la khâwm ka ti cheu; In mithmu ngeia in sal intângna ka hung lâk kîr pha chun, Leihnuoia hnam po polaia chun, inpâkna le hming ka siempêk ding cheu a ni sih a,” LALPA chun a tih."
