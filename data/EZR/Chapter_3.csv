1,"And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.","Chun, thla sarina a hung tlung a, Israel thlahai chu khuohaia an um phing chun, mipuihai chu in- thuruoltak elin Jerusalema chun an inkhâwm tah a."
2,"Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.","Chun, Jozadak naupa Jesua le a unau thiempuhai, Sealtiel naupa Zerubbabel le a unauhai le chun an tho a, Pathien mi Mosie dâna ziek angin, chutaka chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânna dingin Israel Pathien mâichâm chu an siem tah a."
3,"And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.","Chuongchun, mâichâm chu ân ṭhutnaa chun an inṭhut tah a; chuong rama mihai lei chun an chunga chun ṭitna chu a um sih a; chuongchun, pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu chutaka chun LALPA kuomah, pum- rawhmang thilinhlânhai ngei chu zîng le zânin an inhlân zie tah a."
4,"And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;","Chun, bâwkte ruoiṭhe khawm chu an nei a, zieka a um angin, thu- pêk ang peiin, ni tina thaw ding ṭul ang pei chun, ni tinin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu an inhlân tah a;"
5,"and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and the offerings of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto Jehovah.","chu hnunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân châmchi le, thla thara suk- thieng ta po pohai le, mi tinin LALPA kuoma mâni nuomthua inhâwktaka thilinhlânna dâm an nei tah a."
6,From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah: but the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid.,"thla sarina ni khat nia chun LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilin- hlânhai chu an inhlân ṭan a; ami- ruokchu, LALPA biekin lungphûm chu phûm a la ni hri nawh a."
7,"They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.","Lung sut mihai le themthiemhai kuoma chun sum an pêk a; chun, Persia lal Kuraa inthawka phalna an nei ang peiin, Lebanona inthawka tuisuorieta Joppa chena Sidar thing- hai an hung lâkna dingin, Zidon mihai le Tura mihai kuoma chun bu le dâwn ding le hriek dâm an pêk bawk a."
8,"Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of Jehovah.","Chun, Jerusalema Pathien ina an hung chin a kum hninaa, thla hninaa chun, Sealtiel naupa Zerub- babel le, Jozadak naupa Jesua le an unau dang thiempuhai le, Levi mihai le, sala intâng suoka Jerusalema hung po pohai chun an ṭan a; Levi mihai chu kum sâwmhnia upa le a chung tieng pohai chu LALPA ina sinthawna chu enkawl dingin an ruot tah a."
9,"Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.","Chun, Jesua le a naupasalhai le a unauhai le, Kadmiel le a naupasal- hai, Juda naupasalhai chu Pathien ina sinthaw mihai enkawl ding chun an tho tah a. Henadad naupasalhai le an naupahai le an unauhai Levi mihai le chun an tho ve tah a."
10,"And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel.","Chun, in bâwltuhai chun LAL- PA biekin lungphûm chu an phûm lai chun thiempuhai chu tawtawrâwt chawiin an thuoma inthuomin an ngîr a, chun, Israel lal David thupêk angin LALPA chu inpâk dingin Asaph naupasal Levi mihai chu dâr- benthekhai leh an ngîr bawk a."
11,"And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto Jehovah, saying, For he is good, for his lovingkindness endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.","LALPA kuoma lâwmthu hrilin le inpâkin insawntuoin hla an sak a, “Ama chu a ṭha sih a, Israelhai chunga a zângaina chu kumkhuoin a um zing sih a,” tiin. Chun, LALPA in lungphûm chu phûm a ni ta leiin, LALPA an inpâk lei chun mipui chu khêkri nasatakin an khêk a."
12,"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ houses, the old men that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:","Amiruokchu, thiempuhai, Levi mihai an pahnamhai laia mi tamtak, mi upahai chu in hmasa lo hmutuhai chu, an mithmu ngeia chu in lung- phûm chu phûm a lo ni chun rawl inringtak elin an ṭap tah a, mi danghai ruok chu lâwmin an khêk a;"
13,"so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.","chuongchun, mipuihai chun lâwma khêkri le mipuihai ṭap ri chu an ṭhehran thei naw hiel a; mipuihai chu ri nasatakin an khêk tâwl a, ram hlataka inthawk khawma ân hriet hiel el sih a."
