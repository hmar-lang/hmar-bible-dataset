1,"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto Jehovah, the God of Israel;","Juda le Benjamin hai hmêlmahai chun sal intâng suokhai chun Israel Pathien, LALPA ta dingin biekin an bâwl ti an lo hriet tah a;"
2,"then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ houses, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.","Zerubbabel le pahnama upahai kuoma chun anni chu an hung a, an kuomah, “Nangni hi bâwlpui vêng kan ti cheu, in thaw ang bawkin in Pathien hi a ni sia kan zawng chu; chuongchun, Assuria lal Esar-had- don, hitienga keini mi hung ṭhuoitu huna inthawk ta kha ama kuoma chun kan inthâwi hlak tah a nih,” an tih a."
3,"But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ houses of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.","Nisienlakhawm, Zerubbabel le Jesua le Israel pahnam upa danghai chun an kuomah, “Kan Pathien ta dinga in bâwl dingin keini le hin iengkhawm thaw ding in nei nawh; Persia lal Kurain keini thu a mi pêk angin, Israelhai Pathien, LALPA ta dinga in chu keini khât ngeiin bâwl lem kan tih,” an tih a."
4,"Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,","Chuongchun, chu rama mihai chun Juda mihai kut chu an sukhrât- naw tah a, in bâwl thua chun an sukbuoi a,"
5,"and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.","an thiltum chu khap dingin an chunga rorêltuhai, Persia lal Kura dam sûng le, Persia lal Daria rorêl chen khan an ruoi tah a."
6,"And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, Ahasuera rorêl lai, a rorêl ṭan hlimin Jerusalem le Juda rama umhai chunga hêkna an ziek tah a."
7,"And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian character, and set forth in the Syrian tongue.","Chun, Artazerzia hun laiin, Bislam hai, Mithredath hai, Tabeel hai le a ruol danghaiin Persia lal Artazerzia kuoma chun lekha an ziek a, chu lekha chu Suria lekhaa ziek, Suria ṭawnga ziek a na."
8,Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:,Rorêltu Rehum le lekhaziektu Simsai chun Jerusalem chungthuah hieng ang hin lal Artazerzia kuoma chun an ziek a;
9,"then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,","chuongchun, rorêltu Rehum le lekhaziektu Simsai le an ruol dang- hai rorêltuhai, ram awptuhai, ram hotuhai, Persia mihai, Erek mihai, Babulon mihai, Elam mi Susana umhai le,"
10,"and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth.","hnam dang danghai, milien le ropui Osnapparin a hnawt dawk a, Samari ram khawpuihaia ân umtir- hai le vadung râltienga an umtirhai le chun chu lekha chu an ziek a na."
11,"This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.","Hieng hi an lekha ziek dân chu a nih; Laltak Artazerzia kuomah: “Va- dungpui râla i siehlawhai leh, chuong ang peiin,"
12,"Be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.","i kuoma inthawka Juda hung- hai kha Jerusalemah kan kuomah an hung a nih ti hi lal chun lo hre raw se; khawpui sie le hel chu an bâwl a, a kulhai chu an zo tah a, a lungphûm- hai chu an siem ṭha mêk a nih."
13,"Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings.","Hi khuo hi hienga an bâwl a, a kulhai an zo chun, leiman dâm, sie amanih, ram man amanih pe naw ni hai a, a tâwpa chun lalhai chu sukse ngei an tih ti hi lal chun lo hre bawk raw se."
14,"Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;","Tuhin lal in ropui chi chu liek kan na, lal hang sukmuolpho chu kan ta dingin a âwm naw a nih, chuleiin, kan hung thawnin lal chu kan hrilfie a nih;"
15,"that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.","i pi le puhai thu ziekna lekha- bua chun zawng ni sien la, chuong- chun, chu thu ziekna lekhabua chun hmûng i ta, hi khuo hi khaw hel a na, ram le lalhai ta ding khawma pawitâwk a na, inhma khawma buoina an lo siem tah a; chuong lei chun hi khuo hi suksiet a nih ti hrieng i tih."
16,"We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.","Hi khuo hi bâwl a hung na, a kulhai chu zo a hung ni ngei ngei chun vadung râla hin chu hieng ang hin chan hrim nei naw ti nih ti lal chu kan hung hrilfie a nih,” tiin."
17,"Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.","Chuongchun, lal chun rorêltu Rehum le, lekhaziektu Simsai le Samaria um an ruol danghai kuoma le, vadung râla khawsa hlakhai kuoma chun dawnna chu ân phur tah a, “In- remna um raw se, chuong ang peiin."
18,The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.,Kan kuoma lekhathawn in hung inphur kha ka hma ngeiah chiengtaka tiem a ni tah a.
19,"And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.","Chun, thu ka pêk a, zawngna chu siem a ni ta bawk a, chuongchun, inhmain hi khuo hin lalhai chungah helna lo siem tain, buoina le helna chu chutaka chun a lo um ta a nih ti hmu suok a ni tah a."
20,"There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid unto them.","Vadung râl ram po po chunga rorêltu, Jerusalem vêla khan lal thilthawtheitak takhai an um a; an kuoma chun leiman dâm, ram man dâm, sie dâm pêk a ni hlak a."
21,"Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me.","Tuhin, hieng mihai hi suktâwp dingin thupêk siem unla, hi khuo hi bâwl pei ni ta naw raw se; keima ngeiin thupêk ka siem hmakhat chun."
22,And take heed that ye be not slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?,"Chun, hi thua hin vuoicha lo dingin fîmkhur rawh; lalhai sukpawi ding elin iengdingin am sietna chu a hung suok ding a na?” tiin."
23,"Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.","Chun, lal Artazerzia lekha chu Rehum le, lekhaziektu Simsai le, an ruolhai hmaa tiem a ni phing chun, inhmâwtakin Judahai kuomah Jeru- salema chun an feh a, thilthawtheina le thawluinain anni chu an suktâwp tah a."
24,Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.,"Chuongchun, Jerusalema um, Pathien in sinthaw chu a lo tâwp tah a; Persia lal Daria rorêl kum hnina chen chun châwlsan a ni tah a."
