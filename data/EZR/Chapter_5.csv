1,"Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel prophesied they unto them.","Chun, zâwlneihai, Haggai le Iddo naupa Zekaria chun Juda ram le Jerusalema Juda umhai kuoma chun thu an hrillâwk a; Israel Pathien hmingin a nih anni chun thu an hrillâwk chu."
2,"Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.","Chun, Sealtiel naupa Zerubbabel le Jozadak naupa Jesua chu an tho a, Jerusalema um, Pathien in chu an bâwl ṭan tah a; chun, an kuoma chun Pathien zâwlneihai chu anni ṭhang- puiin an um bawk a."
3,"At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?","Chu hun lai chun vadung râl tieng rorêltu Tattenai le Sethar- bozenai le an ruolhai chu an kuomah an hung a, an kuomah, “Hi in bâwl ding le, kul hi siemzo dingin tuin am thu a pêk cheu a?” an ta."
4,"Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the men were that were making this building.","Chun, an kuoma chun hieng ang hin thu kan hril a, “Hi in bâwltuhai hi an hming ieng am a na?” tiin."
5,"But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.","Nisienlakhawm, an Pathien mit chu Juda upahai chunga chun a fuh a, chu thu chu Daria kuom a tlung a, a chungthua dawnna lekha chu a hung tlung hmakhat chun anni chu an suktâwp ta nawh a."
6,"The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king;","Vadung râltieng rorêltu Tattenai le Sethar-bozenai le a ruolhai Aphar- sak mihai, vadung râltienga umhai- in lal Daria lekhathawn an inphur chu:"
7,"they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: Unto Darius the king, all peace.","a kuoma chun lekhathawn an inphur a, chutaka chun hieng anga ziek hi a nih: “Lal Daria kuomah, inremna po po um raw se."
8,"Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands.","Juda ram bielah, Pathien in ropuitaka chun kan feh a, chu chu lung ropuitakhaia bâwl a na, a banghai chu thinga siem a na; chun, sin chu taimataka thaw pei a na, an kuta chun a hung hlawtling hle el a nih ti hi lal chun lo hre raw se."
9,"Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?","Chun, chuong upahai chu, ‘Hi in bâwl ding le kul hi siemzo dingin tuin am thu a pêk cheu a?’ tiin kan in- dawn a."
10,"We asked them their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.","Hung hrilfie ding chein, anni laia lua um mihai hminghai chu kan hung ziek theina dingin, an hminghai khawm kan indawn bawk a."
11,"And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished.","Chun, anni chun hieng ang hin an mi dawn a, ‘Hnuoi le vân Pathien siehlawhai kan na, Israel lal ropui- takin a lo bâwl zo tah, hi kum tam- taka lo bâwl tah in hi kan bâwl a nih."
12,"But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.","Nisienlakhawm, chu hnunga chun kan thlatuhai chun vân Pathien chu an lo suklungsen a, ama chun Kaldai mi, Babulon lal, Nebukadnez- zar, hi in hi suksea, mihai chu Babulon tienga ṭhuoi sâwngtu kuta chun a pêk tah a."
13,"But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.","Nisienlakhawm, Babulon lal Kura inlal kum khatnaa chun, lal Kura chun hi Pathien in hi bâwlna dingin thupêk chu a siem ta a nih."
14,"And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;","Chun, rângkachak le tangka- raw bûr le bêlhai Nebukadnezzarin Jerusalem biekina inthawka a lâk a, Babulon biekina a hung lâkhai chu, chuonghai ngei chu lal Kura chun Babulon biekina inthawk chun a lâk suok a, mi pakhat a hming Sesbazzar, amain rorêltua a siem ngei kuoma chun chuong chu a pêk a nih;"
15,"and he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place.","ama kuoma chun, Hieng bûr le bêlhai hi la la, fe la, Jerusalema um biekina chun sie rawh; chun, Pathien in chu a hmun ngaia ngei bâwl ni raw se, a tih a."
16,"Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed.","Chun, chu Sesbazzar bawk chu a hung a, Jerusalema um Pathien in lungphûm a phûm tah a; chutaka inthawk tah tu chen hin bâwl a ni ta zing a, zo fel lo a la ni zing a nih,’ tiin."
17,"Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.","Chuleiin, tuhin lalin ṭha a ti zâwng a ni chun chu Babulona lal sum inah zawng ni sienla, Jerusa- lema Pathien in hi bâwlna dingin lal Kura chun thupêk a lo siem ta chun chutaka chun a um âwm sih a; chun, lal chun hi thu chungchânga hin ṭha a ti zâwng chu mi hung hril bawk raw se,” tiin."
