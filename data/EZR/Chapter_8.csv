15,"And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.","Anni chu Ahavaa luong lût vadunga chun ka kei khâwm tâwl a; chutaka chun ni thum lai chu kan riek a; chun, thiempuhai le mipuihai chu ka thlîr vêl chun Levi thlahai hrim ka hmu ta nawh a."
16,"Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.","Chuongchun, Eliezer, Ariel, Semaia, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zekaria, Mesullam hai mi lutakhai chu kân chah a, Joiarib le Elnathan inchûktirtuhai chu kân cha sa bawk a."
17,"And I sent them forth unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.","Anni chu Kasiphia hmuna lal Iddo kuoma chun ka tir tah a; Pathien ina rawngbâwltu dinghai an mi hung ṭhuoipêk theina dingin, Kasiphia hmuna, Iddo le a unau Nethinim mihai kuoma an thuhril ding chu ka hril a."
18,"And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;","Chun, ka chunga kan Pathien kut ṭhatzie ang peiin anni chun mi lungril indiktak Israel naupa Levi naupa Mahli naupahai laia mi, Serebia, a unauhai le a naupasalhai leh sâwmpariet an mi hung ṭhuoi- pêk a;"
19,"and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;","chun, Hasabia le Merari nau- pahai Jesaia, a unauhai le an nau- pasalhai leh sâwmhni;"
20,"and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name.","chun, Nethinim mi, David le lalhaiin Levi mihai rawng bâwl dinga an pêkhai Nethinim mihai za hni le sâwmhni leh; an rêng chun hminga ko seng an nih."
21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.","Chun, kan thuomhnawhai po po le kan nau-le-têhai le keini ta dinga lampui tluong mi zawngpêk dinga, kan Pathien hmaa chun kan insuk- hnuoi theina dingin, Ahava vadunga chun bunghei ka rawt tah a."
22,"For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.","Lal kuoma chun, “Ama zawng- tuhai chunga chun Pathien kut chu ṭhatna dingin a um a, ama nghat- santuhai po po chunga ruok chun, thilthawtheina le lunginsenna a um a nih,” kan lo ti ta si leiin, lampuia hmêlmahaia inthawka mi ṭhangpui dinga sakawr chung chuong mi le sipai pâwl lal kuoma hni kân zak sih a."
23,So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.,"Chuongchun, bu chu kan nghei a, hi hi ding hin kan Pathien chu kan ngên a: chuongchun, keini ngên- thlûkin ama chu a um tah a."
24,"Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,","Chun, thiempuhai laia a bîk deuhai sâwmpahni, Serebia, Hasabia le an unauhai sâwm ka sie hran a;"
25,"and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:","chuongchun, tangka le râng- kachak le bûr le bêlhai, kan Pathien in ta dinga thilpêk, lal le a rorêltuhai le, a mi ṭhahai le chutaka Israel umhai po poin an pêkhai chu anni chu ka bûkpêk tah a."
26,"I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents;","Kei ngei khawma an kuta chun tangkaruo talent za ruk sâwmnga le, bûr le bêlhai talent za khat ka bûkpêk a; rângkachak talent za leh;"
27,"and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.","rângkachak maihûn sâwmhni, darik sâng khat bûk seng, chun, râng- kachak anga hlu ve bawk, dâr tle mi bêl pahni leh."
28,"And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers.","Chun, an kuomah ka hril a, “Nangni hi LALPA kuoma inthieng in na, a bûr le bêlhai khawm inthieng an nih; chun, hieng tangka le rângka- chakhai hi in thlatuhai Pathien LALPA kuoma inhâwktaka pêk an ni vawng a nih."
29,"Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ houses of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.","Jerusalemah, LALPA in pin- danhaia, Israel pahnam mi ṭhahai le, Levi mihai le thiempu laltakhai hmaa in bûkpêk hmakhat chun, fîmkhur unla, kawl tlat ro,” tiin."
30,"So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.","Chuongchun, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chun kan Pathien ina Jerusalema hung lâk dingin rângka- chak le tangkaruo chuong ang bûk chu an lâk tah a."
31,"Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the lier-in-wait by the way.","Chun, Jerusalema fe ding chun Ahava vadunga inthawkin thla khat- naa ni sâwmpahni ni chun kan suok tah a; chuongchun, kan Pathien kut chu kan chunga chun a um a, ama chun hmêlmahai le lampuia mîn chântu kuta inthawk chun a mi sansuok a."
32,"And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.","Jerusalem chu kan hung tlung a, chutaka chun ni thum lai chu kan hang um phawt a."
33,"And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest (and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levites)—","A ni li ni chun a nih, chuong rângkachak le tangkaruo le bûr le bêlhai chu kan Pathien ina chun thiempu Uria naupa Meremoth kuta bûkin kan inhlân chu; ama le chun Phinehas naupa Eleazar chu a um nghe nghe a; chun, anni le chun, Levi mihai, Binnui naupa Noadia le Jesua naupa Jozabad chu an um bawk a;"
34,the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time.,"a rêngin a zât le a bûkin; a bûk zât chu, chu huna chun ziek a ni nghe nghe bawk a."
35,"The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.","Chun, sal intâng mihai intâng- naa inthawka hung suokhai chun Israel Pathien kuoma chun Israelhai po po puolah; bâwngchal sâwmpahni le, berâmchal sâwmkuo paruk, berâmte sâwmsari pasari le; kêlchal sâwmpahni suol thilinhlâna dingin; pumrawhmang thilinhlânah an in- hlân tah a; hieng po po hi LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilinhlân a nih."
36,"And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God.","Chun, lal thupêkhai chu vadung râla lal ram awptuhai le rorêltuhai kuoma chun an pêk suok tah a; chun, Pathien in le mipuihai chu ṭhangpuina an pêk tah a."
