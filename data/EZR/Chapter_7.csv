6,"this Ezra went up from Babylon. And he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him.","hi Ezra hi Babulona inthawk chun a hang feh a: Israel Pathien LALPAIN a pêk Mosie dân ziek thiem mi a na; chun, lal khawm chun a Pathien LALPA kut a chunga a um ang pei chun a hni taphawt chu a phalpêk a."
7,"And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.","Chuongchun, lal Artazerzia inlal kum sarinaa chun Israel thlahai ṭhenkhat le thiempuhai le Levi mihai le hlasaktuhai le, kawtkhâr vêngtu- hai le, Nethinim mihai chu Jerusa- lema chun an hang feh a."
8,"And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.","Ama chu lal inlal a kum sarinaa, a thla nganaa chun a nih Jerusalema a hung chu."
9,"For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.","Thla khatna, ni khat nia chun Babulona inthawk chun a fe suok ṭan a, a chunga Pathien kut ṭha innghat ang peiin thla ngana, ni khat ni chun Jerusalem chu a tlung tah a."
10,"For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.","Ezra chun LALPA dân chu zawng a, thawh a, rorêlnahai le thu- ruothai chun Israel rama chun inchûktir a lungrilin a tum tlat a."
11,"Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:","Hi hi LALPA thupêk le Israelhai kuoma a thuruot thuhai ziektu, thiempu le lekhaziektu Ezra kuoma lal Artazerziain lekha a pêk ziek- sâwng chu a nih,"
12,"Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth.","“Lalhai lal, Artazerzia chun, thiempu Ezra, vâna Pathien dân ziektu Ezra kuomah muongna kim um raw se."
13,"I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.","Ka ram sûnga Israel mihai po po, an thiempuhai le Levi mihai leh, mânia Jerusalema fe inhâwkna neituhai chu nanga ruola fe dingin thupêk ka siem a nih."
14,"Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,",I kuta um i Pathien dân ang peia Jerusalem le Juda ram chungthu chu dâwpsuok dinga lal le a rorêltu pasarihai itir i ni leiin le;
15,"and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,","Jerusalema um Israel Pathien kuoma phaltaka lal le a rorêltuhaiin an pêk rângkachak le tangkaruohai phur dingin le,"
16,"and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;","Babulon biel po poa mipuihai le thiempuhaiin Jerusalema an Pathien in ta dinga phaltaka an pêk, râng- kachak le tangkaruo i hmu thei zât zât chu chawi dinga tir i nih:"
17,"therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.","chuleichun, hi sum hi fîmkhur- takin bâwngchalhai, berâmchalhai, berâmtehai, an bu thilinhlân le dâwn mi thilinhlânhai leh inchâwng i ta, Jerusalema um i Pathien ina mâi- châma chun inhlân i tih."
18,"And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God.","Chun, rângkachak le tangka la chuong chu i unauhai le nanga ngaia ṭha ang angin, in Pathien dit zâwngin hmang in tih."
19,"And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.",I Pathien in rawngbâwlna dinga bûr le bêl an pêkhai che chu Jerusa- lema Pathien hmaa chun pe suok rawh.
20,"And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king’s treasure-house.","Chun, pêkna hun i nei phaa i Pathien in ta dinga thil mamaw taphawt chu lal sum ina inthawkin pe suok el rawh."
21,"And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,","Keima, kei Artazerzia ngei hin thupêk ka siem a, vadung râltienga sum enkawltuhai po po kuoma chun, ‘Thiempu Ezra, vân Pathien dân ziektu hin thil a hni taphawt cheu chu fîmkhurtaka thaw dingin thu ka pêk cheu:"
22,"unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.","tangkaruo talent za khat chen khawm, bu bûk za khat chen khawm, uoin bath za khat chen khawm, hriek bath za khat chen khawm, chi khawm ieng zât am ti um lo dingin."
23,"Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?","Vân Pathienin a iphût ang taphawt el chu, vân Pathien in ta ding chun thaw tei ni raw se; ieng- dingin am lal le a naupahai ram chunga hin a lunginsenna chu um a ta?"
24,"Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them.","Chun, thiempuhai, Levi mihai, hlasaktuhai, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai, Nethinim mihai amanih, Pathien in rawngbâwltuhai hrim hrim chung- thua chun, anni chu leiman amanih, ram man amanih, sie amani khawm inchawitir chu dân ni naw nih tiin thu kan pêk bawk che a nih,’"
25,"And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not.","Chun, nang Ezra hin, i kawl Pathienin varna a pêk che ang peiin vadung râltienga mihai chunga rorêl dingin i Pathien dânhai hre mihai ang chu ram awptu le rorêltuhai dingin thlang i tih, a la hre nawhai chu inchuktir unla."
26,"And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.","Mi tukhawm i Pathien dân anga thaw lo le lal dân anga thaw lo chu a chungah inrangtaka rorêlthlûk ni sienla, thi dingin amanih, hnawtsuok dingin amanih, thuomhnawhai chân ding amanih, lungina khum ding amanih ni dingin,” tiin."
27,"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem;",Jerusalema LALPA in cheimawi dinga lal lungrila thil hienga sietu ei thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu inpâk- in um raw se;
28,"and hath extended lovingkindness unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of Jehovah my God upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.","Ama chun lal hmaa le a rorêltuhai hmaa le lal mi ṭhahai po po hmaa chun ka chungah zângaina a hung suklien tah a. Chuongchun, ka chunga ka Pathien LALPA kut ang peiin sukhrâtin ka um tah a, Israel- hai laia inthawk chun ka ruola hang fe ve dingin, mi lusa deuhai chu ka kei khâwm tah a."
