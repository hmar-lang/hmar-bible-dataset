1,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,","Persia lal Kura inlal kum khatna chun, Jeremia baua LALPA thu- hril chu a hung tlung theina dingin LALPA chun Persia lal Kura lungril chu a chawktho tah a, chuongchun, a ram po poa chun thu inhriettirna a siem a, a zieka ziek khawmin a sie bawk a,"
2,"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.","“Persia lal Kura chun hieng ang hin a hril, ‘Leihnuoia ram po pohai chu LALPA vâna Pathien chun a mi pêk a; Juda rama Jerusalema chun a ta dinga in bâwl dingin a mi phût bawk a nih."
3,"Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.","A mi po pohai, nangni laia mi tukhawm kuomah a Pathien chu um raw se! Juda rama Jerusalema chun hang fe sienla, LALPA Israelhai Pathien (ama chu Jerusalema um Pathien chu a nih) in chu hang bâwl raw se."
4,"And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.","Chun, mi tukhawm ân pêmna hmun khâwlaia khawm mâksan a um chun, ama hmuna mihai chu tangkaruo le, rângkachak le, thuom- hnawhai le, ranhaiin nuomthua pêk bâkah ṭhangpui raw se,’” tiin."
5,"Then rose up the heads of fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.","Chun, Juda le Benjamin pahnam luhai le thiempuhai le, Levi mihai, Jerusalema um LALPA in bâwl dinga hang fe dinga Pathienin an lungril a chawkthohai taphawt chu an tho tah a."
6,"And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.","Chun, an vêla mi po pohai chun, inhâwktaka an inhlân po po bâka chun, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, thuomhnawhai dâm, ranhai dâm le thil hlutakhaiin an kuthai chu an sukhrât a."
7,"Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;","Lal Kura khawm chun LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai, Nebukadnezzarin Jerusalema inthawka a hung lâk a, a pathien ina a siehai chu a hung lâk suok a."
8,"even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.","Persia lal Kura chun, chuonghai ngei chu sum enkawltu Mithredath kutin a hung lâk suok a, Juda ram lal Sesbazzar kuoma chun a tiempêk tah a."
9,"And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,","Chun, hi hi chuonghai nizât chu a nih; rângkachak thlêng lien sâwm- thum, tangkaraw thlêng lien sâng khat, chemtê sâwmhni pakuo;"
10,"thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.","rângkachak no sâwmthum, tangkaraw no a chi dang za li le sâwm khat le bûr le bêl dang hrim hrim sâng khat leh."
11,"All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.","Rângkachak le tangkaraw bûr le bêl po pohai chu sâng nga le za li an nih. Hienghai po po hi Sesbazzar chun, sal intânghai Babulona in- thawka Jerusalema an hung ṭhuoi ruol chun a hung lâk ve a nih."
