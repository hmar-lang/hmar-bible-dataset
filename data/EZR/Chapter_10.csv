1,"Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.","Ezra chu a ṭawngṭai a, thupha a chawi a, Pathien in tuola bawkkhupa a ṭap a ṭap sûng chun, pasal le nuhmei le naupang mipui nasatak el Israel mihai laia mi chu an hung inkhâwm ta ṭeu el a; mipuihai chu nasatakin an ṭap an ṭap el sih a."
2,"And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.","Elam naupasalhai laia pakhat, Jehiel naupa Sekania chun Ezra chu a dawn a, a kuomah, “Ei Pathien chunga chun ei bawsiet ta chu a na, hi rama mihai hmêlmak nuhmeihai chu nuhmeia dâm ei nei tah a, ami- ruokchu, hi chungthua hin Israel mi ta ding hin beisei um a la um a nih."
3,"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.","Chuleiin, tuhin, chuong nuhmei- hai po po chu ma ding le, annia inthawka pieng taphawt chu sie hmang dingin, Lalpa le ei Pathien thupêka inthintuhai rorêl ang peiin, ei Pathien leh thuthlung siem ei tiu; chuongchun, dân ang taka thaw ni raw se."
4,"Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it.","Tho rawh, hi thu hi nanga chungah ân nghat a nih; chun, hi keini khawm nanga kuomah kan ṭhang ve bawk a, insukhuoi la, thaw el rawh,” tiin."
5,"Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they sware.","Chun, Ezra chu a tho a, thiempu laltakhai, Levi mihai, Israel mi po pohai le chun hi thu ang tak hin inkhâm dingin a tir tah a. Chuong- chun, an inkhâm tah a."
6,"Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.","Chun, Ezra chu Pathien in tuola chu a tho a, Eliasib naupa Jehohanan pindana chun a va fe tah a; chun, chutaka a va fe khawm chun, bei a fâk nawh a, tui khawm a dâwn bawk nawh a; sal intâng suokhai bawsiet- na lei chun nasatakin a lungngai sih a."
7,"And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;","Chun, Juda ram le Jerusalem vêl po poa chun sal intâng suokhai po po kuomah, Jerusalemah an hung khâwm vawng ding a na;"
8,"and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.","tukhawm ni thum sûnga hung naw chu mi ṭhahai le upahai rorêl dân angin a thuomhnaw po po chu chân a ta, ama ngei khawm chu sal intâng suokhai laia inthawk pâwlser nîng a tih, tiin thuphuong an siem tah a."
9,"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days (it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month); and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.","Chuongchun, Juda le Benjamin rama mi po pohai chu ni thum sûngin Jerusalema chun an hung inkhâwm ṭeu el tah a; chu chu thla kuona, ni sâwmhni ni tak a nih: chuongchun, mipuihai chu ruopui nasatak lei le, hi thu lei hin inthin pumin Pathien in tuol hmun âwla chun an ṭhung tâwl tah a."
10,"And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.","Chun, thiempu Ezra chu a ngîr suok a, an kuomah, “In bawsiet tah a, Israel ram khawhlona chu belsa ding- in hmêlmak nuhmei in nei nâwk nghâl a."
11,"Now therefore make confession unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.","Chuleiin, tuhin, in thlatuhai Pathien LALPA kuoma chun thupha- chawina siem unla, a dit zâwng chu thaw ro: chuongchun, hmêlmak nu- hmeihaia inthawk le hi ram mihaia inthawkin nangni chu insiehre ro,” a ta."
12,"Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.","Chun, mipui pungkhâwm po pohai chun an dawn a, râwl inring- takin, “Kan chungthu i hril ang tak chun, chuong ang ngei chun kan thaw ding a nih."
13,"But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.","Amiruokchu, mipui hi tamtak an na, ruo nasatak sûr lai a ni bawk a, tuola hin kan um zing thei nawh a, ni khat ni hni sin el khawm a ni bawk nawh a, hi thil chunga hin nasatakin kan lo bawsiet ta sih a."
14,"Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.","Kan mi ṭhahai hi mipui aiaw dingin thlang ni hai sienla, hi thil hi sukfel a ni hmakhat, kan chunga Pathien lunginsenna ṭiumtak chu hlîpthlâk a ni hmakhat chun, kan khuohaia hmêlmak nuhmei neituhai chu, khaw tina upahai le rorêltuhai leh hun ruotahai chun hung lem raw hai se,” an ta."
15,Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.,"Asahel naupa Jonathan le Tikva naupa Jahzeia chau chun hi thu hi an kal a, Mesullam le Sabbe- thai Levi mihai chun anni chu an thlawp thung a."
16,"And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers’ houses, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.","Chuongchun, sal intâng suok- hai chun chuong ang chun an thaw tah a. Chun, thiempu Ezra chu, an pahnam ang peiin, pahnam upa ṭhenkhathai leh, an rêngin an hming suot sengin an siehran tah a. Chuongchun, thla sâwmna, ni khat ni chun chu thil chu enfie dingin an ṭhung tah a."
17,And they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.,"Chun, thla khatna, ni khat ni chun hmêlmak nuhmei nei mihai po po chu an zo tah a."
18,"And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women: namely, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.","Chun, thiempuhai naupasalhai lai ngei khawm chun hmêlmak nuhmei lo neituhai chu hmusuok an hung ni tah a: hming lamin hieng, Jozadak naupa Jesua naupasalhai, an unauhai leh; Maaseia, Eliezer, Jarib le Gedalia hai hi."
19,"And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.","Anni chun an nuhmeihai chu ma dingin thu an tiem a; chuong- chun, khawhlo an lo ni ta lei chun, an suol ta dingin berâm ruol laia mi berâmchal pakhat an inhlân tah a."
