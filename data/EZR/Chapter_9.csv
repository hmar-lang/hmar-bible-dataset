1,"Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.","Hieng thilhai hi thaw a ni zo chun, mi ṭhahai chu ka kuomah an hung a, “Israel mipuihai le thiem- puhai le Levi mihai hi hieng a rama um Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Periz mihai, Jebus mihai, Ammon mihai, Moab mihai, Aigupta mihai le Amor mihaia inthawk hin insiekieng loin, an tirdakumnahai chu an thaw ve zing el a nih."
2,"For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.","An naupasalhai le annihai ta ding ngei khawma an naunuhmeihai an nei sih a; chuongchun, chi inthieng chu annia hin hieng rama mihai le hin ân chawkpawl tah a; anih, hi bawsietnaa hin mi ṭhahai le rorêltuhai hi a hmaṭhuoi an ni nghe nghe a nih,” an ta."
3,"And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.","Hieng thu hi ka hriet phing chun ka silfên le ka zakawfuol chu ka keithlêr a, ka lua ka sam chu ka phawi ṭil a, ka khâkhmul leh; mak- titakin ka ṭhung tah a."
4,"Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.","Chun, sal intâng suokhai an bawsietna leia Israel Pathien thua lo inthin hlakhai po kha ka kuoma chun an hung inkhâwm a; chun, kei chu zântieng thilinhlân hun chenin maktiin ka ṭhung ta zing a."
5,"And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God;","Chun, zântienga thilinhlân hun ding lai chun ka silfên le ka zakaw- fuol inek pum chun ka lungngainaa inthawk chun ka tho suok a; ka khûpin ka dingṭhaṭhuon a, LALPA ka Pathien kuom tieng chun ka bânhai ka phar a,"
6,"and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens.","“Aw ka Pathien, nanga tienga hung nghat khawm hi ka hmai a mâwkin kân zak a nih, ka Pathien, kan khawhlonahai chu kan lu chunga hin a hung pung deu deu a, kan suolhai chun vân a tawng ta a ni hi."
7,"Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.","Kan thlatuhai hun laia inthawk tah vawisûn ni chen hin suol namên loin kan suol ta a; kan khawhlonahai lei hin kan lalhai le kan thiempuhai chu hieng ram lalhai kuthaia hin pêk suokin an um tah a; vawisûn ni ang chen khawm hin hmêla ham- haina le, suksietnaa le sal intângnaa le kâwlhnâm kuoma pêkin an um hi."
8,"And now for a little moment grace hath been showed from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.","Tuhin mitkhapkâr tawitea ding- in kan Pathien LALPA zângaina chu hla bîkhai mi la mâksanpêk ding le, a hmun inthienga um zingna mi pe dingin kan Pathien chun kan mithai a hung sukvar a, kan sal intângnaa hin sukharna tlâwmte bêk a mi pêk theina dingin inlangtirin a um a."
9,"For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended lovingkindness unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.","Sal intâng kan na, amiruokchu, kan sal intângnaa khawm chun kan Pathien chun a mi nghatsan ngai nawh a, Jerusalem le Juda rama kul- hai mi pe ding le, chutaka in siehai chu siem ṭha ding le kan Pathien in chu tungding dinga thathona mi pe dingin, Persia lalhai mithmua chun kan chungah lunginsietna a hung sukpung ta lem a."
10,"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,","Chuongchun, tuhin, Aw kan Pathien, hi thua hin iengam hril tâng kan ta? I thupêkhai chu kan lo nghat- san ta sih a:"
11,"which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:","khâng i siehlaw zâwlneihai hmanga i lo pêk tah, ‘Chu ram hluo dinga in fena ding chu ram thieng- naw, a rama mihai inthieng nawna- haia sukthieng naw, an inthieng- nawna kil khata inthawka kil khing- tieng chena sip, chu an inthieng naw- naa inthieng naw chu a nih."
12,"now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.","Chuleiin, tuhin, in naupasalhai chu an naunuhmeihai inneitir naw unla, in naunuhmeihai chu an naupa- salhai khawm inneitir bawk naw ro; kumkhuoa dingin an hausakna amanih, anni le inremna amanih zawng bawk naw ro, chu ram thil ṭha chu in fâk a, in hung hrât a, kum- khuoa dinga in thlahai ta dinga rochan dinga in mâksanpêk theina dingin,’ ti kha."
13,"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant,","Chuong po po hnunga chun kan suol nasatak lei le, kan suksuolnahai leiin kan chungah a hung tlung a, nang kan Pathien hin kan khaw- hlonahaiin a phutâwk nêka nêp lemin i mi hrem a, a mahla khawm i mi la hlapêk a nih ti hmu zing si hin,"
14,"shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?","i thupêkhai chu kan bawsiet nâwkin, hieng pawrchenahai thawtu mipuihai le hin ṭhe ruolloin kan lân zawm zing ding am a nih? A suok ding um dêr loa, a mahla khawm hla dêr loa i mi kânghmang dêr hmakhat chun nang chu i lungdam ding am a nih?"
15,"O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before thee because of this.","Aw LALPA, Israel Pathien, nang chu în dik a, a suok a mahla chu i mi lo hlapêk ta sih a, vawisûn ni ang chen khawm hin: ngai ta, kan khaw- hlonahai leh i hmaa hin kan um a ni hi; hi hi lei hin tukhawm i hmaa chun an ngîr thei âwm si nawh a,” tiin."
