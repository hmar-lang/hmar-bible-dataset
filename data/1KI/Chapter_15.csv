2,Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.,"Jerusalem khuoah kum thum ân lal a, a nu hming chu Maaka, Abisa- lom naunu a nih."
3,"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.",A hmaa a pain thil suol a thawhai po po kha a thaw veh a; a pu David lungril angin a lungril chu LALPA a Pathien tienga chun a ṭha famkim ve nawh a.
4,"Nevertheless for David’s sake did Jehovah his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;","Nisienlakhawm, David leiin LALPA Pathien chun ama hnunga a naupa la tungdingna ding le Jerusalem khuo inngîr det dingin Jerusalem khuoa chun khâwnvar a pêk a."
5,"because David did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.",Hit mi Uria chungchâng ti nawa chun Davidin LALPA mithmua thil- ṭha a thaw hlak lei le a dam sûng poa thaw dinga thu a pêk taphawt chu a sêl ngai dêr naw leiin.
6,Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.,Rehoboam chu a dam sûng po chu Jeroboam leh an indo zing zing hlak a.
7,"And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.",Abijam chanchin le a thilthaw danghai po po chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?
8,And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.,"Abijam le Jeroboam chu an indo hlak a. Chun, Abijam chu a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, David khaw- puia chun an phûm tah a; ama aiawin a naupa Asa chu ân lal tah a."
9,And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.,Israel lal Jeroboam chu kum sâwmhni ân lal kum chun Asa chu Judahai chungah ân lal ṭan a.
10,And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.,"Chun, kum sâwmli le kum khat chu Jerusalemah ân lal a, a pi hming chu Maaka, Abisalom naunu a nih."
11,"And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as did David his father.",Asa chun a pu David ang bawkin LALPA mithmua thilṭha a thaw hlak a.
12,"And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.","Chun, pasal inzawrhai chu a rama inthawkin a hnawt suok a, a puhaiin milim an lo siemhai po po chu a sukbo vawng a."
13,"And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.","A pi Maaka khawm chu milim tirdakumtak Asera a siempêk leiin, a lalnu nina chu a bân a; chun, Asa chun a milim siem chu a sât thlûk a, Kidron vadungah a rawh a."
14,But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all his days.,"Bâwlhmunhai ruok chu a sukbo nawh a, nisienlakhawm, Asa lungril chu a dam sûng po chun LALPA tieng chun a ṭha famkim a nih."
15,"And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.","Chun, a pain thil a lo inhlân tasahai le ama ngeiin a lo inhlân tah, tangkaruohai, rângkachak dâm, bûr le bêlhai chu LALPA inah a lâk lût a."
16,And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.,"Chun, Asa le Israel lal Baasa chu an inlal sûng po chu an indo zing hlak a."
17,"And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.","Israel lal Baasa chun Judahai chu a hang thawh a, Juda lal Asa kuoma lût ding le suok ding dangna dingin Rama khuo a siem a."
18,"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,","Chuongchun, Asa chun LALPA ina le lal ina ro la um tangkaruo le rângkachak po po chu a lâk a, a siehlawhai a pêk a; chun, lal Asa chun Damaska khuoa um Suria lal Hezion nau Tabrimon naupa Ben- hadad kuoma chun,"
19,"There is a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.","“Nang le keia kâra le ka pa le i pa kârah thuthlung a um a, ngai ta, lâwmman dingin tangkaruo le râng- kachak ka hung thawn che; thaw ta, Israel lal Baasa hin a min kiensanna dingin a kuoma i thuthlung kha ṭhiek el ta,” tiin a thawn a."
20,"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.","Chun, Benhadad chun lal Asa thu chu a lo pawm a, chuongchun, Israel khuohai chu thaw dingin a sipai hotuhai a tir a. Ijon khuo dâm, Dan khuo dâm, Abel-beth-maaka khuo dâm, Kinneroth biel po po chu, Naphtali ram po po le chun a thawh a."
21,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.","Chun, Baasa chun chu thu chu a lo hriet phingleh Rama khaw siem chu a ma a, Tirza khuoa chun a um tah a."
22,"Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.","Chuongchun, lal Asa chun Judai ram po poa chun thu ân phur vêl tah a; tukhawm a âwl bîk hrim hrim an um nawh, chuongchun, Baasain Rama khaw siemna dinga thing le lung a hmanghai chu an thak a; chuonghai chu hmangin lal Asa chun Mizpa khuo le Benjamin rama Geba khuo a siem a."
23,"Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.","Asa chanchin dang po pohai, a thilthawtheizie po pohai, a thilthaw po pohai, a khaw siemhai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih? Ami- ruokchu, a tar hnung chun a kea chun hri ieng amanih a hung invawi tah a."
24,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Asa chu a puhai kuomah a in tah a, a pu David khawpuiah a puhai lai chun an phûm tah a; a naupa Jehosaphat chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
25,And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.,"Chun, Jeroboam naupa Nadab chu Juda lal Asa inlal kum hninaa chun Israelhai chungah ân lal ṭan a; Israelhai chunga chun kum hni ân lal a."
26,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.","LALPA mithmuin thil ṭha naw- tak a thaw hlak a; a pa lampui hraw chu a hraw veh a, Israelhai thil insuksuoltira a suksuolna kha a thaw veh a."
27,"And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.","Chun, Issakar sûnghai laia mi Ahija naupa Baasa chun ama chu a phier rûk a, Philistin mihai chan, Gibbethon khuoah Baasa chun a that tah a, Nadab le Israelhai po po chun Gibbethon khuo chu an inhuol lai tak a nih."
28,"Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.","Juda lal Asa inlal a kum thumnaah a nih Baasa chun a that a, a aiah ân lal chu."
29,"And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam: he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;","Chun, lal a hung ni phing chun a sukchimit dêr hmakhat chun Jeroboam sûnghai po po chu a that a, a dam taphawt chu pakhat khawm Jeroboam chu a hlapêk nawh a; LALPAIN Shilo khuoa mi a siehlaw Ahija hmanga a lo hril ta ang khan,"
30,"for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation wherewith he provoked Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger.","chu chu Israelhai thil insuk- suoltira a thaw, Jeroboam suolnahai lei le LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu a suklungsen lei a nih."
31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?",Nadab chanchin danghai le a thilthaw po pohai chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?
32,And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.,"Chun, Asa le Israel lal Baasa chu an inlal sûng po chu an indo zing hlak a."
33,"In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty and four years.","Juda lal Asa inlal kum thumnaa chun Ahija naupa Baasa chu Tirza khuoah Israelhai po po chungah ân lal ṭan a, kum sâwmhni le kum li ân lal a."
34,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.","LALPA mithmuin thil ṭhanaw- tak a thaw hlak a, Jeroboam lampui hraw chu a hraw veh a, Israelhai thil insuksuoltirnaa a suksuolna kha a thaw veh a."
