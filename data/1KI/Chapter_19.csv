1,"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.","Ahab chun Elija thilthaw po po, kâwl hnâma zâwlneihai po po a that thuhai leh Jezebel chu a hril a."
2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.","Chuongchun, Jezebel chun Elija kuomah, “khâng mihai laia mi pa- khat hringna anga zîngah hieng tik phât hin i hringna ka siempêk ve naw che chun pathienhai chun an law law mi law el hai sienla, chu nêka nasa lem khawm a,” tiin mi a tir a."
3,"And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.","Chuongchun, a ṭih a, a tho a, a tlânse tah a, Judai rama Beer-seba khuo a va tlung a, chutaka chun a siehlaw chu a mâksan a."
4,"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Jehovah, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.","Ama ruok chu thlalêrah ni khat lama hlaah a feh a, Juniper thing hnuoia hin a ṭhung a, thi a hni tah a, “A hun tah ie, aw LALPA, tuhin ka hringna hi la el ta, ka puhai nêkin ka ṭha chuong bîk si nawh a,” a ta."
5,"And he lay down and slept under a juniper-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.","Chuongchun, Juniper thing hnuoia chun a zâl a, a in tah a; chun, ngai ta, vântirko hin a hung them a, a kuomah, “Tho la, fa rawh,” a ta."
6,"And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.","Chun, a hei en vêl a, ngai ta, a luthluona chun beiphêk lungsaa em hmin diem le tuiûm hi a lo um a. Chuongchun, a fâk a, a dâwn a, a zâl nâwk tah a."
7,"And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for thee.","Chun, LALPA vântirko chu a hung nâwk a, a hung them a, “Tho la, fa rawh, i fena ding i ta dingin lam hla a nih,” a ta."
8,"And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.","Chun, a tho a, a fâkin a dâwn a, chuongchun, chu bu lei chun Pathien tlâng Horeb chenin ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli a feh a."
9,"And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?","Chun, chutaka pûk pakhat a va tlung a, chutaka chun a um tah a; chun, ngai ta, LALPA thu a kuomah a hung tlung a, a kuomah, “Hitaka hin ieng am i thawh a, Elija?” a ta."
10,"And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.","Ama chun, “LALPA sipaihai Pathien ta ding hin ṭhahnem ka ngai êm êm hlak a, Israel thlahai hlak chun i thuthlung an nghatsan a, i maichâmhai an sukchim a, i zâwl- neihai kâwlhnâmin an sâthlum sih a; a la um chu kei bak hi ka na, ka hring- na mi lâkpêk an tum a nih,” a ta."
11,"And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; but Jehovah was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Jehovah was not in the earthquake:","Ama chun, “Va suok la, tlânga sawn LALPA hmaah va ngîr rawh,” a ta. Chun, ngai ta, LALPA chu a hung a, thlipui hrâttakin tlâng dâm chu LALPA hmaa chun a hung mût kak a, lungpuihai chu a kawi remrum a, nisienlakhawm, thlia chun LALPA chu a um nawh; chun, thli hrâng zo chun simkhawleihnuoi a hung in- hnîng a; nisienlakhawm, simkhawlei- hnuoi inhnînga chun LALPA chu a um nawh;"
12,and after the earthquake a fire; but Jehovah was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.,"Chun, simkhawleihnuoi in- hnîng zo chun mei a hung suok a, nisienlakhawm, meia chun LALPA chu a um nawh;"
13,"And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?","chun, mei zoa chun râwl innêmtak el hi a hung suok a, chun, Elija chun chu chu a hriet chun a puonin a hmai ân khum a, a va suok a, pûk baua chun a va ngîr a. Chun, ngai ta, râwl chun a kuomah, “Hitaka hin ieng am i thawh a, Elija?” a hung tih a."
14,"And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.","Chun, ama chun, “LALPA sipai- hai Pathien ta ding hin ṭhahnem ka ngai êm êm hlak a, Israel thlahai hlak chun i thuthlung an nghatsan a, i maichâmhai an sukchim a, i zâwl- neihai kâwlhnâmin an sât hlum sih a; a la um chu keima bak hi ka na, ka hringna mi lâkpêk an tum a nih,” a ta."
15,"And Jehovah said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;","Chun, LALPAIN a kuomah, “Fe nâwk ta la, thlalêr tieng Damaska khuoah fe rawh; i va tlung chun Suria lal dingin Hazael hriek nâl i ta;"
16,and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.,"chun, Israel lal dingin Nimsi naupa Jehu chu hriek nâl bawk i tih; chun, nanga aiawa zâwlnei ni dingin Abelmehola khuoa mi Saphat naupa Elisa hriek nâl bawk i tih."
17,"And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.","Chun, Hazael kâwlhnâm pum- pel taphawt chu Jehu chun that a ta, Jehu kâwlhnâm pumpel taphawt chu Elisa chun that a tih."
18,"Yet will I leave me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.","Nisienlakhawm, Israel rama hin Baal hmaa la dingṭhaṭhuon ngailo le, la fâwp ngailo mi sâng sari ka ta dingin ka hum ding a nih,” a ta."
19,"So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him.","Chuongchun, chutaka inthawk chun a suok tah a, Saphat naupa Elisa chu a va hmusuok a, ama chun hnuoi a lo inlet a, a hmaa chun sebâwng tuok sâwm le tuok hni a um a, a sâwm le pahnina chu ama chun a lo khal a; chun, Elija chun a va pan a, a puon chu a vân bâttir a."
20,"And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?","Chun, sebâwnghai chu a mâk- san a, Elija chu a hnawt tah a, “Ka nu le ka pa la va fâwp hri phawt ka tih aw, chuongchun, hung zui ka ti che,” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “Va fe nâwk phawt ta la, ieng am ka thawpêk che a?” a ta."
21,"And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.","Chun, ama a va zui chu a kîr a, sebâwng tuok khat a khal chu a that a, a sa chu sebâwng thuomhnawhai chun a suong a, mihai kuomah a sem a, an fâk tah a. Chuongchun, a tho a, Elija chu a zui a, a rawng a bâwlpêk tah a."
