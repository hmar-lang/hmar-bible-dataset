1,And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.,"Chun, Rehoboam chu Sekem khuoah a feh a, Israelhai po po chu Sekem khuoa chun ama lala siem dingin an fe ta sih a."
2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,","Chun, Nebat naupa Jeroboam chun chuong thu chu a lo hriet chun (lal Solomona inthawka a tlânhmang- na Aigupta rama la um a na, chuong- chun Jeroboam Aigupta rama la um zing chu an zûn kotir a),"
3,"and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,","Jeroboam le sipai pungkhâwm- hai po po chu an hung a, Rehoboam kuoma chun,"
4,"Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.","“I pa khan kan rîngkawl a sukrik êm hlak a, chuleiin, i pa mi sawr rimsikna le, a rîngkawl riktak kan chunga ân nghat hi mi sukzângpêk la, chuongchun, i rawng bâwl kan tih,” tiin an hung hril a."
5,"And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ni thum sûng chu lo va fe kieng phawt unla, chun, ka kuomah hung nâwk ro,” a ta. Chun, mipuihai chu an fe kieng ta phawt a."
6,"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?","Chun, lal Rehoboam chun a pa Solomon dam laia a kâwla um hlak upahai chu, “Hieng mipuihai hi ka dawn dân ding remchâng ieng am mi ruotpui in ta le?” a ta."
7,"And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Tuhin hienghai siehlawa hin i um a, an rawng i bâwl a, anni chu i dawn a, an kuoma thu ṭhatak hril i tum chun, kumkhawtluongin i siehlawah um an tih,” tiin an hril a."
8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.","Nisienlakhawm, upahai rem- ruotpui chu a pawm nawh a, ama ruolpui tlângvâlhai, ama kâwla um hlakhai chu a râwn ta lem a."
9,"And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?","An kuoma chun, “Hieng mipui- hai, ka kuoma, ‘I pain ka chunga rîngkawl ân nghat hi mi sukzângpêk rawh,’ tiha hriltuhai hi ka dawn dân ding rem ieng am in mi ruotpuia le?” a tih a."
10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.","Chun, ama ruolpui tlangvâlhai chun a kuomah, “Hieng mipuihai, ‘I pa khan kan rîngkawl a sukrik êm hlak a, nang chun chu mi sukzângpêk raw khai,’ i kuoma tituhai kuoma chun, hieng ang hin ti la, hieng ang hin an kuoma chun hril rawh, ‘Ka pa kâwng nêk chun ka kutte khawm hi a lien lem a."
11,"And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.","Ka pa khan rîngkawl riktak a lo inbâttir cheu a, kei chun in rîngkawl chu ka belsa ding a nih, ka pa chun vuoknain a lo hrâwk hlak cheu a, kei ruok chun chu ainuvêtin ka hrâwk ding cheu a nih,’ tiin,” an hril a."
12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.","Chuongchun, Jeroboam le mi- puihai po po chu lalin, ni thum chinah ka kuomah hung nâwk ro tia a hril ang khan a ni thum ni chun Rehoboam kuoma chun an va feh a."
13,"And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,","Chun, lal chun mipuihai chu inrumtakin a lo dawn a, upahai rem- ruotpui kha a pawm nawh a,"
14,"and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.","tlangvâlhai remruotpui ang khan, “Ka pa chun in rîngkawl a lo sukrik a, kei chun chu in rîngkawl chu ka belsa ding a nih, ka pa chun vuoknain a lo hrâwk hlak cheu a, kei chun chu ainuvêtin ka hrâwk lem ding cheu a nih,” a ta."
15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","Chuongchun, lal chun, mipuihai thuhril kha a pawm ta nawh a, chu chu LALPA lei a nih, LALPA chun Silo mi Ahija hmanga, Nebat naupa Jeroboam kuoma a thu lo hril ta kha a suknghet theina dingin."
16,"And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.","Chun, Israelhai po po chun lalin an thuhril a pawm nawh ti an hrietin, mipuihai chun, “David a hin chanvo ieng am ei nei leh? Jesai naupaa hin rohluo ding ei nei chuong bawk nawh: Aw Israelhai, in puon in tieng fe vawng ro, David, i sûngkuo chu ngai- tuo el rawh,” tiin lal chu an dawn a. Chuongchun, Israelhai chu an puon in tieng chun an fe tah a."
17,"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.",Israel thla Juda ram khuoa umhai chunga ruok chun Rehoboam chun ro a rêl a.
18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, lal Rehoboam chun sinthawa ruoi luihai hotu Ado- niram chu a tir a, ama chu Israelhai po po chun lungin an lo dêng a, a thi tah a. Chun, lal Rehoboam chu Jeru- salem khuoa tlân hmang tumin a taw lailîra chun a chuong kai vat tah a."
19,So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.,"Chuongchun, Israelhai chu David sûnghai chunga chun an hung hel tah a nih, tu chen el hin."
20,"And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.","Chun, Israelhai po po chun Jeroboam chu a hung kîr nâwk ti an hrietin, pungkhâwmnaa hung dingin an inkotir a, Israelhai po po chunga lalah an siem tah a; Juda hnam ti chau naw chu David sûnghai zui tukhawm an um nawh."
21,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.","Chun, Rehoboam chun Jerusa- lem khuo a hang tlung chun, Israel sûnghai chu doa Solomon naupa Rehoboam ram la nâwk dingin Juda sûnghai po po le Benjamin hnam mi huoisen ruok thlang suok, nuoi khat le sîng riet zet ân khâwm a."
22,"But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien mi Semaia kuomah Pathien thu a hung tlung a,"
23,"Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,","“Judai ram lal Solomon naupa Rehoboam le Juda le Benjamin sûng- hai po po kuoma le mipui danghai kuoma chun,"
24,"Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the word of Jehovah, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Jehovah.","‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, Hang fe naw rawh, Israel thla in unauhai chu hang do bawk naw ro, mâni in tieng seng fe nâwk ta ro, hi hi keima thaw a nih,’ tiin hril rawh,” tiin. Chuongchun, LALPA thu chu an awi a, LALPA thu ang chun an kîr a, an fe nâwk ta vawng a."
25,"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel.","Chuongchun, Jeroboam chun Ephraim tlâng rama chun Sekem khuo a siem a, chutaka chun a um a, chun, chutaka inthawk chun a suok a, Penuel khuo a siem a."
26,"And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David:","Chun, Jeroboam chun a lung- rilin, “Ram hi David sûnghai ta hi a hung ni nâwk el âwm ie,"
27,"if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.","hienghairawi hi Jerusalem khuoa LALPA ina inthâwinahai in- hlân dinga an hang fe chun hienghai lungril hi an lalpa Rehoboam, Juda ram lal tieng hin thle nâwk el a ta, chuongchun, kei hi mi that an ta, Juda ram lal Rehoboam tieng an kawp nâwk el âwm ie,” a ta."
28,"Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.","Chuongchun, lal chun mi a râwn a, rângkachak bâwngte lim, pa- hni a siem a, an kuoma chun, “In ta dingin Jerusalem khuoa hang fe chu ân tak talaw êm a, aw Israelhai, en ta u; Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu cheu in pathienhai hi,” a ta."
29,"And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.","Chun, pakhat chu Bethelah a sieh a, pakhat chu Danah a sieh a."
30,"And this thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.","Chu thil chu suol a hung ni ta a nih, mipuihai chu an pahnia be ding chun Dan chen rauin an va fe hlak sih a."
31,"And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi.","Chun, bâwlhmun inhai a bâwl a, Levi nauhai ni lo, vântlâng laia mihai thiempuah a siem a."
32,"And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places that he had made.","Chun, Jeroboam chun Juda rama ruoiṭhe an nei hlak ang bawkin thla rietna, chu thla ni sâwm le ni nga ni chu ruoiṭhe niah a ruot veh a, maichâma chun an hang feh a, Bethela chun a bâwngte lim siem kâwla inthâwiin chuong ang chun an thaw a nih; chun, a siem bâwl- hmun thiempuhai chu Bethela chun a sieh a."
33,"And he went up unto the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up unto the altar, to burn incense.","Chun, amain a dit anga a ruot thla ngei, thla rietna, ni sâwm le ni nga nia chun Bethela a maichâm siema chun a hang feh a, chun, Israel thlahai ta dingin ruoiṭhe ni a ruot a, maichâma riminhnik raw dingin a hang feh a."
