1,"Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.","Tûn lal David chu a kumhai a hung tam a, a hung tar ta hleh a, chuongchun, puonhaiin ama chu an inkhum hlak a, nisienlakhawm, a lum thei chuong nawh a."
2,"Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.","Chuongchun, a siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Ka lalpa lal ta ding hinnunghâk tleirawl zawng ei tiu khai, lal bula hin um zing sienla, enkawl raw se; chun, i ângsûnga hin hung zâl sienla, ka lalpa hi a lum thei ding a nih,” an tih a."
3,"So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.","Chuongchun, Israel ram sûng po poa chun nunghâk hmêlṭha an zawng tah a; Sunam mi Abisag chu an va hmuh a, lal kuoma chun an hung ṭhuoi tah a."
4,"And the damsel was very fair; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.","Nunghâk chu a hmêl a ṭha hle el a, lal chu a enkawl a, a rawng a bâwlpêk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, lal chun a pâwl nawh a."
5,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.","Chun, Haggith naupa Adonija chu ama le ama inchawisângin, “Kei hi lal ka la ni ngei âwm hi maw,” a ta, tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai, mi sâwmnga a hmaa tlân dinghai leh a buotsai a."
6,"And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.","A pa hlak chun ieng lai khawma, “Iengdinga hienga i thaw am a ni leh?” tiin a suklungawi naw ngai si nawh a; chun, ama hi hmêl ṭhatak a na, Absalom hnuoia mi a nih."
7,"And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.","Ama chun Zeruia naupa Joab le thiempu Abiathar chu a râwn a, anni chu Adonija tieng chun an ṭhang a, an ṭhangpui hlak a."
8,"But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.","Thiempu Zadok hai, Jehoiada naupa Benaia hai, zâwlnei Nathan hai, Simei hai, Rei hai le David mi huoisenhai ruok chu Adonija tieng an ṭhang ve nawh a."
9,"And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants:","Chun, Adonija chun berâmhai, sebâwngchalhai, ran châwm thâuhai Zoheleth lungah a that a; chu chu En-rogel bula um a nih; chun, lal naupahai, a unauhai po po le, Juda rama lal upahai po po chu a fiel a."
10,"but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.","Zâwlnei Nathan hai, Benaia hai, mi huoisenhai le a unaupa Solomon ruok chu a fiel ve nawh a."
11,"Then Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?","Chuongchun, Nathan chun Solomon nu Bathseba kuoma chun, “Haggith naupa Adonija hi ei lalpa David hriet loin ân lal el a ni ta hi ti i hriet naw am a nih?"
12,"Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.","Chuongchun, nangma himna ding le i naupa Solomon himna ding lo hril ka ti che."
13,"Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?","Lal David kuoma chun va lût la, a kuomah, ‘Aw lalpa ka pu, i suoknu kuoma hin i naupa Solomon hi ka hnungah ân lal ngei ngei ding a na, ama hi ka lalṭhungphaa hin a la ṭhung ding a nih, ti khan ṭawng în khâm a ni naw am a ni kha? Ieng- dinga Adonija hi lala um el am a ni ta leh?’ va ti hrim ta."
14,"Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.","Ngai ta, lal i va biek lai tak chun kei khawma hung zui lût vêng ka ti cheh a, i thuhril chu ka hung sukdet- pui ding che a nih,” tiin a hril a."
15,And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.,"Chun, Bathseba chu lal pindana chun a va lût tah a, lal chu a upa ta hle el a, Sunam mi Abisag chun lal rawng chu a lo bâwl a."
16,"And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?","Bathseba chun kûnin lal chu chibai a bûk a. Chun, lal chun, “Ieng am i dit a?” a lo tih a."
17,"And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by Jehovah thy God unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.","Ama chun, “Ka lalpa, LALPA i Pathien hming sâlin i suoknu kuoma hin, ‘I naupa Solomon hi ka hnungah ân lal ngei ngei ding a na, ama hi ka lalṭhungphaa hin a la ṭhung ding a nih,’ ti khan ṭawng în khâm tah a."
18,"And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not:","Nisienlakhawm, ngai ta, tuhin Adonija chun ro a rêl ta hi, lalpa nang ka pu hlaka i hriet si nawh a;"
19,"and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.","bâwngchalhai, ran châwm thâuhai, berâmhai a that ṭeu a, lal naupahai po po le thiempu Abiathar le sipai pâwl hotu Joab a ko a; nisien- lakhawm, i siehlaw Solomon ruok hi chu a ko ve naw a nih."
20,"And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.","Chuongchun, ka pu lalpa hnunga hin lalṭhungphaah tu am a ṭhung ding a na ti i hril theina dingin Israelhai po po mit hi nang ka pu chunga hin a fu ṭhuop el a ni hi."
21,"Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.","Chuong naw chun chu hieng hi hung nîng a ta, ka pu lal hi a puhai kuoma a in ve pha chun, kei le ka naupa Solomon hi thil suksuoltuah an mi ruot el ding a ni hi,” a ta."
22,"And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.","Chun, chuonga lal kuoma thu a la hril zing lai chun zâwlnei, Nathan chu a va lût veh a;"
23,"And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.","“En ta, zâwlnei Nathan a hung ie,” tiin lal chu an hril a. Chun, lal kuom a va tlung chun, lal hmaa chun a hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a."
24,"And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?","Chun, Nathan chun, “Aw lalpa ka pu, ‘Keia hnungah Adonija hi inlal a ta, ka lalṭhungphaah ṭhung a tih,’ i ti am a nih?"
25,"For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, Long live king Adonijah.","Vawisûn hin a fe thlah a, ran châwm thâuhai, bâwngchalhai, be- râmhai a that ṭeu a, lal naupahai po po le sipai hotuhai le, thiempu Abiathar hai dâm a fiel a, chun, ngai ta, an dâwnin an fâk tâwl a, ‘Pathien chun lal Adonija hi humhim raw se,’ an ti a nih."
26,"But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.","Nisienlakhawm, kei i siehlaw ngei le, thiempu Zadok le Jehoiada naupa Benaia le i siehlaw Solomon hi chu an mi fiel ve nawh a."
27,"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?","Hi thil hi ka pu lalpa thilthaw a ni si chun, ka pu lalpa hnunga hin i lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ding chu a tu tak am a ni i siehlawhai hi i lân hriettir naw hrim nîng a ti maw?” a ta."
28,"Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.","Chuongchun, lal David chun a dawn a, “Bathseba mi hung kopêk ro,” a tih a. Chun, lal kuoma chun a va feh a, lal hmaa chun a va ngîr a."
29,"And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,","Chun, lal chun ṭawng inkhâm- in, “Lunginzîngna po poa ka hringna humhimtu LALPA hringna sâlin,"
30,"verily as I sware unto thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.","i kuoma Israelhai LALPA hming sâla, ‘I naupa Solomon hi ka hnunga chun lân lal ngei ngei a ta, keia aiah ka lalṭhungphaa hin a la ṭhung ding a nih,’ tiha ṭawng kân khâm ang ngei khan, vawisûn ngei hin ka thaw ding a nih,” a ta."
31,"Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.","Chuongchun, Bathseba chu a hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a, lal chu chibai a bûk a, “Ka pu lal David hi kumkhawtluongin dam zing raw se,” a ta."
32,"And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.","Chun, lal David chun, “Thiempu Zadok hai, zâwlnei Nathan hai, Jehoiada naupa Benaia hai mi hung kopêk ro,” a ta. Chun, anni chu lal hmaa chun an va fe tah a."
33,"And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:","Chun, lal chun an kuomah, “In lalpa siehlawhai hi ṭhuoi unla, chun, ka naupa Solomon hi keima sabeng- tung lien chia ngei inchuongtir unla, Gihonah ṭhuoi thla ro,"
34,"and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye the trumpet, and say, Long live king Solomon.","chun, chutaka chun thiempu Zadok le zâwlnei Nathanin ama chu Israelhai po po chunga lal dingin hriek zu nâl raw hai se, chun, in tawtawrâwthai mût in ta, ‘Pathienin lal Solomon hi humhim raw se,’ ti ro."
35,"Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.","Chuongchun, ama chu hung zui in ta, ka lalṭhungphaa hin a hung ṭhung ding a nih, ama hi ka aia lal ding a ni sih a; chun, ama hi Israel ram le Juda ram lal dinga ka ruot a nih,” a ta."
36,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so too.","Chun, Jehoiada naupa Benaia chun lal chu a dawn a, “Amen, LALPA ka pu lalpa Pathien khawma remti raw se."
37,"As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.","LALPA chu ka pu lalpa kuoma hin a um hlak angin, Solomon kuoma khawm um ve pei sienla, ka pu lal David lalṭhungpha nêkin a lalṭhung- pha chu sukropui lem raw se,” a ta."
38,"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.","Chuongchun, thiempu Zadok hai, zâwlnei Nathan hai, Jehoiada naupa Benaia hai, Kereth mihai, Peleth mihai chu an zu feh a, Solomon chu David sabengtung chunga chun an inchuongtir a, Gihon hmuna chun an ṭhuoi a."
39,"And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon.","Chun, thiempu Zadok chun Puon ina inthawkin hriek siena ki chu a lâk a, Solomon chu a nâl tah a. Chun, tawtawrâwt an mût a, chuong- chun, mi po po chun, “Pathienin lal Solomon hi humhim raw se,” an tih a."
40,"And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.","Chun, mipuihai po po chun ama chu an zui a, mipuihai chun theihle dâm an mût a, an lâwm nasa khawp a, an rihâu chun hnuoi chu a nghawr kak hiel a."
41,"And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?","Chun, Adonija le mi fielhai a kuoma umhai po po chun an ruoiṭhe zo chun an hei hriet a. Chun, Joab chun tawtawrâwt mût rîk a hei hriet chun, “Khawpui sûnga ri nasatak um ta dur dur el chu iengtizie am a ni ta leh?” a ta."
42,"While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.","Chuonga a ti lai tak chun ngai ta, thiempu Abiathar naupa Jona- than a hung a, Adonija chun, “La hung ta khai, nang chu chu mi fel i na, chanchin ṭha intlun ngei i tih,” a lo tih a."
43,"And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king:","Chun, Jonathan chun a dawn a, Adonija kuoma chun, “Tlun lo e, ei pu lal David chun Solomon lalah a siem tah annâwm ie,"
44,"and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule;","ama ruol chun thiempu Zadok hai, zâwlnei Nathan hai, Jehoiada naupa Benaia hai, Kereth mihai, Peleth mihai lalin a tir a, lal sakawr chungah an inchuongtir tah a:"
45,"and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.","chun, thiempu Zadok le zâwlnei Nathanin Gihon hmunah lal dingin hriek an nâl tah a, chutaka inthawk chun hlimtakin an hung a, chu ri chun khawpui sûng chu a khâwk rum rum el a nih. Chu chu a nih in ri hriet chu."
46,And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.,"Chun, Solomon chu hi ram lal- ṭhungphaa chun a ṭhung ta bawk a."
47,"And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed.","Chun, lal siehlawhai chun, ‘I Pathienin i hming nêkin Solomon hming chu sukṭha sienla, i lalṭhung- pha nêkin Solomon a lalṭhungpha chu sukropui lem raw se,’ tiha ei lal David chu lâwmpui dingin an fe huoi huoi bawk a; chun, lal chu khum sikin a lo kûn pei bawk a."
48,"And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.","Chun, lal khawm chun hieng ang hin a tih a, ‘LALPA Israelhai Pathien, vawisûn ngeia ka lalṭhung- phaa ṭhung ding hung ruottu chu inpâkin um raw se, ka mit ngeiin a hmu ta hi, tiin,’” a ta."
49,"And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.","Chun, Adonija mi fielhai po po chun an ṭi tah a, an tho a, mâni lampui sengah an fe ta vawng a."
50,"And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.","Chun, Adonija chun Solomon chu a ṭi tah a, a tho a, maichâm ki a va chel tah a."
51,"And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.","Chun, “Ngai ta, Adonija chun lal Solomon a ṭih a, ‘Lal Solomon hin a siehlaw kâwlhnâma sukhlum lo dingin ka kuomah ṭawng inkhâm phawt raw se,’ tiin maichâm ki a chel ie,” tiin Solomon chu an hril a."
52,"And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.","Solomon chun, “Mi ringumtak a ni ti a suklang phawt chun a sam zâi khat khawm hnuoiah tla naw nih, amiruokchu, rîtlona a nei ti hriet a ni ruok chun thîng a tih,” a ta."
53,"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.","Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun mi a tir a, maichâma inthawk chun an va ṭhuoi tah a. Chun, a va feh a, Solomon chu chibai a bûk a, Solomon chun a kuomah, “I inah fe ta raw khai,” a lo tih a."
