1,And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.,"Chun, kum thum sûng chu Suriahai le Israelhai chu indo loin an um a."
2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.","Chun, a kum thum kum chun Juda lal Jehosaphat chu Israel lal kuomah a zu feh a."
3,"And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?","Israel lal chun a siehlawhai kuomah, “Ramoth-gilead khuo hi eini ta a nih ti hre zing sih a, iengtizieha Suria lal hi lâkpêk loa um am ei ni aw?” a ta. Chun, Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Ramoth-gilead khuo hi mi hang thawpui ve nuom i tim chu?” a ta."
4,"And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.","Chun, Jehosaphat chun Israel lal kuoma chun, “Kei le nang, i mihai le ka mihai chu pumkhat ei na, ka sakawrhai le i sakawrhai chu pum- khat an nih annâwm,” a ta."
5,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.","Chun, Jehosaphat chun Israel lal kuoma chun, “LALPA thu chu la ngai hri phawt la tie,” a ta."
6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chuongchun, Israel lal chun zâwlneihai mi za li lai a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, “Ramoth-gilead khuo hi thaw dingin ka hang inthawk ding am inthawk lo ding?” a ta. Anni chun, “Hang inthawk rawh, LALPAIN lal kuta hin a pêk ding a nih,” an ta."
7,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?","Nisienlakhawm, Jehosaphat chun, “Hitaka hin LALPA zâwlnei dang tu amani bêk ka hang râwn ding hi an um naw am a ni aw?” a ta."
8,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.","Chun, Israel lal chun Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “LALPA mi râwnpêk ding Imla naupa Mikaia kha chu a la um kha maw, nisienlakhawm, ama hi chu ka theida zâwngtak a nih; ka chungchâng thu hi a se tieng ngawt naw chu a ṭha tieng a hril hrim hrim ngai nawh,” a ta. Chun, Jehosaphat chun, “Lal hin chuong ang chun chu ti naw raw se khai,” a ta."
9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.","Chuongchun, Israel lal chun hotu pakhat a hang ko a, “Imla naupa Mikaia kha hung ṭhuoi vak ta,” a ta."
10,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.","Chun, Israel lal le Juda lal Jehosaphat chu Samari khaw kul kawtkhâr lûtna bula hrizâwla chun an lal puona inthuomin an lalṭhung- pha ve vea chun an ṭhung a; chun, zâwlneihai po po chun an hmaa chun thu an hril a."
11,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.","Chun, Kenaan naupa Zedekia chun thîr kihai a siempêk a, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Hienghai hin Suria mihai chu chimit dêr khawpin sik i tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
12,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chuong ang bawkin zâwlnei po pohai chun, “Ramoth-gileada chun hang fe la, hang hlawtling raw khai, LALPA chun lal kuta hin a pêk ding a nih,” tiin an hril a."
13,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.","Chun, Mikaia va ko dinga an tir chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta khai, zâwl- neihai hin thu inang vawngin a ṭha tiengin lal kuoma hin thu an hril seng a, an hril ta ang seng chun hang hril ve la, a ṭha tiengin hang hril ve rawh aw,” tiin a hril a."
14,"And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak.","Mikaia ruok chun, “LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, LALPAIN ka kuoma a hril chu a nih ka hang hril ding chu,” a ta."
15,"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chun, lal kuoma a hang tlung chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Mikaia, Ramoth-gilead khuo thaw dingin ka hang inthawk ding am a ni, hang inthawk lo ding?” a ta. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Hang inthawk la, hang hlawtling raw khai, LALPA chun lal kutah a pêk ding a nih,” a ta."
16,"And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Thu- tak ngawt naw chu LALPA hminga ka kuoma hril lo dingin vawi iengzât rau am ṭawng kân khâmtir ding che a ni leh?” a ta."
17,"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.","Chun, ama chun, “Israelhai po po vêngtu neilo berâm angin tlânga an indar vawng ka hmuh a, LALPA- IN, ‘Hienghai hin hotu an nei ta nawh a, mi tin mâni in tieng seng lung- muongtakin fe diel el ta raw hai se,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
18,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?","Chun, Israel lal chun Jeho- saphat kuomah, “Ka chungchâng thu hi a se tieng ngawt naw chu a ṭha tieng hrim hrim chu hril naw ni ti ka hril che a ni naw am a ni kha?” a ta."
19,"And Micaiah said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.","Chun, Mikaia chun, “Chuleiin, LALPA thu hi lo ngai ta u, LALPA chu a lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ka hmuh a, vâna mipuihai po po, a changtieng le vawitienga ngîrhai leh."
20,"And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner.","Chun, LALPAIN, ‘Ahab hi Ramoth-gilead khuoa hang feh a, râla thi dingin tuin am thlêm an ta?’ a ti a nih, pakhatin hieng hin a ta, mi dangin chuong chun a ta."
21,"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.","Chuongchun, thlarau pakhat hi a hung suok a, LALPA hmaa chun a ngîr a, ‘Keiin thlêm ka tih,’ a ta."
22,"And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.","Chun, LALPAIN a kuomah, ‘Iengtin am ie?’ a ta. Chun, ama chun, ‘Va fêng ka ta, zâwlnei po pohai hmûra chun thlarau khêlinhlipah vân chang ka tih,’ a ta. Chun, ama chun, ‘Thlêm ngei i ta, hlaw khawm hlawtling ngei i tih, va fe la, chuong ang chun va thaw raw leh,’ a ta."
23,"Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.","Chuongchun, ngai ta, LALPAIN hieng i zâwlneihai po po hmûra hin thlarau khêlinhlip a sieh a, i chungchâng thu hi a ṭha naw tiengin LALPAIN a hril tah a nih,” a ta."
24,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?","Chuongchun, Kenaan naupa Zedekia chun a hung hnai a, Mikaia bienga chun a hung ben a, “LALPA thlarau chun i kuoma thu hril dingin khawtieng am a mi mâksan leh?” a ta."
25,"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.","Mikaia chun, “Ngai rawh, pin- dan sûngrila inbi dinga i lût ni chun la hrieng i tih,” a ta."
26,"And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;","Chun, Israel lal chun, “Mikaia hi ṭhuoi unla, khawpui awptu Amon le lal naupa Joas kuomah fepui ta u;"
27,"and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.","chun, lalin hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Hi mipa hi lung inah khum unla, lungmuongtaka ka hung nâwk hma- khat chun rinumna tui lo pe ro,’ tiin, ti ro,” a ta."
28,"And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.","Chun, Mikaia chun, “Lung- muongtaka i hung nâwk tâk leh, LALPAIN kei mi hmang hin thu a hril naw nîng a tih,” a ta. Chun, ama ma chun, “Nangni mipuihai, in rêngin lo hre seng ro,” a ta."
29,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.,"Chuongchun, Israel lal le Juda lal Jehosaphat chu Ramoth-gileada chun an hang feh a."
30,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.","Chun, Israel lal chun Jehosa- phat kuomah, “Insiem danglam ka ta, indonaa chun hang fe vêng ka tih a, nang ruok chun chu i lal puon sil la,” a ta. Chuongchun, Israel lal chu ân siem danglam a, indonaa chun a hang feh a."
31,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.","Chun, Suria lal chun a tawlailîr chunga hotu sâwmthum le pahnihai kuoma chun, “Israel lal ngawt naw chu, mi lien khawm, mi chîn khawm a tu tukhawm thaw naw ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.","Chun, tawlailîr chunga hotuhai chun Jehosaphat an hei hmu chun, “Israel lal a ni ngei el leh,” an ta; chuongchun, thaw tum chun an inhuol tah a; chun, Jehosaphat chu a khêk suok a."
33,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.","Chun, tawlailîr chunga hotuhai chun Israel lal a ni nawh ti an hriet chun, an hnawt lai chu an lêt nâwk tah a."
34,"And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.","Chun, mi pakhat hin tum bîk neilo hin a thalngul a kuoi a, Israel lal chu âwmphaw le âwmphaw inkârah a kâp a, chuongchun, a tawlailîr khaltu kuoma chun, “Kei her la, sipaihai laia inthawk hi mi suokpui raw khai, hliemna natak ka tuok ta hi,” a ta."
35,"And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.","Chun, chu ni chun inthawna chu a nasa ta hle el a, lal chu a tawlailîra chun Suria mihai hmua chun an inngîrtir a, chun, zântieng chun a thi tah a; ama inhliemnaa inthawk chun thisen chu tawlailîr sûnga chun a luong dup dup a."
36,"And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.","Chun, nisa tlâk tâwm lai vêl chun, sipaihai lai chun, “Mi tin mâni in tieng seng, mi tin mâni ram tieng seng fe vawng ta raw hai se,” tiin an khêk vêl ta rak el a."
37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.","Chuongchun, lal chu a thi tah a, Samari khuoa chun an lûtpui a; Samari khuoa chun lal chu an phûm tah a."
38,And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves there); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake.,"Chun, Samari khaw dil panga chun tawlailîr chu an sâwp a; chun, LALPA thu hril ta ang ngei khan a thisen chu uiin an liek tah a; (chutaka chun nawchizawrhai chu an insâwp hlak)."
39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Chuongchun, Ahab chanchin danghai, a thilthaw po pohai, a saiha in bâwl dâm, a khaw siemhai po po chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
40,So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.,"Chuongchun, Ahab chu a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a; chun, a nau- pa Ahazia chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
41,And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.,"Chun, Israel lal Ahab inlal kum linaah Asa naupa Jehosaphat chu Judahai chunga chun ân lal ṭan a."
42,Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.,"Jehosaphat chu ân lal ṭan lai chun kum sâwmthum le kum nga a na; Jerusalem khuoa chun kum sâwmhni le kum nga ro a rêl a. A nu hming chu Azuba, Silhi naunu a nih."
43,"And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.","A pa Asa lampui hraw po po chu a hraw veh a; pêtsan dêr loin LALPA mithmuah thilṭha a thaw hlak a, bâwlhmunhai chu a sukbo vawng nawh a, bâwlhmunahai chun mihai chu an inthâwiin riminhnikhai chu an la raw zing hlak a."
44,And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.,"Chun, Jehosaphat chun Israel lal le inremna a siem a."
45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Jehosaphat chan- chin danghai dâm, a thilthawtheizie a suklang thuhai dâm, a râl do thu- hai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
46,"And the remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.","Chun, a pa Asa dam laia pasal inzawrhai a la umhai kha a rama inthawkin a hnawt suok vawng a."
47,And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.,"Chun, Edom rama chun lal an um nawh a, lal aiawtu chun ro a rêl a."
48,Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.,"Jehosaphat chun Ophira râng- kachak phur ding Tarsis lawnghai a tuk a, nisienlakhawm, an fe ta nawh a; Ezion-geber hmuna chun lawnghai chu a se ta vawng sih a."
49,"Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.","Chuongchun, Ahab naupa Aha- zia chun Jehosaphat kuomah, “Ka mihai hi i mihai leh lawngah fe hmunkhat raw hai se chu,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, Jehosaphat chun a remti nawh a."
50,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Jehosaphat chu a puhai kuomah a in tah a, a puhai lai, a pu David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a; chun, a naupa Jehoram chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
51,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.","Chun, Juda lal Jehosaphat inlal kum sâwm le kum sari kum chun Ahab naupa Ahazia chu Samari khuoa chun Israelhai chungah ân lal ṭan a; Israelhai chunga chun kum hni ân lal a."
52,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin.","Chun, LALPA mithmua chun thil ṭhanaw a thaw hlak a, a nu le a pa lampui hrawhai, Nebat naupa Israel- hai thil insuksuoltirtu Jeroboam lampui hrawhai chu a hraw ve hlak a."
53,"And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.","Chun, a pa thaw ang taphawt thawin Baal rawng a bâwl a, a biek hlak a, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu a suklungsen hlak."
