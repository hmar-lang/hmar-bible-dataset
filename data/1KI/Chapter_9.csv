1,"And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,","Chun, Solomon chun LALPA in le lal in a bâwl a, Solomon chun a tum po po hrâttaka a thaw zo vawng hnung chun,"
2,"that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.",Gibeon khuoa a kuoma ân lâr ang khan LALPA chu Solomon kuomah a hung inlâr nâwk a.
3,"And Jehovah said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.","Chun, LALPA chun a kuomah, “I ṭawngṭaina le i hnina ka hmaa i hung intlunhai kha ka lo ngai a, hi in i bâwl hi kumkhuoa ka hming inumtirna dingin ka sukthieng tah; ka mit le ka lungril chu chutaka chun kumkhuoin um tâng a tih."
4,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;","Chun, nang khawm hi thu ka pêk ang taphawt chea thaw dinga i pa David um anga lungril ṭhatak put le lungril indiktak puta ka mithmua i uma, ka thuruothai le ka rorêlhai i pawm zing chun."
5,"then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.","Israelhai chunga hin i ram lalṭhungpha chu kumkhuoa dingin suknghet ka tih, i pa David kuoma, ‘Israelhai lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ding tlasam naw ti nih,’ tia ka lo tiem ta ang khan."
6,"But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;","Amiruokchu, nangniin amanih, in thlahaiin amanih in mi zui chu in mi kîrsan a, ka thupêkhai le ka thu- ruothai kân hriettirhai cheu hi in pawm nawh a, pathien danghai rawng dâm in va bâwl a, in va biek chun,"
7,"then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.","Israelhai hi ram ka pêka inthawk hin sukbohmang ka ta; chun, hi in ka hming dinga ka sukthieng ta sa hi ka mithmu phâk nawah sawnhmang dai ka tih; chuongchun, Israelhai hi hnam tinrênghai laia chun tielna le a se tieng hrilkhinaa hmang la nîng an ta;"
8,"And though this house is so high, yet shall every one that passeth by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?","chun, hi in hi insâng hle sienkhawm, a fe khêl taphawthai chun maktiin lân hui an ta, ‘Ieng- dinga LALPAIN hi ram le hi in hi hieng ang lâwma a thaw am a na?’ la tîng an tih."
9,"and they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath Jehovah brought all this evil upon them.","Chun, mihaiin, ‘LALPA an Pathien, an puhai Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu kha an mâksan a, pathien danghai an chel a, an biek a, an rawnghai an bâwl ta lei a nih; chuleiin, LALPAIN hieng sietna po po hi an chungah a hung intlungtir tah a ni hi,’ tiin la dawn an tih,” a ta."
10,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king’s house","Chun, Solomon chun in pahni, LALPA in le lal in a bâwl sûng, kum sâwmhni an vawi hnungin"
11,"(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.","(Tura lal Hiram chun Solomon chu sidar thinghai, fâr thinghai, rângkachakhai a mamaw taphawt a tum vawng a na,) lal Solomon chun Hiram chu Galili rama khaw sâwm- hni a pêk a."
12,And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.,"Chun, Hiram chu Turaa in- thawk chun Solomonin khuo a pêkhai chu en dingin a suok a, a ditzâwng a ni naw hleh a."
13,"And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka unaupa, hieng i khaw mi pêkhai hi ieng khuo am an ni tâwl leh?” a ta. Chuong- chun, tu chen hin Kabul ram an ti tah a nih."
14,And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.,"Chun, Hiram chun lal chu râng- kachak talent za le sâwmhni a thawn a."
15,"And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.","Lal Solomonin sinthawa ruoi lui pâwl a siemna san chu hi hi a nih; LALPA in le ama in bâwltu ding le, Millo dâm, Jerusalem kul dâm, Hazor khuo dâm, Megiddo khuo dâm, Gezer khuo dâm siemtu dingin a nih."
16,"Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.","Aigupta lal Pharao chu a hang feh a, Gezer khuo a hang lâk a, a rawh a, chu khuoa um Kanaan mihai chu a that a, a naunu Solomon nuhmei chu thuom thilpêka a lo pêk tah a nih."
17,"And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,","Chun, Solomon chun Gezer khuo dâm, Beth-horon khuo thlang hnung lem dâm,"
18,"and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,","Baalath khuo dâm, Israel rama thlalêr rama Tamar khuo dâm,"
19,"and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.","Solomonin thil siekhâwmna a nei khuo po po dâm, a tawlailîr siena khuo dâm, a sakawr chung chuong mihai siena khuohai dâm, Jerusalem khuoa dâm, Lebanona dâm, a rorêlna ram sûng po poa Solomonin ân hawi- tirna dinga siem a tumhai po po chu a lo siem tah a na."
20,"As for all the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;","Chun, Israel thlahai ni ve lo, Amor mihai, Hit mihai, Periz mihai, Jebus mihai a la um sunhai po po kha,"
21,"their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day.","an thlahai chuong rama la um, Israel thlahaiin an sukbohmang vawng thei nawhai laia chun Solomonin siehlaw, sinthawa ruoi lui pâwl a siem a, tu chen hin a la nih."
22,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.","Israel thlahai ruok chu Solomon chun chuong ang siehlawa chun a siem ve nawh a, indo mihai, a lusa- hai, a mi lienhai, a sipai hotuhai, a tawlailîr le a sakawr chung chuong mi hotuhai an ni lem a."
23,"These were the chief officers that were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.","Chuonghai chu Solomona sin- thaw chunga hotu bîk, za nga le sâwm- nga, sinthaw vêngtuhai chu an nih."
24,But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.,"Pharao naunu ruok chu David khawpuia inthawk chu ama in, Solomonin a bâwlpêka chun a hang fe tah a; chuongchun, Millo chu a bâwl tah a."
25,"And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto Jehovah, burning incense therewith, upon the altar that was before Jehovah. So he finished the house.","Chun, Solomon chun LALPA ta dinga maichâm a siema chun kum tin vawi thum pumrawhmang thilinhlân le, inremna thil inhlân ân hlân hlak a, LALPA hmaah maichâma chun riminhnikhai a raw sa bawk hlak a. Chuongchun, in chu a zo fel tah a."
26,"And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.","Chun, lal Solomon chun Edom rama Tuipui Sen panga Eloth bula um Ezion-geber hmuna chun lawng ruol a siem a."
27,"And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.","Chun, Hiram chun a siehlaw lawng mihai, tuisuorieta châng ṭhang, lawnga Solomon siehlawhai fepui dingin a tir a."
28,"And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.","Chuonghai chu Ophira chun an va feh a, chutaka mi chu rângkachak talent za li le sâwmhni an hung phur a, lal Solomon kuoma chun an hung intlun a."
