1,"And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.","Chun, Solomon chun Aigupta lal Pharao le inkungkeina a siem a, Pharao naunu a nei a, ama in le LALPA in a bâwl hma le, Jerusalem khuo kula ân huol vêl hmakhat chun David khawpuia chun ân umtir a."
2,"Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.","Mipuihai chu bâwlhmunahai an inthâwi el hlak a, chu hma chun LALPA hming ta dinga in bâwl a la um hri naw leiin."
3,"And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.","Solomon chun LALPA chu a hmangai a, a pa David thuruothai chu a zâwm hlak a, bâwlhmunahai ân thâwi a, rim inhnikhai a raw el hlaka chu."
4,And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.,"Chun, lal chu inthâwi dingin Gibeon khuoah a feh a, chu chu bâwl- hmun ropuitak a ni sih a; Solomon chun chu maichâm chunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân sâng khat zet ân hlân a."
5,"In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.","Chun, Gibeon khuoa chun zânah LALPA chu Solomon kuomah a mangah a hung inlâr a; chun, Pa- thienin, “Hni ta, ieng am a na ka pêk ding che?” a ta."
6,"And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.","Solomon chun, “I siehlaw ka pa David kha i mithmua thutak le, felnaa leh, lungril indiktak puta a um ang pei khan nang chun a kuomah lunginsietna nasatak în langtir a, nangin hi lunginsietna nasatak hi a ta dingin i vopêk a, nangin a lal- ṭhungphaa ṭhung ding naupa i pêk a, vawisûna a hung um ta ang ngei hin."
7,"And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.","Chuongchun, aw LALPA ka Pathien, nang chun i siehlaw hi ka pa David aia chun lalah i lo siem tah a; kei chu chu naupangsie el ka la na, thu hung tieng le fe tieng khawm hi ka la hriet nawh a,"
8,"And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.","I siehlaw hi i mihai i thlanghai, mi tamtak, an tam leia tiem sêng ruollo le, a zât hriet sêng ruol lohai lai hin a um a na."
9,"Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great people?","Chuongchun, i mihai rorêlpêkna dingin i siehlaw hi hrietna lungril hung pe la, a sie le a ṭha ka thlier theina dingin, i mi hieng zât zozai hi tuin am ro rêlpêk thei a ta le?” a ta."
10,"And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.","Chun, Solomonin chu thil chu a hni leiin, chu thuhril chun LALPA a suklâwm hleh a."
11,"And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice;","Chun, Pathien chun a kuomah, “Nangin i ta dinga dam sâwtna hni lo a, hieng ang hi i hni lem leiin le, i ta dinga hausakna khawm hni lo a, i hmêlmahai thina ding khawm hni lo a, i ta dinga rorêl thiemna i hni leiin, ngai ta, i hni ang chun ka thaw tah a;"
12,"behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.","ngai ta, varna le hrietna lungril ka pêk che a nih; chuongchun, i hmaah nangma ang hrim hrim tu- khawm an um nawh a, i hnunga khawm nanga ang hrim hrim chu tukhawm hung um ta naw bawk an tih."
13,"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days.","Chun, i hni naw hausakna le ropuina khawm ka pêk bawk che; Chuongchun, i dam sûngin lalhai lai chun nanga ang hrim hrim um naw ni hai."
14,"And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.","I pa Davidin a hraw anga, ka thuruothai le ka thupêkhai pawm dinga ka lampuihai i hraw chun in- dam sâwttir bawk ka ti che,” a ta."
15,"And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.","Chun, Solomon chu a hang har a, ngai ta, mang a lo ni zing el a; chun, Jerusalemah a feh a, LALPA thu- thlung bâwm hmaah a ngîr a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân le inremna thilinhlân ân hlân a; a siehlaw po pohai ta dingin ruoi a ṭheh a."
16,"Then there came two women that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.","Nuhmei pahni nawchizawr, lal kuoma chun an hung a, ama hmaah an hang ngîr a."
17,"And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.","Chun, nuhmei pakhat chun, “Aw ka lalpa, hi nuhmei le hin in khata um ve ve kan na, chu ina a um ve lai chun nau ka nei a."
18,"And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.","Chun, ka nau nei ni thum hnunga chun hi nuhmei khawm hin a nei veh a; um hmunkhat kan na, chu ina um keini pahni chau naw chu, chu ina chun tukhawm mikhuol um an um nawh a."
19,"And this woman’s child died in the night, because she lay upon it.","Chun, hi nuhmei nau hi zânah a lo thih a; a delhlum a nih."
20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.","Chuongchun, zân lai chun a tho a, i suoknu hi a in kârin ka naupa ka kuoma um chu a lâk a, a pawm a, a nau thi chu a mîn pawmtir a."
21,"And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.","A zînga zîngkâra ka nau nêne pe dinga ka hang tho chun a thi a lo ni zing el a, nisienkhawm, zîngkâra ka hang en chieng chun, ngai ta, ka naupa, ka inei kha a lo ni ta dêr da el a,” a ta."
22,"And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.","Nuhmei dang chun, “Ni lo, a dam lem hi ka naupa a na, a thi hi i naupa a nih,” a ti veh a. Pakhat chun, “Ni lo, a thi hi i naupa a na, a dam hi keia naupa a nih,” a lo ti tlat bawk a. Chuong ang chun lal hmaa chun an hril ve ve a."
23,"Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.","Chuongchun, lal chun, “Pakhat- in, ‘A dam lem hi ka naupa a na, a thi hi i naupa a nih,’ a tih a, chun, pa- khatin, ‘Ni lo, a thi hi i naupa a na, a dam hi ka naupa a nih,’ a ti bawk sih a,” a ta."
24,"And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.","Chun, lal chun, “Kâwlhnâm mi hung lapêk ta u,” a ta. Chuongchun, kâwlhnâm chu lal hmaa chun an hung lâk a."
25,"And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.","Chun, lal chun, “Nautê a dam kha tum hni insuo unla, a chenve chu pakhat kha pe unla, a chenve chu pakhat kha pe ro,” a ta."
26,"Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.","Chuongchun, nautê dam lem a nu chun nautê chu a lainat êm êm el sih a; lal kuoma chun, “Aw ka lalpa, nautê dam hi ama kha pe el rawh, a that chu that lul naw raw khai,” a ta. Pakhat lem chun, “Chang bîk naw tawp ka tih, nang khawma chang bîk naw bawk i tih, tanbawng el ro,” a ta."
27,"Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.","Chuongchun, lal chun a dawn a, “Nautê dam kha a hmasanu kha pe ro, that dêr naw ro, ama ngei kha a nu a ni kha,” a ta."
28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.","Chun, Israelhai po po chun chu thua lal rorêl dân chu an lo hriet a; lal chu an ṭi ta hle el a; rorêlna dinga Pathien varna amaa chun a um ti an hriet ta sih a."
