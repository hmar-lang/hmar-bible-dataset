1,At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.,Chuong lai chun Jeroboam naupa Abija chu a damnawh a.
2,"And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spake concerning me that I should be king over this people.","Chun, Jeroboam chun a nuhmei kuomah, “Tho la, Jeroboam nuhmei a nih ti an hriet nawna ding chein insukdanglam la, Silo-ah va fe ta khai; ngai ta, chutaka chun zâwlnei Ahija, hieng mihai chunga lala ka la um dingzie, ka chungchâng thu hriltu kha a um ie."
3,"And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child.","Beiphêk sâwm le, bei tlang chitê tê, khuoizu bûr khat leh chawi la, a kuomah va fe ta, naupang um dân ding chu lo hril a ti che,” a ta."
4,"And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.","Chun, Jeroboam nuhmei chun chuong ang chun a thawh a, a tho a, Silo-a chun a feh a, Ahija ina chun a va fe tah a, Ahija chun khuo khawm a hmu thei ta nawh a, a upat leiin a mit ân thim sih a."
5,"And Jehovah said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.","Chun, LALPAIN Ahija kuomah, “Ngai ta, Jeroboam nuhmei a naupa chungchâng thua râwn ding chein a hung a; a damnaw a na, hieng ang hin lo hril rawh; hieng ang hi nîng a ta, a hung lût pha chun, nuhmei dang ni âwmtakin a hung insiem ding a nih,” a ta."
6,"And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.","Chun, Ahija chun chuonga kawt- khâra a hung lût laia a ke sir ri a hei hriet phing chun, “Nang Jeroboam nuhmei, hung lût raw khai, iengtiziea mi danga insiem am i nih a? Chanchin ṭha nawtak hril ding chea hril ka nih i sawnnaw."
7,"Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,","Fe nâwk ta la, Jeroboam kuom- ah, ‘LALPA Israelhai Pathienin hieng ang hin a tih, Mipuihaia inthawk hin ka dawmsâng cheh a, ka mi Israelhai chunga hin hotuah ka siem cheh a,"
8,"and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes,","David sûnghai ram ka lâkpêk a, chu chu ka pêk cheh a; nisienla- khawm, nang chu ka siehlaw David angin i um ve nawh a; ama chun chu ka thupêkhai a pawm a, ka mithmua thilṭha chau thaw tumin a lungril po poin a mi zui hlak a;"
9,"but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:","nang ruok chun chu i hmaa mihai po po nêkin thil i suksuol nasa bîk a, mi suklunginsenna dingin pathien danghai le milim sunghai i siem a, hnung i mîn nghatsan tah a,"
10,"therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone.","chuleiin, ngai ta, Jeroboam sûng- kuo chunga hin thil ṭha naw hung intlungtir ka ta. Jeroboama inthawk hin naupasal taphawt chu Israel rama mi khuokhira um le, khuokhir naw khawm sukbohmang ka ta, miin êk a phît fai rêt ang hin Jeroboam sûngkuo hi a mang dêr hmakhat chun ka phît fai rêt ding a nih."
11,Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah hath spoken it.,"Jeroboam sûngkuo laia mi, khawpuia thi taphawthai chu uiin fâng an ta; rama thi taphawthai chu chunglêng vatehaiin fâng an tih; chu chu LALPAIN a hril tah a nih,’ ti rawh."
12,"Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.","Chuongchun, tho la, i in tieng fe nâwk el rawh, khawpui sûng i sir phingleh naupang chu a thi ding a nih."
13,"And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.","Chuongchun, Israelhai po po chun sûn an ta, vui an tih; Jeroboam sûngkuo lai chun ama chau chu thlâna sie ding a ni ding a ni sih a; Jeroboam sûngkuo lai hin ama chaua hin LALPA Israelhai Pathien chunga ṭhatna ieng amanih ân lang leiin."
14,"Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.","Chun, LALPAIN tu ela Jero- boam sûngkuo hung sukbohmangtu ding Israelhai chunga lal siem a ta; tuta inthawk ngei hin."
15,"For Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger.","LALPA chun tuia phairuong kûng inhnîng inhnîng angin Israelhai chu hung vaw hnîng a ta; chuong- chun, LALPA lung suksena an Aserahai chu an siem leiin, an puhai a lo pêk tah, hi ram ṭhataka inthawk hin Israelhai chu la keidawk fai vawng a ta, vadung khêl tienga chun la sukdar vawng a tih."
16,"And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin.","Chun, Israelhai chu thil insuk- suoltira a thaw Jeroboam suolnahai leiin Israelhai chu nghatsan a tih,” a ta."
17,"And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.","Chun, Jeroboam nuhmei chu a tho a, a suok tah a, Tirza khuo chu a va tlung a, chun, in kawtkhâr bul a va tlung phingle chun naupang chu a thi tah a."
18,"And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the prophet.","Chun, LALPAIN a siehlaw zâwlnei Ahija hmanga thu a lo hril ta ang ngei khan Israelhai po po chun an sûn a, an vui tah a."
19,"And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.","Jeroboam chanchin dang, a râl do thu le a rorêl thu chu, ngai ta, Israelhai lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a."
20,"And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Jeroboam rorêl sûng chu kum sâwmhni le kum hni a na; chun, a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, a naupa Nadab chu a aiawin ân lal tah a."
21,"And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.","Chun, Solomon naupa Reho- boam chu Judai ramah ân lal a. An lal tîr lai chun Rehoboam chu kum sâwmli le kum khat mi a na, LALPA- IN a hming inumtirna dinga Israel hnam po pohai laia a thlang khawpui Jerusalema chun kum sâwm le kum sari ân lal a; a nu hming chu Naama, Ammon mi a nih."
22,"And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.",Judahai chun LALPA mit- hmua chun thil suol an thawh a; an puhai thilthaw po po khûma an suolnahai chun a thîkthu a chawktho pêk a.
23,"For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree;","Tlâng insâng tina le thing hring tin hmuna hin lungphunhai phunin bâwlhmunhai le Aserahai chenin an siem bawk sih a,"
24,and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Jehovah drove out before the children of Israel.,"chu rama chun pasal mâni inzawrhai khawm an um a, Israel thlahai hmaah LALPAIN a hnawt- suok tah hnamhai thilthaw tir- dakum tinrêng ang chu an thaw veh a."
25,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;","Chun, lal Rehoboam inlal kum nga kum chun Aigupta ram lal Sisak chun Jerusalem khuo chu a hang rûn a."
26,"and he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.","LALPA ina rohai le lal rohai chu a lâk a, a rêng el chun a lâk fai vawng a; Solomon rângkachak phaw siem po po khawm kha a lâksa vawng a."
27,"And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.","Chun, lal Rehoboam chun chuong aia chun dâr phawhai a siem a, lal in kawtkhâr vêngtu hotuhai ân kawltir a."
28,"And it was so, that, as oft as the king went into the house of Jehovah, the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.","Chun, lal chu LALPA ina a lût po leh vêngtuhai chun an chawi a; chun, vêngtuhai pindana chun an sie nâwk pei hlak a."
29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?",Rehoboam chanchin le a thil- thaw danghai po po chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?
30,And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.,"Chun, Jeroboam le Rehoboam chu indo zing zingin an um hlak a."
31,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Rehoboam chu a puhai kuomah a in tah a, David khawpuia a puhai kuoma chun an phûm tah a; a nu hming chu Naama, Ammon mi a nih. Chun, a naupa Abijam chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
