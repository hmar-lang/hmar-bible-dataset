1,"And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.","Solomon chun ama in chu kum sâwm le kum thum a bâwl a, a in chu a zo vawng a."
2,"For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.","Lebanon Rampui In sidar ban tlar li, ban chunga sidar thingphêk chunga chun a bâwl bawk a; a dung- tieng chu tawng za a na, a khangtieng chu tawng sâwmnga a na, ân sâng- tieng chu tawng sâwmthum a nih."
3,"And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row.","Chun, banhai sâwmli panga chunga innghat pindanhai chunga chun sidar thingphêkhaia inkhum a na, banhai chu tlar khata chun sâwm le panga pei a nih."
4,"And there were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.","Tlar thumin tukver a um a, var le varhai chu ân ep vawng a."
5,And all the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.,"Kawtkhârhai le banhai po po chu thingphêkin kil li neia siem a na, var le varhai chu tlar thumin ân ep vawng a."
6,"And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.","Chun, tuolpûk chu ban neiin a siem a, a dungtieng chu tawng sâwm- nga a na, a khangtieng chu tawng sâwmthum a na; chun, chuong hmaa- hai chun tuolpûk a siem a, banhai le a hmaa lûtna kailâwnhai leh."
7,"And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.","Chun, a rorêlna ding lalṭhung- pha tuolpûk, rorêlna tuolpûk chu a siem bawk a, chu chu ṭuong khing- tienga inthawka khingtieng chena sidar thinga inkhum a nih."
8,"And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like unto this porch.","Chun, a umna dingin tuolpûk sûng, huon sûng tuollai danga um chu chuong ang bawk chun siem a na. Chun, Pharao naunu (Solomonin nu- hmeia a inei) chu tuolpûk ang bawk chun a in a bâwlpêk a."
9,"All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.","Chuong po po chu lung man tamtak tak, a huntâwk ang chiea sut, âtnaa âta bâwl a na, a sûngtieng khawm, a puotieng khawm, lung- phûma inthawka a lêr chenin; chun, chuong ang bawkin tuol tieng chun inhuon sûng tuolzâwl khawlai lientak chenin."
10,"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.","Chun, lungphûmhai chu lung man tamtak tak, lung lientak tak tawng sâwm dâm, tawng riet dâma rem a nih."
11,"And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.","Chun, chu chung tieng chu lung man tamtak tak, lung a huntâwk ang chiea sut le sidar thing a na."
12,"And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.","A vêlin inhuon sûng tuolzâwl lientak chu lung sut sâwmthum le Sidar thingphêk thuo khata inhuon a na; LALPA in inhuon sûng tuollai sûngril lem leh, in tuolpûk ang bawk khan."
13,And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.,"Chun, lal Solomon chun mi a tir a, Tura khuoa inthawk chun Hiram a ko a."
14,"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.","Ama chu Naphtali hnam hmeithai nau a na, a pa chu Tura khuoa mi dâr suttu a na, ama dâr sut kawnga hrim hrim chun a varin a hrietthiemin a themthiem hle el a. Lal Solomon kuoma chun a feh a, a sin po po chu a thawpêk vawng a."
15,"For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.","Dâr ban pahni a sûng kaw- rawngin, tawng sâwm pariet ve vea insângin a siem a, a lienzie chu tawng sâwmpahni ve ve le inchi li ve vea saa inkuol a nih."
16,"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.","Ban sîpa sie dingin dâr sung bâwk pahni a siem a, bâwk pakhat insâng tieng chu tawng nga a na, bâwk pakhat insâng tieng khawm chu tawng nga bawk a nih."
17,"There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.","Ban sîpa bâwkhaia chun ṭiel chikchek le, inher chîlchielhai hi a um a, bâwk pakhata chun pasari a na, pakhat danga khawm chun pasari bawk."
18,"So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.","Chuongchun, banhai chu a siem a, chuong ban sîpa a bâwkhai tuomna ding chun ṭiel chikchek theibufaihai leh pakhat chunga chun a vêlin tlar hni a um a; chuong ang bawk chun bâwk pakhat chunga khawm chun ân umtir a."
19,"And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.","Chun, tuolpûka ban sîphaia bâwka chun lili lim hi a chuong a, tawng li a nih."
20,"And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.","Chun, ban pahni sîpa bâwkhaia chun a reia ṭiel chikchek bul ela chun theibufaihai lim a um bawk a; chun, theibufaihai chu chuong bâwkhaia chun za hni ve vea intlarin a um a."
21,"And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.","Chun, biek in tuolpûkhaia chun banhai chu ân ngîrtir a, changtieng ban chu ân ngîr a, a hminga chun Jakin ân bûk a, chun, vawitieng ban chu ân ngîr a, a hminga chun Boaz ân bûk a."
22,And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.,"Chun, ban sîpa chun lili lim a chuong a; chuongchun, ban tieng sin chu zo a ni tah a."
23,"And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.","Chun, dâr tuizêng, a reia in- thawka a rei khingtieng chena tawng sâwm tla, ân sâng tieng tawng nga a sung a; a rei chu tawng sâwmthum biel vêl a nih."
24,"And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.","A rei hnuoia chun kumûm lim hin a vêlsuok a, tawng sâwm a na, tuizêng rei vêla chun a um a; chuong kumûmhai chu tlar hniin an um a; sung sa nghâl an nih."
25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.","Chu chu bâwngchal sâwm le pahni chungah ân nghat a, pathumin hmartieng an nghah a, pathumin thlangtieng an nghah a, pathumin simtieng an nghah a, pathumin saktieng an nghah a. Chun, zêng chu an chungah ân ṭhut a, an mei tieng chun sûng tieng chu a ngha seng a;"
26,"And it was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.","kutpha bawka sa a nih; a rei chu lili pâr ang, no rei anga siem a na, bath sâng hni keng a nih."
27,"And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.","Chun, inṭhutna sâwm dârin a siem a, inṭhutna pakhat seizie chu tawng li a na, a khangtieng chu tawng li bawk a na, ân sâng tieng chu tawng thum a nih."
28,And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;,"Chun, inṭhutnahai siem dân chu hieng ang hi a nih: chuonghai chun khur a nei a, a khurhai chu a reihai inkâra chun a um a;"
29,"and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.","chun, a reihai inkâra khurhaia chun sakeibakneihai, bâwngchalhai, cherubhai a chuong a; a rei chunga chun innghatna a um a; chun, sakeibakneihai le bâwngchal hnuoia chun cheimawinahai a um nghien a."
30,"And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each.","Chun, inṭhutnahaia chun dâr tawlailîr pali le dâr kalru a um seng a, a kihai palia chun ân nghatna a um seng a, insâwpna bêl hnuoi tieng chun ân nghatna sunga sung a um a, a rei senga chun cheimawina a um seng a."
31,"And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.","Chun, a suonkuol bau rei chu tawng khat tla a na, a rei tlâng chu suonkuol anga chêng a na, tawng khat le a chenve a nih, chun, a rei tlânghai chu cheimawi a na, a khur- hai chu kil li a na, a chêng nawh a."
32,And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.,"Chun, tawlailîr palihai chu a khur hnuoi tiengahai chun a um a; chun, tawlailîr kalruhai chu inṭhut- naahai chun a um a, tawlailîr insâng tieng chu tawng khat le a chenve a nih."
33,"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.","Chu tawlailîrhai siem dân chu sakawr tawlailîr ke siem dân ang hi a na, a tlungzamhai, a suonkuolhai, a sunkalnahai, a laibâwkhai chu sung vawng a nih."
34,And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself.,"Chun, inṭhutna kil li senga chun innghatna pali a um a, chuong innghatnahai chu inṭhutna le chun pumkhat vawng an nih."
35,And in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same.,"Chun, inṭhutna chunga chun suonkuol, tawng chenvea insâng hi a um a, inṭhutna chunga ân ṭhutna kalhai le a khurhai chu pumkhat vawng an nih."
36,"And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the panels thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.","Chun, ân ṭhutna kephêkahai le, a khurahai chun a lienzie ang peiin cherubhai, sakeibakneihai, intûm thinghai ân chuongtir a, a vêl chun cheimawina hi a um seng a."
37,"After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.","Chuong ang vawng chun in- ṭhutna sâwmhai chu a siem a, a rêng chun pakhata sung an ni vawng a, intie seng, siem dân inang vawng an nih."
38,And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.,"Chun, insâwpna bêl sâwm dârin a siem a, maihûn pakhat chun bath sâwmli a dawng a; maihûn chu tawng li seng a na, inṭhutna sâwm chunga chun maihûn pakhat chu ân ṭhut pei a."
39,"And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.","Chun, inṭhutnahai chu in changtieng chun panga ân ṭhut a, vawitieng panga chun panga, chun, tuizêng chu in changtieng panga saktienga sim nghain ân ṭhut a."
40,"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:","Chun, Hiram chun insâwpna bêlhai, vutluohai, maihûnhai a siem a."
41,"the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;","Chuongchun, Hiram chun LALPA in ta dinga Solomon a siem- pêk po po chu a zo vawng ta a; ban pahni dâm, ban sîpa bêl anga inbâwkhai pahni, ban sîpa bêl anga inbâwk tuomna ṭiel chikchekhai pahni,"
42,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;","chu tuomna ṭiel chikchek ta dinga theibufai za lihai dâm, ban sîpa bêl anga inbâwk pahni tuomna dinga ṭiel chikchek ve ve ta dinga theibufai tlar hnihai kha;"
43,"and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;","chun, inṭhutna sâwm le inṭhut- na chunga insâwpna bêl sâwmhai dâm,"
44,"and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;","tuizêng pakhat le tuizêng hnuoia sebâwngchal sâwm le pahni- hai dâm,"
45,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Jehovah, were of burnished brass.","bêlhai, vutluohai le maihûnhai le dâm, chuong bûr le bêlhai po po Hiramin LALPA in dinga Solomon a siempêkhai chu dâr nâwt tlêt ruok a nih."
46,"In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.","Jordan phaizâwlah, Sukkoth le Zarethan inkâra bepil hmunah a nih lalpa chun a sung chu."
47,"And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.","Chun, Solomonin chuong, bûr le bêlhai po po chu a tam êm leiin bûk suok loin a sie el a, dâr bûk zât chu hriet suok ruol a ni nawh."
48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;","Chun, Solomon chun LALPA ina bûr le bêl um po pohai chu a siem a, rângkachak maichâm le entirna bei siena dawkân chu rângkachakin;"
49,"and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;","chun, hmun inthieng hma zâwna khâwnvar siena changtienga panga le vawitienga panga chu râng- kachak inthiengin; pârhai le, khâwn- varhai le chaichehai chu rângkachak bawkin;"
50,"and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple, of gold.","nohai, khâwnvar puon chepna- hai, maihûnhai, haihawhai, rimin- hnik thlêng, meilâknahai, rângka- chak hlîr hlak vawngin; in sûngril lem, hmun inthiengtak kawtkhâra- hai le, in (biek in chu) kawtkhâr inbûknahai chu rângkachakin."
51,"Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun LALPA in dinga a siem po po chu a zo ta vawng a. Chuongchun, Solomon chun a pa David lo inhlân sa tah tangkaruohai, rângkachak dâm, bûr le bêlhai chu a lâklût a, LALPA ina rohai lai chun a sie tah a."
