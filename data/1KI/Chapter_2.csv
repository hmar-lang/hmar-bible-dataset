1,"Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,","David thi hun chu a hung hnai tah a, a naupa Solomon chu thu a pêk a,"
2,"I am going the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;","“Leihnuoi po po dân angin ka fe ve ding a ni tah a, chuongchun, hrât- takin um la, patlingtakin um rawh,"
3,"and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself;","i thilthaw taphawta le i nghatna tieng poa i tluongtlung theina dingin Mosie Dân ziek anga, LALPA i Pathienin a lampuihai hraw ding le, a thuruot dâm, a thupêk dâm, a rorêl- hai dâm le, a thuinhriettir pawm dinga a pêkhai hi zâwm rawh;"
4,"that Jehovah may establish his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.","LALPAIN ka chungchâng thua, ‘I thlahaiin an lungril tak le, an lungvar taka ka mithmua thutaka um dinga an umdân an fîmkhur chun Israelhai lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ding tlasam naw ti ni,’ tiha a hril kha a sukdet ding a nih."
5,"Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.","Chun, Zeruia naupa Joab mi thawzie, Israelhai sipai hotu pahni Nera naupa Abner le Jether naupa Amasa hai a thawzie ngei kha i hriet a. Khânga a that a, inrem laia indo lai thisen insuoin ân suoh a, a kâwnga a kâwngkhi le a kekawk buna indona thisen a sukkaizie hai kha."
6,"Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.","Chuongchun, i rem hriet dân angin thaw la, a lua kêlsam ṭo hi thlânah lungmuongtakin inliemtir naw rawh."
7,"But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.","Gilead mi Barzillai nauhai chunga ruok chun lunginsietna in- langtir la, i dawkâna thlaithlêng awttuah inṭhangtir ve rawh; i unau Absalom leia ka tlân hmang lai khan ka kuomah an hung sih a."
8,"And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.","Chun, Bahurim khuoa mi Benjamin thla, Gera naupa Simei hi i kuomah a um a, ama chun Mahanaim hmuna ka fe lai khan ṭawngsie ṭha nawtak a mîn phur a; amiruokchu, Jordana khan mi tuok dingin a hung thlah a, chutaka chun ‘Kâwlhnâm- in that naw ning che,’ tiin LALPA hming sâlin ṭawng ka lo inkhâm tah a."
9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.","Chuongchun, thiemchang chun chu insuo naw rawh, mi var i ni sih a, a chunga ieng anga thaw ding am a na ti hre el i tih; a lua kêlsam ṭo chu thisen leh thlânah în liemtir ding a nih,” a ta."
10,"And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.","Chun, David chu a puhai kuoma chun a in innghil ve tah a, David khawpuia chun an phûm a."
11,"And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.","Israelhai chunga David inlal sûng chu kum sâwmli a na, Hebron khuoah kum sari ân lal a, Jerusalem khuoah kum sâwmthum le kum thum ân lal."
12,And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.,"Chun, Solomon chu a pa David lalṭhungphaa chun a ṭhung a, chuongchun, a ram chu nasataka suknghetin a hung um tah a."
13,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.","Chun, Haggith naupa Adonija chu Bathseba Solomon nu kuomah a feh a, ama chun, “Ṭha tieng thua hung am i nih?” a lo tih a."
14,"He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.","Chun, ama chun, “Ṭha tieng thuah nih e,” a ta. Chun, “I kuomah ieng am a nih hril ding ka nei a,” a ti nâwk a. Ama chun, “Hril ta la,” a ta."
15,"And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from Jehovah.","Chun, ama chun, “Ram hi ka ta a ni tah ti le, Israelhai po po khawm hin keima hi lal dingin an mi thlîr zing a nih ti i hriet a, amiruokchu, ram chu ka unaupa ta dingin a hung inlet ta lem a; LALPA lo ruot dânah a ta a ni hrim a nih."
16,"And now I ask one petition of thee; deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.","Tuhin thil pakhat hni ding che ka nei a, mi remti nawpêk naw hrâm rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuom- ah, “Hril ta la,” a ta."
17,"And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka hni che a nih, lal Solomon kuoma chun hril la, (i thu chu a sêl âwm si nawh a) Sunam mi Abisag hi nuhmeiah mîn neitir raw se,” a ta."
18,"And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.","Chun, Bathseba chun, “Aw le, lal chu lo bepêk ka ti che,” a ta."
19,"Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.","Chuongchun, Bathseba chu Adonija va bepêk dingin lal Solomon kuoma chun a fe tah a. Chun, lal chu ama lo lâwm dingin a tho a, a hmaa chun a kûn a, a lalṭhungphaa chun a ṭhung a, chun, lal nu ta ding chun ṭhungpha ân sietir a; a changtienga chun a ṭhung tah a."
20,"Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.","Chuongchun, “Thil pakhat chi- terek ka hni ding che a nih, mi remti nawpêk naw hrâm rawh,” a ta. Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Hni ta la, nu, remti nawpêk naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta."
21,"And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.","Chun, ama chun, “Sunam mi Abisag hi i unaupa Adonija nuhmeiah inneitir rawh,” a ta."
22,"And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.","Chun, lal Solomon chun a dawn a, a nu kuoma chun, “Iengtiziea Sunam mi Abisag hi Adonija ta dinga hni am i ni leh? Ram khawm hi hnipêk law law ta la; ama chu ka u a nih an- nâwm, ama ta ding le thiempu Abia- thar ta ding le Zeruia naupa Joab ta ding khawma hni raw chu,” a ta."
23,"Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.","Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun, “LALPA hming sâlin, Adonija thil hni hin ama chunga thina thuhril a ni naw tâkleh, Pathienin a law law mi law el sienla, chu nêka nasa khawm a."
24,"Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.","Chuongchun, LALPA a thutiem anga mi sukdet a, ka pa lal David lalṭhungphaa mîn ṭhungtir a, sung- kuo mi lo inngîrpêktu hringna sâlin ka hril hi, Adonija hi vawisûn le le hin sukhlum nghâl ding a nih,” a tih a; ṭawng ân khâm tah a."
25,"And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.","Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu a tir a, ama chu a va thawh a, a thi tah a."
26,"And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.","Chun, thiempu Abiathar kuoma chun lal chun, “Anathoth khuoa nanga in le loah fe dai rawh, thi tlâk chu i ni ngei a, amiruokchu, ka pa David hmaa LALPA Pathien bâwm i lo zâwn hlak lei le, ka pa rinum tuornahai po poa chun i lo tuor ve ta hlak leiin tuhin chu chu la sukhlum hri naw ning che,” a ta."
27,"So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Abiathar chu LALPA thiempu a nina chu a bân tah a; LALPAIN Silo khuoa Eli sûnghai chungchâng thu a hril kha ân tlungtir theina dingin."
28,"And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.","Chun, chu thu chu Joab chun a lo hriet a, Joab chu Absalom tieng khan a ṭhang naw a chu, Adonija tienga ṭhang a ni sih a. Chuong- chun, Joab chu LALPA Puon inah a tlân a, maichâm kihai chu a va chel tah a."
29,"And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.","Chun, “LALPA puon inah Joab a tlân a, ngai ta, maichâm bulah a um,” tiin lal Solomon chu an hril a. Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu, “Hang thaw rawh,” tiin a tir a."
30,"And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.","Benaia chu, LALPA puon ina chun a hang feh a, a kuoma chun, “Lalin, ‘Hung thla raw se’, a tih” a ta. Ama chun, “Ni lo e, hitaka hin thi el lem ka tih,” a ta. Benaia chun, “Joab chun hieng ang hin a lo tih a, hieng ang hin a mi lo dawn a nih,” tiin lal kuomah thu ân tlun nâwk a."
31,"And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “A hril ang chun hang thaw la, phûm rawh, a san um dêr loa Joabin thisen ân suoa inthawka kha kei le ka pa sûnghai chu i sukfihlîm theina ding- in."
32,"And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.","Chuongchun, ama nêka mi ṭha lem le mi fel lem pahni Nera naupa Abner, Israelhai sipai hotu le, Jether naupa Amasa, Judahai sipai hotu kha ka pa David hriet loa a thawh a, kâwlhnâma a that leiin LALPAIN a thisen chu ama lu chung ngeiah hung inlêttir a tih."
33,"So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.","Chuongchun, an thisen chu Joab lu chung le a thlahai lu chungah kumkhuoin lêt a ta, David chunga dâm, a thlahai chunga dâm, a sûng- hai chunga dâm, a lalṭhungpha chunga dâm ruok chun LALPA kuoma inthawka lungmuongna kum- khuoin um zing lem a tih,” a ta."
34,"Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.","Chuongchun, Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu a hang feh a, a hang thawh a, a that tah a; chun, thlalêra ama ina chun an phûm tah a."
35,And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.,"Chun, lalin Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu sipaihai chungah a ai ân awtir a, chun, thiempu Zadok chu lalin Abiathar ai ân awtir a."
36,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.","Chun, lalin Simei chu ân kotir a, a kuomah, “Jerusalema hin in bâwl la, chutaka chun um la, chutaka inthawk chun khâwlai dang khawm suok naw rawh."
37,"For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.","I suok ni, Kidron vadung i kân ni le le chun i thi ngei ding a nih ti hre raw khai, chun, i thisen chu nangma lu chunga ngei um a tih,” a ta."
38,"And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.","Simei chun lal kuomah, “An dik ie, lal ka puin a hril ang chun i siehlaw hin thaw pei a tih,” a ta. Chun, Simei chu Jerusalema chun sâwtrei chu a um a."
39,"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.","Chun, kum thum ân vawi hnung chun Simei siehlawhai pahni chu Gath khaw lal Maaka naupa Akis kuomah an zâm a. Chun, “Ngai ta, i siehlawhai chu Gath khuoah an um,” tiin Simei chu an hril a."
40,"And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.","Simei chu a tho a, a sabengtung chu a buotsai a, siehlawhai zawng dingin Gath khuoa Akis kuoma chun a fe tah a; chun, Simei chun Gath khuoa inthawk chun a siehlawhai chu a va ṭhuoi tah a."
41,"And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.","Chun, Simei chu Gath khuoah a va feh a, Jerusalemah a hung nâwk tah, ti Solomon chu an hril a."
42,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest unto thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The saying that I have heard is good.","Chun, lal chun Simei chu ân kotir a, a kuomah, “ ‘I suok ni, ram danga i suok ni le lein i thi ngei ding a nih,’ ti khan LALPA hming sâlin ṭawng kân khâmtir chein, kân hriet- tir che a ni naw am a nih? chun, nang khawma ka kuomah, ‘I thu hril ka hriet hi a ṭha ie,’ i ti kha."
43,"Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?",Iengdinga LALPA ṭawng in- khâm le thu ka pêk che kha hlen lo am i nih a?” a ta.
44,"The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head.","Chun, lal ma chun Simei kuom- ah, “I lungril sûng rîtlozie, ka pa David chunga i thawziehai kha i hriet vawng a, chuongchun, LALPAIN i rîtlona hi nangma lu chunga ngei hung inlêttir a tih."
45,"But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.","Lal Solomon ruok chu mal- sâwmin um a ta, David lalṭhungpha chu LALPA hmaah kumkhuoa sukdet ning a tih,” a ta."
46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.","Chuongchun, lal chun Jehoiada naupa Benaia chu thu a pêk a, ama chu a va thawh a, a that tah a. Chuongchun, ram chu Solomon kuta suknghetin a um tah a."
