1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ houses of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Israel upahai le, an hnam lusahai po po dâm, Israel thlahai sûngkuo upahai chu Jerusalem khuoa lal Solomon kuoma chun David khawpui Ziona inthawkin LALPA thuthlung bâwm zâwn dingin a ko khâwm tâwl a."
2,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.","Chun, Israel mi po pohai chu Ethanim thla (thla sarinaa chun) ruoiṭhenaah lal Solomon kuoma chun an inkhâwm ṭeu tâwl a."
3,"And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.","Chun, Israel upahai po po chu an hung a, thiempuhai chun bâwm chu an zâwn a."
4,"And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.","LALPA bâwm le inbiekna puon in le, puon ina bûr le bêl inthienghai po po chu an zâwn a; chuonghai chu thiempuhai le Levi chihai chun an zâwn a."
5,"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.","Chun, lal Solomon le Israel mi pungkhâwm po po, a kuoma hung inkhâwmhai chu bâwm hmaa chun an um tâwl a; berâm le bâwngchal a tam leia tiem sêng ruol lo le a zât hriet sêng ruol lo chun an inthâwi a."
6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.","Chuongchun, thiempuhai chun LALPA thuthlung bâwm chu a umna dinga chun an lâklût a, in sûnga biekna hmun, hmun inthiengtakah, cherubhai thla hnuoia chun."
7,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.",Cherubhai chun bâwm umna chung zâwna chun an thlahai an zâr zing sih a; cherubhai chun bâwm le a zâwnfunghai chu an huop vawng a.
8,And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.,"Chun, a zâwnfunghai chu a sei khawp a, a zâwnfung hmawrhai chu biekna hmun hma, hmun inthienga inthawk chun ân hmu thei a: tuola inthawk ruok chun ân lang nawh; tu chen hin chutaka chun a la um zing a nih."
9,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.","Aigupta rama inthawka an suok a, LALPAIN Israel thlahai kuoma thu a thlung laia Mosiein Horeb tlânga lungphêk pahni a siehai chau naw kha chu, chu bâwm sûnga chun iengkhawm a um nawh."
10,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,","Chun, thiempuhai chu hmun inthienga inthawka an hung suok phingle chun LALPA in chu sûm chun a hung sip ta mup el a;"
11,so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.,"chuongchun, sûm lei chun thiempuhai chu rawngbâwlin an um thei ta naw hiel a, LALPA ropuinain LALPA in chu a suksip vawng ta sih a."
12,"Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun thu a hril tah a, “LALPAIN, ‘Inthim sa- mupa chun um ka tih,’ a ti hrim a."
13,"I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever.","I chêngna ding in, kumkhuoa i umna ding in ka bâwlpêk ta che a ni hi,” a ta."
14,"And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.","Chun, lal chu a hnungtieng chun a nghah a, Israel hung pung- khâwmhai po po chu mal a sâwm a, chuongchun, Israelhai pungkhâwm- hai po po chu an ngîr ṭhuop a."
15,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,","Chun, ama chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien, ka pa David kuom- a ama bau ngei a,"
16,"Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.","‘Aigupta rama inthawka ka mi Israelhai ka ṭhuoi suok nia inthawkin Israelhai hnam laia khâwlai khuo khawm hi ka hming umna dinga in bâwlna dingin ka la thlang ngai nawh a, amiruokchu, ka mi Israelhai hotu ding chun David hi ka thlang a nih,’ tia lo hriltu ama kut ngeia hung suk- puitlingtu hi inpâkin um raw se."
17,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Ka pa David khan Israelhai Pathien, LALPA hming ta dinga in bâwl a lungrilin a lo tum hlak a."
18,"But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN ka pa David kuoma chun, ‘I lungrila chun ka hming ta dinga in bâwl i tum hlak a, hieng ang lungril i lo put hi i thaw ṭha a;"
19,"nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.","nisienlakhawm, nang chun chu in chu bâwl naw ti nih; i naupa i ṭhalbea la suok ding chun, ka hming dingin in chu la bâwl lem a tih,’ a lo ti tah a."
20,"And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chun, LALPAIN a thuhril chu a hung sukdet tah a; LALPA lo tiem ta ang ngeiin ka pa David hmun chu ka lo hluo tain, Israel lalṭhungphaa chun ka lo ṭhung tah a; Israelhai Pathien, LALPA hming ta dingin in chu ka lo bâwl ta ngei sih a."
21,"And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.","Chutaka chun bâwm umna ding hmun chu ka lo ruot tah a, chutaka chun Aigupta rama inthawka a ṭhuoi suok laia ei puhai kuoma a lo thlung, LALPA thuthlung chu a um a,” a ta."
22,"And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;","Chun, Solomon chu LALPA maichâm hma, Israel pungkhâwmhai po po hmua chun a ngîr a, vân tieng banin a kut a phar a."
23,"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;","“Aw LALPA, Israelhai Pathien, i siehlaw an lungril po poa um ṭhahai kuoma thuthlung hlena lunginsietna suklang hlaktu, i siehlaw ka pa David kuoma thutiem hlentu, chungtieng vâna le hnuoitieng hnuoia hin nangma ang hi Pathien dang hrim hrim an um dêr nawh;"
24,"who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.","anih, nangin i bauin thu i hril a, i kutin i hung inhlawtlingtir tah a, vawisûna hung um ta ngei ang hin."
25,"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.","Chuongchun, aw LALPA Israel- hai Pathien, i siehlaw ka pa David kuomah, ‘I thlahai chu ka mithmua i um anga ka mithmua um ve dinga an um dâna an fîmkhur phawt chun ka mithmuah Israelhai lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ding tlasam naw ti nih,’ tia i lo tiem ta kha hung hlen la."
26,"Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.","Chuongchun, aw Israelhai Pathien, nangin i siehlaw ka pa David kuoma thu i lo hril ta kha lunginsiettakin hung intlungtir ngei rawh."
27,"But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded!","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chu hnuoia hin a um ngût ding am chu? Ngai ta, vân le vânhai vâna khawm i keng naw a na, hi ka in bâwla lem hin chu i vân leng naw nasa âwm ngei de!"
28,"Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day;","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA ka Pathien, vawisûna i siehlaw hin a kona che le, a ṭawngṭaina ân sam hi ngaipêkin, i siehlaw ṭawngṭaina le hnina hi hung ngaisak la;"
29,"that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.","hi hmun tieng nghaa i siehlaw hin ṭawngṭaina ân sam ding chu ngaia nangin, ‘Chutaka chun ka hming chu um a tih,’ i tina hmun ngei in tieng hin a sûn a zânin i mit în lên zing theina dingin."
30,"And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place; and when thou hearest, forgive.","Chun, i siehlaw le i mi Israelhai hin hi hmun tieng nghaa an ṭawngṭai pha chun an hninahai chu lo ngaipêk hlak la, anih, i chêngna hmun vâna inthawk chun lo ngai la; chun, lo ngaiin ngaidam la."
31,"If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before thine altar in this house;","“Mi tukhawma a vênghai chunga thil suksuolin, ṭawng in- khâmtir hiel lo ṭûl sienla, hi ina i maichâm hmaa hin hung inkhâm sienla;"
32,"then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.","nangin vâna inthawkin lo ngai la, châng la, mi suol chu ama lu chunga ngei a um dân innghata thiemnaw inchangtirin, mi fel chu a felna ang anga inhlawtir a, thiem inchangtirin i siehlawhai hi ro rêlpêk rawh."
33,"When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house:","“I mi Israelhai hin i chunga thil an suksuol leia hmêlmahai hmaa an lo tlâwm a, nanga tieng an hung ngha nâwk a, i hming an inpâk a, hi ina ṭawngṭaia thil an hung hni chun,"
34,"then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.","nangin vâna inthawkin lo ngaipêk la, i mi Israelhai suolna chu ngaidam la, an puhai ram i pêka chun ṭhuoi nâwk rawh."
35,"When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:","I chunga thil an suksuol leia, vân a ping a, ruo dâm a hung sûr naw pha chun hi hmun tieng hi nghaa an ṭawngṭai a, i hming an inpâk a, anni i sukrimsi leia an suolhai an sim chun;"
36,"then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.","nangin vâna inthawkin lo ngai la, i siehlawhai le i mi Israelhai suolna hi ngaidam la, an fena ding lampui ṭha khîkhmu pei la, chun, i mihai an rochan dinga i pêk rama hin ruo hung insûrtir bawk la."
37,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;","Kan rama hin ṭâm a hung tlah a, hri dâm a hung inlêng a, ṭâwlna amanih, hmawnna amanih, khâu- ṭhikṭhi amanih, tuktulung amanih a hung um a, an hmêlmahaiin an kawtkhâr bulhaia an hung inhuol a, hri iengkhawm, natna iengkhawm a hung tlung chun;"
38,"what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:","i mi Israelhai po po laia mâni lungrila hri uma hre a, hi in tieng hi nghaha kut hung phar taphawthaiin ṭawngṭaina le hnina an hung inhlân hrim hrim chu,"
39,"then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)","i umna vâna inthawkin lo ngai la, ngaidam la, châng la, nang an lungril hretu, mi tin an um dân ang peiin inhlawtir la, (nang chu chu, nang chau hi mihriem nauhai po po lungril hretu i ni sih a;)"
40,that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.,Kan puhai i pêk rama an um sûng po hin an ṭi theina ding chein.
41,"Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name’s sake","“I mi Israelhai ni lo hnam dang mi, nangma hming leia ram hla taka inthawka hunghai chungchâng thu khawm hi;"
42,"(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house;","(i hming ropuitak hai, i kut hrâttak hai, i bân i phar thuhai hi an la hriet tâwl ding a ni sih a;) chuong mihai chun hi in tieng nghah a, an hung ṭawngṭai pha chun;"
43,"hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.","nangin i umna vâna inthawkin lo ngai la, hnam dang mi chun a hni ang che chu lo thawpêk rawh; i mi Israelhai ang bawka khawvêla hnam tinin i hming an hriet a, an ṭi cheh a, hi ka in bâwl hin i hming a put a nih ti an hung hriet theina dingin."
44,"If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Jehovah toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name;","“I mihaiin an hmêlmahai chu i tirna tieng poa chun thaw hai sienla, i khawpui thlang tieng ngha le, i hming dinga in ka lo bâwl tieng nghah a LALPA kuoma an ṭawngṭai chun,"
45,"then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.","an ṭawngṭaina le an hnina chu nangin vâna inthawkin lo ngai la, a chungthuah hung châng rawh."
46,"If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near;","I chungah thil an suksuol a, (tukhawm thil suksuol naw an um si nawh a) an chungah i lunginsen a, hmêlma kuta i pêk a, hmêlma ram hlataka manih, hnaitaka manih khawma sala an ṭhuoi a;"
47,"yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;","sala an ṭhuoina rama an inngaituo suok a, an insîr a, ‘Thil ei lo suksuol a, indiknawtak le suoltakin ei lo thaw a ni tah,’ tia an hung ngên cheh a,"
48,"if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:","an hmêlma sala ṭhuoituhai rama an lungril tak le an lungvar taka nanga tieng an hung ngha nâwk a, an puhai i pêk ram tieng le, i khawpui i thlang tieng le i hming dinga ka in bâwl tieng nghaa i kuoma an ṭawngṭai chun;"
49,"then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause;","an ṭawngṭaina le an hnina chu nangin i umna vâna inthawkin lo ngai la, an chungthua chun châng la;"
50,"and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them","chun, i mi i chunga thil suk- suoltuhai le nanga chunga an baw- sietna kawnga an bawsietnahai po po chu ngaidam la; sala ṭhuoituhai chun anni an lunginsiet theina dingin lunginsietna inneitir la;"
51,"(for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);","i mi i rochan, Aigupta rama inthawka, thîr rawtuina sûnga in- thawka i ṭhuoisuokhai an ni sih a,"
52,"that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee.",an ko taphawt chea anni i lo ngai dinga i siehlaw hnina le i mi Israel hnina tienga i mit în lên theina dingin;
53,"For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.","Aw LALPA Pathien, kan puhai Aigupta rama inthawka i ṭhuoisuok laia i siehlaw Mosie hmanga i hril angin i rochan dingin khawvêl hnam tin laia inthawkin i suktum a ni sih a,” a ta."
54,"And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.","Chun, Solomonin LALPA kuom- a a ṭawngṭaina le hnina po po chu a hril zo chun, LALPA maichâm hmaah a dingṭhaṭhuon a, vân tieng bana kut phara a um chu a tho a."
55,"And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,","Chun, a ngîr a, râwl inringtakin Israel mi pungkhâwmhai po po chu mal a sâwmpêk a:"
56,"Blessed be Jehovah, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.","“A thutiem po po ang peia a mi Israelhai châwlna petu LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se, a siehlaw Mosie hmanga a thutiem ṭhahai po po kha pakhat khawm ân khêl nawh a."
57,"Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us;","LALPA ei Pathien chu ei puhai kuoma a um ang khan ei kuoma hin um sienla, mi mâksanin mi thlathlam naw raw se;"
58,"that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.","chuongchun, a lampuihai po po hraw ding le, ei puhai thu a lo pêk ta anga a thupêkhai, a thuruothai, a rorêlhai pawm dinga ei lungrilhai ama tienga ân nghattir theina ding- in."
59,"And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh unto Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;","Chun, a siehlaw thua le a mi Israelhai thua hin a mi zir ang peiin a châng theina dingin hieng ka thuhril, LALPA hmaa hnina kân tlunhai hi sûn le zânin ei Pathien LALPA hmaa chun châm zing raw se:"
60,"that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else.","LALPA hi Pathien a na, tu- khawm dang an um nawh ti khawvêla hnam tinin an hung hriet theina dingin."
61,"Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.","Chuongchun, a thuruot anga um ding le, a thupêkhai zâwm dingin LALPA ei Pathien tienga chun in lungrilhai ṭha famkimin um raw se; vawisûn ang zing hin,” tiin."
62,"And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah.","Chun, lal le Israelhai po po chun LALPA hmaah inthâwina an inhlân hmunkhat a."
63,"And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.","Chun, Solomonin ân hlân inremna thilinhlân dinga inthâwina bâwngchal sîng hni le sâng hni le berâm nuoi khat le sîng hni ân hlân a. Chuong ang chun lal le Israel thlahai po po chun LALPA in chu an inhlân a nih."
64,"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.","Chu ni ma chun lal chun LALPA in hma zâwna inhuon sûng tuollai chu a sukthieng a, chutaka chun LALPA hmaa dâr maichâm chu pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai, beiphit thilinhlân dâm, inremna thilinhlân sa thâu dâm siena dinga a chîn talaw leiin, pumrawhmanga thil inhlân dâm, beiphit thil inhlân dâm, inremna sa thâu thil inhlân dâm ân hlân sih a."
65,"So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.","Chuongchun, chu ṭum chun Solomon le Israelhai po po, mipui pungkhâwmhai tamtak, Hamath khaw lûtnaa inthawka Aigupta ram vadung chena mihai chu LALPA ei Pathien hmaa chun ni sari sûng rau ruoi an ṭheh a."
66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David his servant, and to Israel his people.","A ni riet ni chun mipuihai chu ân ṭintir a; chun, lal chu mal an sâwm a, chuongchun, LALPAIN a siehlaw David le a mi Israelhai chunga a ṭhatna chuong zozai ân langtir lei chun lungril hlim le lâwmtakin an in tieng an fe tâwl tah a."
