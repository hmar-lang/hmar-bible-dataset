1,"And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.","Chun, Jezreel mi Naboth chun grêp huon a nei a, chu chu Jezreela Samari lal Ahab in bul ela um a nih."
2,"And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.","Chun, Ahab chun Naboth chu, “Ka in bul a ni lei hin i grêp huon hi thlai huon dingin mi pe raw khai, a aia chun grêp huon ṭha lem pêng ka ti che; annawleh i nuom lem chun a tangkain a man tâwk chu pêng ka ti che,” a ta, a biek a."
3,"And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.","Chun, Naboth chun Ahab kuom- ah, “Ka puhai ro hang pêk che chu ka ta dingin a âwmin a âwm nawh ie,” a tih a."
4,"And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.","Chun, Jezreel mi Naboth chun a kuoma chuong ang thu chu a hril lei chun Ahab chu ngûitak le lungâwi nawtakin a inah a lût tah a, “Ka puhai ro pe thei naw ning che,” a ti tlat sih a. Chuongchun, a khuma chun a zâl a, khingtieng a nghah a, bu hrim hrim khawm a fâk nuom ta nawh a."
5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?","Chuongchun, a nuhmei Jezebel chu a va feh a, a kuomah, “Iengtiziea i lungril chuong lâwma a lungngai a, bu hrim hrim i fâk naw am a ni leh?” a ta."
6,"And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Jezreel mi Naboth chu ka va biek a, a kuomah, ‘I grêp huon hi min châwktir rawh, annawleh i dit lem chun a aiah grêp huon dang pêng ka ti che,’ ka tih a, ama chun, ‘Ka grêp huon chu pe thei naw ning che,’ tiin a mi dawn annâwm ie,” a ta."
7,"And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.","Chun, a nuhmei Jezebel chun a kuomah, “Israel ram lal hi i nih a ni naw am a nih? Tho la, bu fa la, lungril hlimtakin um raw khai, Jezreel mi Naboth grêp huon chu keiin pêng ka ti che,” a ta."
8,"So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth.","Chuongchun, Ahab hming chun lekha a ziek a, a namna chun a nam a; chun, lekha chu a umna khuoa Naboth tuolbâwm upahai le mi ṭhahai kuomah ân phur a."
9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:","Chun, lekhaa chun, “Bu nghei thu lo phuong unla, mipui lai Naboth chu inhmatâwngtir unla,"
10,"and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death.","mi pahni Belial nauhai a hmaa chun inṭhungtir unla, ‘Pathien le lal i hrilsiet a nih,’ tia a hêktu dingin lo siem ro. Chun, ama chu ṭhuoi suok unla, lo dêng hlum ro,” a ta."
11,"And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.","Chun, a umna khuoa mi, a umna khuoa um upahai le mi ṭhahai chun Jezebelin ân phur lekhaa a ziek ang chun an thawh a."
12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.","Bu nghei thu chu an phuong a, mipuihai lai Naboth chu an inhma- tâwngtir a."
13,"And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.","Chun, mi pahni Belial nauhai chu a hmaa chun an va ṭhung a; chun, Belial mihai chun mipuihai hmaa chun, “Naboth hin Pathien le lal a hrilsiet a nih,” tiin ama Naboth chu an hêk a. Chuongchun, khuoa in- thawk chun an ṭhuoi suok a, lungin an dêng a, a thi tah a."
14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.","Chuongchun, Jezebel kuoma chun, “Naboth chu lungin an dêng a, a thi tah,” tiin mi an tir a."
15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.","Chun, Jezebelin Naboth chu lungin an dêng a, a thi tah ti a hrietin Jezebel chun Ahab kuoma chun, “Tho la, Jezreel mi Naboth grêp huon, ân châwktir phal naw che kha nei ta raw le, Naboth chu a dam ta nawh a, a thi tah a nih,” a ta."
16,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.","Chun, Ahab chun Naboth a thi tah ti a hrietin Jezreel mi Naboth grêp huon chu nei dinga fe thla dingin Ahab chu a tho tah a."
17,"And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Tisbe mi Elija kuoma chun a hung tlung tah a."
18,"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.","“Tho la, Samari khuoa um, Israel lal Ahab be dingin zu fe raw khai, ngai ta, Naboth grêp huona chun a um a; nei tumin chutaka chun a fe thla a nih."
19,"And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.","A kuoma chun, ‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, I that a, i neipêk nâwk nghâl a ni maw? tiin,’ ti la, a kuomah, ‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, Uiin Naboth thisen an liekna hmun ngeia hin nanga thisen khawm hi an liek ve ding a nih, tiin,’ ti rawh,” a tih a."
20,"And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee, because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah.","Chun, Ahab chun Elija kuomah, “I mi hung hmu ta maw, ka hmêl- mapa?” a ta. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Ka hmu ta che a ni hi, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw thaw dingin inzawr ta che chu."
21,"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel:","Ngai ta, i chunga hin thil ṭha- naw hung intlungtir ka ta, hung suk- bohmang ka ti cheh a, Ahaba inthawk hin naupasal taphawt chu Israel rama mi khuokhira um amanih, khuokhir naw amani khawm chu sukbohmang ka ta,"
22,"and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin.","nangin i mi suklungsen lei le, Israelhai chu thil în suksuoltir leiin Nebat naupa Jeroboam sûnghai le Ahija naupa Baasa sûnghai ang elin i sûnghai hi siem ka tih,” a ta."
23,"And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.","Chun, Jezebel chungchâng thu khawm LALPAIN a hril a, “Jezreel khaw kul bulah Jezebel hi uiin la fâng an tih."
24,Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.,"Ahab sûngkuohai laia mi khawpuia thihai po chu uiin fâng an ta; rama thihai po chu chunglêng vatehaiin fâng an tih,” tiin."
25,"(But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.","(A nuhmei Jezebel infuipawr a, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw thaw dinga inzawr Ahab ang hrim hrim hi tukhawm an um nawh."
26,"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.)","LALPAIN Israel thlahai hmaa a hnawtsuok Amor mihai thilthaw tin- rêng ang, milimhai bein thil tirdak- umtakin a thaw hlak a)."
27,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.","Chun, Ahab chun chuong thu chu a hriet chun a puon a keithlêr a, saiip puon a sil a, bu a nghei a, saiip puon chungah a zâl a, ngûitakin ân lawn vêl a."
28,"And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Tisbe mi Elija kuoma chun a hung tlung a,"
29,"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s day will I bring the evil upon his house.","“Ahab ka hmaa an ngaitlâwm- zie hi i hmu am? Ka hmaa an ngai- tlâwm lei hin ama dam sûng hin chu a chungah thil ṭha naw intlungtir naw ning, a naupaa inthawk ruok chun a sûnghai chungah thil ṭha naw in- tlungtir ka tih,” tiin."
