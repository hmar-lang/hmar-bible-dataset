1,"And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.","Suria lal Benhadad chun sipaihai po po chu ân khâwm vawng a, lal sâwmthum le pahni an ṭhang a, sakawr le tawlailîrhai leh a hang feh a, Samari khuo chu a hang inhuol a, a hang thawh a."
2,"And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,","Israel lal Ahab kuoma chun khawpui sûngah mi a tir a, a kuomah, “Benhadad chun hieng ang hin a tih,"
3,"Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.","‘I tangka le i rângkachakhai kha ka ta a nih, i nuhmeihai le, i nauhai laia a ṭha ṭhahai kha ka ta vawng a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
4,"And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have.","Chun, Israel lal chun a lo dawn a, “Aw laltak ka pu, i hril ang chu a ni annâwm, keima le ka nei po po chu i ta a nih,” a ta."
5,"And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, I sent indeed unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;","Chun, a mi tirhai chu an fe nâwk a, “Benhadad chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘I kuomah, i tangkahai, i rângka- chakhai, i nuhmeihai le i nauhai leh i mi pêk ding a nih, tiin mi ka hung tir luoh a;"
6,"but I will send my servants unto thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.","amiruokchu, zîngah hi pha vêla hin ka mihai i kuomah hung tir ka ta, i in le i mihai inhai chu an hung dap ding a nih; chun, i thil ngainat zâwng- hai chu lâng an ta, hung pui vawng an tih,’ tiin,” an ta."
7,"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.","Chuongchun, Israel lal chun a rama upahai po po chu a ko a, “Lo hre ta u khai, hi mipa hin thil ṭha nawtak thaw a tumzie hi; ka kuomah mi a hung tir a, ka nuhmeihai, ka nauhai, ka tangka dâm, ka rângkachak dâm a hung ngên a, ka lo sêl hlak khawm ni si loin,” a ta."
8,"And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken thou not, neither consent.","Chun, upahai po po le mipuihai po po chun a kuomah, “Lo bengkhawn nuom naw rawh, rem khawm lo tipêk naw rawh,” an ta."
9,"Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.","Chuongchun, Benhadad mitirhai kuoma chun, “Laltak ka pu kuoma chun, ‘I siehlaw kuoma mi tira i hung ngên hmasak ang po po khan chu thâwng ka ta, amiruokchu, hi hi chu chu thaw thei naw ning, a tih,’ ti ro,” a ta. Chun, a mitirhai chu an fe nâwk tah a, chu thu chu an vân tlun nâwk a."
10,"And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.","Chun, Benhadad chun a kuom- ah mi a tir nâwk a, “Ka hnungzuitu- hai po po hin Samari khaw pilvut veikhat chau khawm an changkim thei ding chun pathienhaiin an law law mi law hai sienla, chu nêka nasa khawm a,” a ta."
11,"And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his armor boast himself as he that putteth it off.","Chun, Israel lal chun a dawn a, “‘Mi ân râlthuom zing laiin, ân râl- thuomna hlîp thla ta ang elin an uong ngai nawh ie,’ tiin va hril ro khai,” a ta."
12,"And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.","Chun, ama le a lalhaiin bûktêah zu an lo dâwn laiin, chu thu chu Benhadad chun a lo hriet a, a mihai kuoma chun, “Insiem ro khai,” a ta. Chuongchun, khuo chu do ding chun an insiem tah a."
13,"And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, ngai ta, zâwlnei pakhat hin Israel lal Ahab chu a va hnai a, “LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Hieng mipui tamtak hi i hmu am? ngai ta, vawisûn hin i kutah ka pêk ding a nih; chuongchun, kei hi LALPA chu ka nih ti hrieng i tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
14,"And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.","Chun, Ahab chun, “Tu hmangin am ie?” a ta. Ama chun, “LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ram bunghaia tlangvâl hotuhai hmang hin,’ tiin,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Tuin am râlrêl a ta?” a ta. Ama chun a dawn a, “Nang- in teh,” a ta."
15,"Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.","Chuongchun, ama chun ram bunghaia hotu tlangvâlhai chu a ko khâwm a, za hni le sâwmthum le pahni an na; chuhai zoa chun mi po po, Israel thlahai po po chu a ko khâwm a, sâng sari an nih."
16,"And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.","Chun, sûnchang laitakin an va suok tah a. Benhadad le lalhai, ama ṭhangpuitu lal sâwmthum le pahni- hai ruok chu an bûktêa chun an lo indâwn rui a."
17,"And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.","Chun, ram bunghaia hotu tlangvâlhai chu an va suok hmasah a, chun, Benhadad chun mi a tir a, anni chun, “Samari khuoa inthawka hung suok an um,” tiin an hril a."
18,"And he said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they are come out for war, take them alive.","Ama chun, “Inrem tuma hung an ni chun a hringin lo man unla, indo tuma hung an ni chun a hring bawkin lo man ro,” a ta."
19,"So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.","Chuongchun, chuonghai, ram bunga hotuhai tlangvâlhai chu a hung zuitu sipaihai le chun khuoa inthawk chu an suok a."
20,"And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.","Chun, an va bitum senghai chu an va that a, chuongchun, Suria mi- hai chu an tlânse tah a, Israelhai chun an hnawt a, chun, Suria lal Benhadad chu sakawr chunga chuongin sakawr chung chuong mi- hai leh an tlânsuok tah a."
21,"And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.","Chun, Israel lal chu a va suok a, sakawr le tawlailîrhai chu a va thawh a, Suria mihai chu a va that rak el a."
22,"And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.","Chun, zâwlnei chun Israel lal chu a va hnai a, a kuomah, “In- sukhrât sau sau la, i thaw dân ding ngaituo raw khai, kum a hung invawi hin Suria lal chun a hung thaw nâwk ding che a nih,” a ta."
23,"And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.","Chun, Suria lalhai chun a kuomah, “An pathien hi tlâng pathien a na, chuleiin, eini nêkin an hrât a ni hi, phaizâwlah thaw ta inla, anni nêk chun hrât lem ngei ei tih."
24,"And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;","Chun, hieng ang hin thaw rawh, lalhai hi an rêngin thleng vawng la, an aia hin ram awptuhai sie lem la,"
25,"and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.","chun, sipaihai tawlailîr dâm, sakawr dâm, i chân ta zât ang chie kha sipaihai siemṭha nâwk la; chuongchun, phaizâwla thâwng kan ta, anni nêk chun hrât lem ngei kan tih,” an ta. Chun, an thu chu a awi a, chuong ang chun a thaw tah a."
26,"And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.","Chun, a kum nâwka chun Benhadad chun Suria mihai chu a kei khâwm a, Israelhai chu thaw dingin Aphek khuoa chun a hang feh a."
27,"And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.","Chun, Israel thlahai chu an pungkhâwm a, fâk dinghai an thak zet zet a, thaw dingin an inthawk tah a; chun, Israel thlahai chun kêlte tlâwmte ruol hni ang chau tê hin an va ep veh a; Suria mihai ruok chu a ram sip hin an sip mup el a."
28,"And a man of God came near and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, Pathien mi chun Israel lal chu a va hnai a, a va biek a, a kuomah, “LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Suria mihaiin LALPA chu tlâng- hai pathien a na, ruom pathien chu a ni nawh an ti a nih; chuleiin, hieng mipui tamtakhai hi i kutah ka pêk ding a nih; chuongchun, kei hi LALPA chu ka nih ti hrieng in tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
29,"And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.","Chun, ni sari sûng zet chu an inep zing a. Chun, a ni sari ni chun an inthaw tah a; chun, Israel mihai chun Suria mihai chu ni khatah sipai nuoi khat an that a."
30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.","Mi danghai ruok chu Aphekah khawpui sûnga chun an tlânlût a, a la umhai chu mi sîng hni le sâng sari kul chimin a delhlum a. Chun, Benhadad chu a tlânseh a, khawpui sûnga pindan sûngrila a lût a."
31,"And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.","Chun, a rawihai chun a kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, Israel sûng kuohai laia lalhai hi mi lunginsietthei tak an nih ti thu kan hriet a, saiip puon bilin, ei lua hin hruia inkhitin Israel lal kuomah mi vân fetir raw khai; ama chun a hla nuom khiet che rawi mawh,” an ta."
32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.","Chuongchun, saiip puon chu an bil a, an lua chun hruiin an inkhit a, Israel lal kuoma chun an va feh a, “I siehlaw Benhadad chun, ‘Lunginsiet- takin mi hla raw se,’ a ti che,” an ta. Ama chun, “A la dam a ni maw? Ka naupa a ni annâwm,” a ta."
33,"Now the men observed diligently, and hasted to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.","Chuong mihai chun ngaiṭha- takin, a lungril thu tak a hril a ni ringin, “I unaupa Benhadad kha a nih,” an lo ti var a. Chuongchun, ama chun, “Va fe unla, ama chu hung ṭhuoi ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, Benhadad chu a hung suok a, a kuomah a feh a; chun, ama chun tawlailîrah a lo in- chuongtir a."
34,"And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I, said Ahab, will let thee go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.","Chun, Benhadad chun a kuom- ah, “Ka pain i pa kuoma inthawka khuo a lo lâkhai kha pe kîr nâwk ka ta; chun, ka pain Samari khuoa dâwrpui hmun a siem ang khan Damaska khuoah i dâwrpui hmun ding i siem ve ding annâwm,” a ta. Chun, Ahab chun, “Hi thuthlung le hin infetir ka ti che,” a ta. Chuong- chun, a kuomah thu a thlung a, ân fetir tah a."
35,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of Jehovah, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.","Chun, zâwlnei naupahai laia mi pakhat hin LALPA thuin a ruolpa kuomah, “Mi hang vaw ta khai,” a ta."
36,"Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.","Ama chun a vuok nuom nawh a, Chuongchun, a kuomah, “LALPA thu chu i awi naw leiin, ngai ta, nang hin i mi liemsan phingleh, sakeibakneiin lo sêng a ti che,” a ta. Chun, ama chu a liemsan phingle chun sakeibak- neiin a lo hmuh a, a se tah a."
37,"Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.","Chuongchun, mi dang a va hmu nâwk a, “Mi hang vaw ta khai,” a ta. Ama chun a hang vuok a, a vuok sil tah a."
38,"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.","Chuongchun, zâwlnei chu a feh a, lampuia hin lal chu a lo inchân a, a chal khitnaa a mit inkhumin ân siem danglam a."
39,"And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.","Chun, lal a hung tlung chun lal chu a lo ko a, “I siehlaw hin indona rûnpui hmunah ka va feh a; chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat hi a hung nghah a, ka kuomah mi pakhat a hung ṭhuoi a, ‘Ama hi lo vêng tlat rawh, a tlân- hmang hlau chun a hringna aiah i hringna chân i tih, annawleh tangka talent khat i pêk ding a nih,’ a ta."
40,"And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.","Chun, i siehlaw hi ka buoi êm kâr chun a lo fe hmang dai el tah a,” a ta. Chun, Israel lal chun a kuomah, “Chuong ang tak chu a nih, i chunga thu tlu chu, nangma ngeiin i suk- thlûk diem ta chu teh,” a ta."
41,"And he hasted, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.","Chun, ama chun a mita inthawk chun a chal khitna chu a hlîp ta vak a; chun, Israel lal chun zâwlneihai laia mi a nih ti a hriet tah a."
42,"And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ṭawngsie ka înphur ta chu în suo ta leiin a hringna aiah i hringna; a mihai aiah i mihai chân i tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
43,"And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.","Chun, Israel lal chu ngûitak le lungâwi nawtakin a fe tah a; Samari khuoa chun a fe tah a."
