1,And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.,"Chun, Tura lal Hiram chun Solomon kuoma chun a siehlaw- hai a tir a, a pa aia lal dingin hriek an nâl ti a lo hriet sih a; Hiram chu David ngainatu a ni rawp hlak hrim a."
2,"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,","Chun, Solomon chun Hiram kuoma chun,"
3,"Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Jehovah his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet.","“Ka pa David khan LALPAIN a hmêlmahai a ke hnuoia a sie hmakhat khan chu a vêl kil tin kil tanga indonahai lei khan, LALPA a Pathien hming dingin in a bâwl thei nawh ti i hriet a."
4,"But now Jehovah my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.","Tu ruok hin chu LALPA ka Pathien chun kil tinah muongna a mîn neitir tah a, hmêlmahai khawm an um ta naw bawk a."
5,"And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for my name.","Chun, LALPA chun ka pa David kuoma, ‘I naupa i aia i lalṭhungpha kân hluotir ding chun ka hming dingin in chu la bâwl a tih,’ tia a lo hril ta ang khan, LALPA ka Pathien hming dinga in bâwl ka tum a."
6,Now therefore command thou that they cut me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that knoweth how to cut timber like unto the Sidonians.,"Chuongchun, Lebanon tlânga mi sidar thinghai mi phûrpêk dingin thu pe la, ka siehlawhai khawm i sie- hlawhai lai hung ṭhang vêng an ta; chun, i siehlawhai hlaw ding chu i hril ang taphawtin pe pei ka ti che; Zidon mihai anga thing phûr thiem keini lai tukhawm an um nawh ti i hriet sih a,” tiin mi a tir a."
7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.","Chun, Hiramin Solomon thu a lo hriet chun a lâwm ta êm êm el a, “Hieng mi tamtak chunga rorêl dinga naupa vartak David kuoma petu LALPA chu vawisûn hin inpâkin um raw se,” a ta."
8,"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard the message which thou hast sent unto me: I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.","Chun, Hiram chun Solomon kuomah, “I thu mi hung incha chu ka lo hriet a, sidar thing thu le fâr thing chu i mamaw ang peiin lo thâwng ka tih."
9,"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.","Ka siehlawhaiin Lebanon tlânga inthawkin tuisuoriet chenin hung la thlâng an ta; chun, i hmun mi ruotpêk dinga tuisuorieta tawl dingin intêltir ka ta; chun, chu hmuna chun insuttir ka ta, nangin lo lâng i ta; chun, nang khawma ka sûngkuohai fâk ding tumin ka mamaw chu i lo phuhrûk ve thung ding annâwm,” tiin mi a tir a."
10,So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.,"Chuongchun, Hiram chun sidar thing le fâr thing chu Solomon chu a mamaw ang ang chun a pêk a."
11,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.","Chun, Solomon chun Hiram chu a sûngkuohai fâk dingin bu tekhâwng sîng hni le hriek sâwr tekhâwng sâwmhni a pêk a, chu chu Solomonin kum tina Hiram a pêk ang dân chu a nih."
12,"And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.","Chun, LALPAIN a tiem ang ngeiin Solomon chu varna a pêk a, chun, Hiram le Solomon inkâra chun inremna a um a, an pahni chun thu an thlung ve ve tah a."
13,And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.,"Chun, lal Solomon chun Israel mihai po po laia chun mi sinthawa ruoi lui pâwl a siem a; ruoi lui pâwl chu mi sîng thum an nih."
14,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the men subject to taskwork.","Lebanona chun thla khata in- thlâk peiin sîng khat a tir hlak a, thla khat Lebanona chun an hang um a, thla hni chu anni in tieng, Adoniram chu sinthawa ruoi luihai hotu a nih."
15,"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains;","Chun, Solomon chun thil phur mi sîng sari le, lung sut mi sîng riet tlânghaia chun a nei a;"
16,"besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.","Chuonghai chu tiem loin Solomon chun a sin chunga hotubîk, sinthaw vêngtu sâng thum le za thum a nei bawk a."
17,"And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone.","Chun, lal thupêk angin lung- phûm chu lung sutsaa rem dingin lung lientak tak el, lung man tamtak takhai an hung lâk a."
18,"And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.","Chun, in bâwltuhai Solomon mihai le Hiram mihai le Gebal mihai chun lunghai chu an sut a, in bâwlna ding chun thing le lunghai chu an buotsai a."
