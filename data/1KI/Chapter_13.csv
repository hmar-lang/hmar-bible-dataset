1,"And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Jehovah unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.","Chun, ngai ta, Judai rama inthawkin Pathien mi, LALPA thuin Bethelah a hang feh a, chun, Jeroboam chu riminhnik raw dingin maichâm bula chun a lo ngîr a."
2,"And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall they burn upon thee.","Chun, LALPA thuin maichâm chu a hrângkhum a, “Aw maichâm, maichâm, LALPA CHUN HIENG ANG HIN A TIH, ‘Ngai ta, David sûnghai laiah naupa a hming Josia la hung pieng a ta, i chunga riminhnik raw hlaktu, bâwlhmun thiempuhai hi i chunga hin inthâwina dingin la hung inhlân a tih, i chunga hin mihriem ruhai la hung râwng an tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
3,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.","Chun, chu ni ma chun inchikna a pêk a, “Hi hi LALPAIN inchikna ding a ti chu a nih, ‘Ngai ta, maichâm hi la kawi phawk a ta, a chunga meivâm- hai hi lân baw vawng a tih,’ ti hi,” tiin."
4,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.","Chun, Pathien miin Bethela maichâm a hang hrângkhum lalin a lo hriet chun, Jeroboam chun, “Man ro,” tiin maichâma inthawk chun a kutin a hei ban a. Chun, man tuma a banna kut chu a hung zeng tah a, chuongchun, a kut chu a lâk nâwk thei ta nawh a."
5,"The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.","Pathien miin LALPA thua in- chikna ding a hril ang khan maichâm khawm chu a kawi phawk a, mai- châma meivâmhai chu ân baw ta vawng a."
6,"And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, Pathien mi kuoma chun, “Ka kut hi a hung dam nâwk theina dingin LALPA i Pathien ngên la, mi ṭawngṭaipêk ta khai,” a ta. Chun, Pathien mi chun LALPA kuoma chun a ngên a; chun, lal kut chu a hung dam nâwk tah a, a hma ang bawkin a hung um nâwk tah a."
7,"And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.","Chuongchun, lal chun Pathien mi kuoma chun, “Ka in tieng ka kuomah hung la, va châwl hadam hri raw khai, chun, lâwmman khawm ka pêk ding che annâwm,” a ta."
8,"And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;","Chun, Pathien mi chun lal kuom- ah, “I insûng zâtve khawm mi pe ding ni la, i kuoma chun hung chuong naw ning ah, hi hmuna hin bei ka fâkin tui hrim hrim khawm ka dâwn ding a ni nawh;"
9,"for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.","‘Bei va fain, tui hrim hrim khawm va dâwn naw la, i va fena lampuia khawm kîr nâwk ta naw rawh,’ tia LALPA thua tir ka nih i sawnnaw,” a ta."
10,"So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.","Chuongchun, lampui dangah a feh a, Bethel hung pana a hungna lampuia chun a fe nâwk ta nawh a."
11,"Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father.","Chuong lai chun Bethel khuoa chun zâwlnei tar pakhat hi a um a, a naupasalhai chun chu nia Bethela Pathien mi thilthawhai po po chu ama chu an hril vawng a; lal kuoma a thu hril khawm chu an pa an hril a."
12,"And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah.","Chun, an pa chun an kuomah, “Khaw tieng lampui am a fe ta leh?” a ta. A naupasalhai chun Juda rama inthawka hung Pathien mi fe nâwkna lampui chu an khîkhmuh a."
13,"And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon.","Chuongchun, a naupasalhai kuomah, “Sabengtung mi hung siem- pêk ta u,” a ta. Chuongchun, sabeng- tung chu an siempêk a, a chuong tah a."
14,"And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.","Chun, Pathien mi chu a hnawt tah a, thingsaisaw hnuoia ṭhung hi a va hmuh a, a kuomah, “Nang hi i ni maw Juda rama inthawka hung Pathien mi chu?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Nih e,” a ta."
15,"Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.","Chuongchun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ka in tieng ka kuomah hung la, bei va fa raw khai,” a ta."
16,"And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:","Chun, ama chun, “I ruola kîr nâwk thei ka ni nawh a, i kuoma hung thei khawm ka ni bawk nawh; hi hmuna hin i kuomah bei fa naw ning a, tui hrim hrim khawm dâwn naw ning ah."
17,"for it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.","‘Bei va fain tui hrim hrim khawm va dâwn naw la, i va fena lampuia khawm kîr nâwk ta naw rawh,’ tiha, LALPA thua hril ka ni sih a” a ta."
18,"And he said unto him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Kei khawm nanga ang bawka zâwlnei ka ni annâwm, vântirkoin, LALPA thuin, ‘Bei dâm fah a, tui dâm dâwn dingin i in tieng ṭhuoikîr nâwk raw khai,’ tiin a mi biek i sawnnaw,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, a kuoma chun khêl a hril a nih."
19,"So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.","Chuongchun, a kuoma chun a kîr ve nâwk a, a ina chun bei dâm a fâkin tui dâm a dâwn tah a."
20,"And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet that brought him back;","Chun, dawkân an awt lai chun a ṭhuoi kîrtu zâwlnei kuomah LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a;"
21,"and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the commandment which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,","Juda rama inthawka hung Pathien mi kuoma chun, “LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, LALPA thuhril i awi nawh a, LALPA i Pathienin thu a pêk che i pawm naw lei le,"
22,"but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.","i hung kîr nâwk a, ‘Bei va fain, tui hrim hrim khawm va dâwn naw rawh,’ a tina hmun ngeiah, bei i fâk a, tui dâm i dâwn leiin i ruong hi i puhai thlâna sie ni ve naw nih, tiin,” tiin a hril suok tah a."
23,"And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.","Chun, bei dâm a fâk a, tui dâm a dâwn zo chun zâwlnei a ṭhuoi kîr nâwk chu sabengtung a siem- pêk a."
24,"And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.","Chun, a fe chu lampuia chun sakeibaknei leh an intuok tah a; a lo se tah a; a ruong chu lampuia chun inthal dêr hin a um a, sabengtung chu a kâwla chun a ngîr a, sakeibaknei khawm chu ruong bula chun a ngîr ve zing a."
25,"And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.","Chun, ngai ta, mihai an va feh a, lampuia ruong inthal dêra um le, ruong bula sakeibaknei ngîr zing chu an va hmuh a, zâwlnei tartak umna khuoa chun an va hril a."
26,"And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah: therefore Jehovah hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake unto him.","Chun, lampuia va ṭhuoi kîr nâwktu zâwlnei chun chu thu chu a lo hriet phing chun, “Pathien mi, LALPA thu hril awi nuom nawpa kha a ni chu; LALPAIN a kuoma a hril, a thu ang peiin, LALPAIN sakeibaknei kuomah a pêk a, a lo ham a, a se hlum tah a ni chu,” a ta."
27,"And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it.","Chun, a naupasalhai kuoma chun, “Sabengtung mi siemrêlpêk ta u,” tiin a hril a. Chun, an siempêk tah a."
28,"And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the ass.","Chun, a fe tah a, a ruong lampuia inthal dêra lo um le, sabeng- tung le sakeibaknei ruong bula lo ngîr zing chu a va hmuh a; sakeibaknei chun ruong chu a lo la fâk nawh a, sabengtung khawm chu a lo la sukpawp naw bawk a."
29,"And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.","Chun, zâwlnei chun Pathien mi ruong chu ân hlawm a, sabengtung chunga chun a sie kai a, a kîrpui nâwk tah a; chuongchun, zâwlnei putar umna khuoa chun sûn ding le vûi dingin a lût tah a."
30,"And he laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!","Chun, a ruong chu ama thlâna chun ân zâl a, chuongchun, “A va pawi ngei maw, ka unaupa,” tiin a ṭah a."
31,"And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.","Chun, a vûi hnung chun a nau- pasalhai kuomah, “Ka thi pha chun Pathien mi phûmna thlâna hin mi hung phûm ve unla; a ru bula chun ka ruhai hi hung sie unla."
32,"For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.","Pathien thua Bethela maichâm le, Samari ram khawpuihaia bâwl- hmun inhai po po a hrângkhumna thu kha hung tlung ngei ngei ding a ni sih a,” tiin a hril a."
33,"After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.","Chuong thil hnunga khawm chun Jeroboam chun a umdân indik- naw chu a la bân chuong nawh a, vântlâng laia mihai bâwlhmun thiempu dingin a la siem ta rawp a; bâwlhmun thiempuhai an um theina dingin a nuom taphawthai chu a la suktum ta rawp a."
34,"And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.","Chun, thil chu Jeroboam sûng- kuo suolna, anni ngei sukchimittu le khawvêla inthawka sukbohmang hlautu a hung ni tah a."
