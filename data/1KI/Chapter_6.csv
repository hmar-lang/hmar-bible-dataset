1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Jehovah.","Israel thlahai Aigupta rama an suok chena inthawk kum za li le kum sâwmrietna kum, Israelhai chunga Solomon inlal kum lina, Ziv thla, thla hninaa chun LALPA in bâwl chu a ṭan a."
2,"And the house which king Solomon built for Jehovah, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.","Chun, Solomonin LALPA ta dinga a in bâwl chu a dung tieng tawng sâwmruk a na, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmhni a na, ân sâng tieng chu tawng sâwmthum a nih."
3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.","Chun, chu ina Hmun inthieng hmaa tuolpûk chu a in khang tieng chen tawng sâwmhnia sei a na, a hma tienga mi khang tieng chu tawng sâwm a nih."
4,And for the house he made windows of fixed lattice-work.,"Chun, ina chun tukverhai a sûnga inthawka a puotienga chîn zuihai chu a siem a."
5,"And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about.","Chun, in bang vêlin, biekna in bang vêla khawm, biekna hmun inthieng bang vêla khawm chun, chu in bang sik chun in sâwng nei a bâwl a; chun, a vêl el chun pindanhai a siem a;"
6,"The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.","a sâwng hnuoi hnung tak chu a khang tieng tawng nga a na, a laia mi chu a khang tieng tawng ruk a na, a pathumna chu a khang tieng tawng sari a nih; kalkhanghai chu in banga chun rawl ngai loin, a puotienga chun a vêlin a bang hrûla chun ân nghatna a siem a."
7,"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.","Chun, in chu an bâwl lai chun, lung a chona hmuna sut sa vawnga bâwl a na, chuongchun, an bâwl sûng po chu tubau ri dâm, hreipui ri dâm, thîr hriemhrei ri hrim hrim chu ina chun hriet a ni nawh a."
8,"The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.","Pindan lailungtakhai kawtkhâr chu, chu in changtieng panga chun a um a, a laia chun kailâwn inhera hin an lâwn kai a; chun, a lailunga inthawk chun a pathumnaah."
9,"So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.","Chuongchun, in chu a hang bâwl a, a zo tah a, in chu sidar tlungpûm le a phêkin ân khum a."
10,"And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.","Chun, a in sâwng neihai chu in sik vawngin tawng nga senga insângin a bâwl a; chuonghai chu in le chun sidar thinga zawm a nih."
11,"And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Solomon kuomah a hung tlung a,"
12,"Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father.","“Hi in bâwl lai mêk chungchâng thu hi ka thuruothai i pawm a, ka rorêlhai i zâwm a, ka thupêk po pohai zâwm dinga i pawm phawt chun, i pa David kuoma ka lo hril tah ka thu kha i chungah sukdet ka tih."
13,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.","Chun, Israel thlahai laia hin chêng ka ta, ka mi Israelhai hi thlathlam naw ning ah,” tiin."
14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun in chu a bâwl a, a zo tah a."
15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.","In sûng tienga bang ding chun sidar thingphêk a hmang a, a ṭuonga inthawka a inchung thuo bang chen chun thingphêk a bel vawng a, a ṭuonga chun fâr thing phêk a pha sah a."
16,"And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls of the ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.","Chun, in chawrtieng pang tawng sâwmhni chu a ṭuonga in- thawka a bang chenin sidar thing- phêkhaiin a siem vawng a, a biekna hmun, Hmun Inthieng tak ta ding khawm chun a sûngtienga chun a hmang a."
17,"And the house, that is, the temple before the oracle, was forty cubits long.","Chun, biekna hmun hma tieng biek in sûng chu a dung tawng sâwm- li a na."
18,"And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.","Chun, insûng tienga chun a kumûm le a pâr, pâr lima ker mawi sidar thing a um a, a rêng chun sidar thing vawng a nih; lung hrim hrim ân lang nawh a."
19,"And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA thuthlung bâwm siena dingin a sûngah hmun in- thiengtak a buotsai a."
20,"And within the oracle was a space of twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.","Chun, chu hmun inthiengtak chu a dung tieng tawng sâwmhni, a khang tieng tawng sâwmhni, ân sâng tieng tawng sâwmhni a nih; chu chu rângkachak hlirhlakin ân luon a; chun, sidar maichâm chu ân luon bawk a."
21,So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.,"Chuongchun, Solomon chun chu in sûng tieng chu rângkachak in- thiengin ân luon vawng a; chun, hmun inthiengtak hma tieng chu rângkachak khaidiethaiin a daidan a; chu chu rângkachakin ân luon a."
22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.","Chun, in chu a rênga a zo chenin a pumin rângkachak inthiengin ân luon pei a; hmun inthienga maichâm pumpui khawm chu rângkachak inthiengin ân luon a."
23,"And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.","Chun, hmun inthienga chun tawng sâwmhni ve vea insângin cherub pahni Oliv thingin a siem a."
24,"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.","Cherub thla pakhat chu tawng nga a na, cherub thla khingtieng chu tawng nga bawk a nih; thla pakhat hmawra inthawka thla khingtieng hmawr inkâr chu tawng sâwm a nih."
25,And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.,"Cherub pakhat insângtieng chu tawng sâwm a na, cherubhai chu intie chie le pieng dân inang ve ve a nih."
26,"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.","Cherub pakhat insâng tieng chu tawng sâwm a na, cherub pakhat khawm chu, chu chen bawk chu a nih."
27,"And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.","Chun, cherubhai chu insûng ril lema chun a sieh a; chun, cherubhai thla chu ân zar a, pakhat thla chun bang khingtieng a va tâwk a, cherub pakhat thla khawm chun bang khing- tieng chu a tâwk bawk a; chu in lailungtaka chun an thla le an thla chu ân tâwk a."
28,And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.,"Chun, cherubhai chu rângka- chak inthiengin ân luon a."
29,"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without.","In bang po po chu a vêlin cherubhai intûm thing le pâr par ta sa limhai leh, ker mawiin sûngtieng le a puotienga chun a siem a."
30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.",A in ṭuong chu sûngtieng le a puotienga chun rângkachak in- thiengin ân luon a.
31,And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel and door-posts were a fifth part of the wall.,"Chun, hmun inthiengtak lûtna dinga chun Oliv thingin kawtkhâr a siem a, kawtkhâr lu chung le kawt- khâr bienghai chu a bang hmun ngaa ṭhea hmun khat tie a nih."
32,"So he made two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.","Chuongchun, Oliv thingin kawtkhâr pahni a siem a, chutaka chun cherubhai, intûm thing le pâr par tasahai lim dâm ker mawiin a siem a, chuong chu rângkachakin ân luon a; chun, cherubhai le intûm thinghai chu rângkachak a nâl a."
33,"So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;","Chun, biekin lûtna dingin bang hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat ruolin Oliv kawtkhâr ban a siem bawk a,"
34,"and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.","fâr thing kawtkhâr pahni leh; kawtkhâr pakhata phêk hni chu thlep thei a na, kawtkhâr pakhata phêk hnihai khawm chu thlep thei ma a nih."
35,And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.,"Chuonghaia chun cherubhai, intûm thinghai pâr par tasahai lim chu a ker a, chuong ker mawihai chu innâmtakin rângkachakin ân luon a."
36,"And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.",Biekin huon sûng tuollai sûng- ril lem chu lung sut sâwng thum le sidar thingphêk thuo khatin a siem a.
37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv.","A kum lina Ziv thlaa chun LALPA in lungphûm chu rem a na,"
38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.","chun, kum sâwm le kum khatna Bul thla, thla rietnaah in chu remruot ang chiein, a iengkim chu zo vawng a na. Chuongchun, kum sari sûng a bâwl a nih."
