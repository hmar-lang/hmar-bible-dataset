1,"And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.","Tisbe khuo, Gilead rama Tisbe khuoa mi Elija chun Ahab kuoma chun, “LALPA, a hmaa ka ngîrna hlak, Israelhai Pathien hring- na sâlin ka hril a nih; kum ieng zât amani sûng chu ka thu naw chun ruo le dâidaw tla hrim hrim naw nih,” a ta."
2,"And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu a kuomah a hung tlung a."
3,"Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.","“Hitaka inthawk hi suok la, khawsak tieng panin fe la, Jordan bula um Kerith vadunga chun hang inbihmang rawh."
4,"And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.","Chun, chu vadung tui chu tlân i ta, chutaka châwm ding chein vaâkhai thu ka pêk tah a nih,” tiin."
5,"So he went and did according unto the word of Jehovah; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.","Chuongchun, a feh a, LALPA thu ang chun a thaw tah a; Jordan kâwla um Kerith vadunga chun a hang um tah a."
6,"And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.","Chun, vaâkhai chun zîngkâr hin bei le sâ an hung putpêk hlak a; zântieng chun bei le sâ an hung putpêk nâwk hlak a, chun, vadung tui chu a tlân a."
7,"And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.","Chun, a nakie deu chun hieng hi a hung na, chu rama chun ruo hrim hrim a sûr naw leiin vadung chu a hung kang tah a."
8,"And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu a kuomah a hung tlung a;"
9,"Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.","Tho la, Zidon rama Zarephath khuoah fe la, chutaka chun um rawh; ngai ta, a châwm ding chein hmeithai pakhat thu ka pêk tah,tiin."
10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.","Chuongchun, a tho a, Zarephath khuoa chun a fe tah a; chun, chu khaw kul kawtkhâr chu a va tlung chun, ngai ta, hmeithai pakhat thing inkhâwm hi a lo um a; ama chu a hang ko a, bêlin tui tlâwmte mi hung lapêk ta, hang dâwn ka tih,a ta."
11,"And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.","Chun, la dinga a fe lai chu a hei ko a, bei khawm tlâwmte mi hung chawipêk ta, a ta."
12,"And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.","Ama chun, LALPA i Pathien hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, bei chu chu ka nei nawh a, bêla beiphit vei- khat bak le, bûrah sahriek tlâwmte chau ka nei a; chun, ngai ta, ka feh a, kei le ka naupa ta dinga siemna dingin thingrieu pahni amani chau kân khâwm a na; chuongchun, chu chu fâng kan ta, kan thi el ding a nih,a ta."
13,"And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.","Chun, Elija chun a kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh, i hril ang chun va thaw phawt la, amiruokchu, chu chun bei chite bêk mi hung siempêk phawt la, chu chu mi hung chawipêk la, chu zoa chun i ta ding le i naupa ta ding chu i la siem ding annâwm."
14,"For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the earth.","LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘LALPAIN hnuoi chunga hin ruo a hung insûrtir hmakhat chun bei phit bêl chu ruok chuong naw nih a, sahriek bûr khawm kang naw nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
15,"And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.","Chuongchun, Elija hril ang chun a va thawh a, chun, ama le a sûnghai le Elija le chun ni iengzât lai sûng amanih an ring a."
16,"The jar of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Elijah.","Elija hmanga a hril LALPA thu ang khan, beiphit bêl chu a ruok chuong nawh a, sahriek bûr khawm chu a kang bawk nawh."
17,"And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.","Chun, chuong thil hnunga chun in neitunu, hmeithai naupa chu a na tah a; a na chu a na hle el a; a thuok a tâwp tah a."
18,"And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son!","Chun, ama chun Elija kuomah, “Aw nang Pathien mi, nang le kei hi ieng am ei ni leh? Ka suolna inhriet- suoktir ding le ka naupa mi thatpêk dinga hung i ni hi tie!” a ta."
19,"And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “I naupa chu mi hung pe ta,” a ta. Chuongchun, a pawm lai chu a lâk- pêk a, a umna pindana chun a hang pawm a, ama khuma chun ân zâltir a."
20,"And he cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?","Chun, LALPA chu a ko a, “Aw LALPA ka Pathien, ka umna hmei- thainu chunga hin a naupa hi suk- hlumpêkin thil ṭha naw khawm i hung intlungtir a ni maw?” a ta."
21,"And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.","Chuongchun, naupang chunga chun vawi thum a bawk a, LALPA chu a ko a, “Aw LALPA ka Pathien, lunginsiettakin hi naupang hringna hi amaa hin hung inumtir nâwk rawh,” a ta."
22,"And Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.","Chun, LALPAIN Elija thu chu a lo ngaipêk a, chuongchun, naupang hringna chu amaa chun a hung um nâwk a, a hung har nâwk tah a."
23,"And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.","Elija chun naupang chu a ṭhuoi a, pindana inthawk chun in sûngah a fe thlâkpui a, a nu a pêk tah a; Elija chun, “En ta, i naupa hi a dam nâwk tah,” a ta."
24,"And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth.","Nuhmei chun Elija kuoma chun, “Tu zet hin chu Pathien mi i na, i baua LALPA thu hi thutak a nih ti ka hung hriet tah,” a ta."
