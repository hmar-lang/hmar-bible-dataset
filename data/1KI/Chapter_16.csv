1,"And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,","Chun, Baasa chungchâng thuah Hanani naupa Jehu kuomah LALPA thu a hung tlung a,"
2,"Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;","“Pilvuta inthawkin ka dawm sâng cheh a, ka mi Israelhai chunga hin hotuah ka siem cheh a, chun, nangin Jeroboam lampui hraw chu i hrawh a, an suolnahaia an mi suklungsenna dingin ka mi Israelhai chu thil în suksuoltir a;"
3,"behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","ngai ta, Baasa le a sûnghai hi ka sukbo hlau ding a nih; chuongchun, Nebat naupa Jeroboam sûnghai ang elin i sûnghai hi siem ka tih."
4,Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.,"Baasa sûngkuohai laia khawpuia thi taphawthai chu uiin fâng an ta, chun, a sûngkuo laia mi rama thi taphawthai chu chunglêng vatehaiin fâng an tih,” tiin."
5,"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Baasa chanchin danghai, a thilthaw dâm, a thilthawtheizie dâm chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
6,"And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Baasa chu a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, Tirza khuoah an phûm a; a naupa Ela chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
7,"And moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of Jehovah against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him.","Chun, Baasa le a sûngkuohai chungchâng thua chun a kutsuoka LALPA suklungsenna dinga Jero- boam sûnghai hawina neia LALPA mithmua thil ṭha nawtak a thaw lei le, ama chu a that leiin Hanani naupa zâwlnei Jehu hmanga a hril LALPA thu chu a hung tlung tah a."
8,"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years.","Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwmhni le kum ruknaah Baasa naupa Ela chu Tirza khuoa Israelhai chungah ân lal ṭan a, kum hni sûng ân lal a."
9,"And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:","Chun, a siehlaw Zimri, a taw- lailîr zâtve chunga hotuin ama chu a phier rûk a, chuong lai chun Tirza khuoa chun, Tirza khuoa a insûng tieng hotu Arza inah a lo dâwn in- rui a;"
10,"and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.","chun, Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwmhni le kum sari kum chun Zimri chu a va lût a, a thawh a, a that a, ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
11,"And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.","Chun, ama chu a hang inlal ṭan a, a lalṭhungphaa a hang ṭhung phingle chun, Baasa sûnghai po po chu a that vawng a, a laibunghai le a ruolhai laia mi naupasal taphawt chu pakhat khawm a hla nawh."
12,"Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,","Chuongchun, zâwlnei Jehu hmanga Baasa chungchâng thu a lo hril ta ang khan, Zimri chun Baasa sûnghai po po chu a sukchimit vawng tah a;"
13,"for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.","Lalpa Israelhai Pathien chu an khawhlonaa suklungsenna dinga Israelhai thil insuksuoltira an thaw Baasa suolna po po le, a naupa Ela suolna lei chun."
14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?",Ela chanchin danghai le a thilthawhai po po chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?
15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.","Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwmhni le kum sari kum chun Zimri chu Tirza khuoa chun ni sari ân lal a. Philistin mihai chan, Gibbethon khuo chu mihai chun an inhuol a."
16,"And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.","Chun, ân huoltuhai chun, Zimri chun lal a phier rûk a, lal a that tah ti mi hril an lo hriet a; chuong- chun, Israelhai po po chun sipai ho- tu Omri chu, chu ni chun an riek- hmuna Israelhai lal dingin an siem tah a."
17,"And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.","Omri chu Israelhai po po leh Gibbethon khuoa inthawk chun an hang feh a, Tirza khuo chu an hang inhuol tah a."
18,"And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,","Chun, Zimri chun khuo chu an lâk tah ti a hriet chun, lal ina kula chun a tlânlût a, lal ina chun ân râwkhum a, a thi tah a."
19,"for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.","LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw- takhai thawa a suolnahai lei le Jeroboam lampui hraw chu hraw veh a, Israelhai thil insuksuoltira a suol- na leiin."
20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?",Zimri chanchin danghai le a phier rûkna thuhai chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?
21,"Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.","Chuongchun, Israel mipuihai chu pâwl hniah an hung inṭhe tah a, mipui zâtve chun Ginath naupa Tibni chu lala siem tumin an zui a; chun, a zâtvein Omri chu an zui bawk a."
22,"But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.","Nisienlakhawm, Omri zuituhai chun Ginath naupa Tibni zuituhai chu an hne tah a, chuongchun, Tibni chu a thih a, Omri chu ân lal tah a."
23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, and reigned twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.","Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwm- thum le kum khatnaah Omri chu Israelhai chungah ân lal ṭan a, kum sâwm le kum hni sûng ân lal a; Tirza khuoa chun kum ruk ân lal a."
24,"And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.","Semer ta Samari tlâng chu tangka talent hniin ân châwk a; chun, tlânga chun khuo a siem a; a khaw siem hminga chun chu tlâng neitu Semer hming chawiin Samari ân puttir a."
25,"And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him.",Omri chun LALPA mithmua thil ṭha nawtakhai chu a thaw hlak a; a hmaa mihai po po nêkin a suksuol nasa bîk lem a.
26,"For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.","Nebat naupa Jeroboam thaw- dân po po kha a lâk a, an khawhlona leia LALPA Israelhai Pathien suk- lungsenna dinga Israelhai thil ân suksuoltirna ang khan a suol ve sih a."
27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?",Omri thilthaw chanchin dang- hai le a thilthawtheizie a suklanghai thu chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?
28,"So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Omri chu a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, Samari khuoa chun an phûm a; a naupa Ahab chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
29,And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.,"Juda lal Asa inlal kum sâwm- thum le kum rietnaah Omri naupa Ahab chu Israel chungah ân lal ṭan a; chun, Omri naupa Ahab chu Samari khuoa chun Israelhai chungah kum sâwmhni le kum hni ân lal a."
30,And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah above all that were before him.,"Chun, Omri naupa Ahab chun a hmaa mi po pohai nêkin LALPA hmaa chun thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
31,"And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.","Chun, Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolna ang thaw ve dâm chu ienga khawm ngailo ni âwmtakin, Zidon mihai lal Ethbaal naunu Jezebel nuhmeiah a nei a; Baal rawng dâm bâwlsanin a biek ve ta el a."
32,"And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.",Samari khuoa Baal in a bâwla chun Baal ta dingin maichâm a siem tah a.
33,"And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.","Chun, Ahab chun Asera a siem a; a hmaa Israel lalhai po po nêkin Ahab chun LALPA Israelhai Pathien suklungsenna dingin thil a thaw nasa bîk a nih."
34,"In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.","Ama ân lal lai chun Bethel mi Hielin Jeriko khuo a siem a, a nau- lutîr Abiram chu chânin a lungphûm chu a phûm a; chun, a nau mitlum Segub chu chânin a kul kawtkhâr- hai chu ân ngîr a, LALPAIN Nun naupa Josua hmanga a lo hril ta ang khan."
