1,"Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;","Solomon chun Pharao naunu chau naw khawm hnam dang nuhmei tamtak Moab mi dâm, Ammon mi dâm, Edom mi dâm, Zidon mi dâm, Hit mi nuhmeihai dâm chu a hmangai a;"
2,"of the nations concerning which Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.","chuong hnamhai chungchâng thu chu LALPAIN Israel thlahai kuomah, “Anni chu pâwl naw unla, anni khawma pâwl naw raw hai se cheu; an pathienhai tieng in lungril an kei kâwi ngei âwm sih a,” tiin a lo hril ta hrim a; chuonghai chu Solomon chun hmangainain a chel tlat a."
3,"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.","Chuongchun, nuhmei za sari, lal naunu a nei a, thaikêm za thum leh; chun, a nuhmeihai chun a lungril an ṭhuoi kâwipêk tah a."
4,"For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of David his father.","Chun, Solomon chu a hung upat hnung chun, a nuhmeihai chun pathien dang kuom tienga chun a lungril an ṭhuoi kâwipêk tah a, chuongchun, a pa David lungril angin LALPA a Pathien tienga chun a lung- ril chu a hung ṭha famkim ta nawh a."
5,"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.",Solomon chun Zidon mihai pathiennu Astoreth le Ammon mihai pathien tirdakumtak Milkom chu a lo zui ve tah a.
6,"And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father.","Chun, Solomon chun LALPA mithmua chun thil suol a lo thaw tah a; a pa David ang khan LALPA chu a zui tlat ve ta nawh a."
7,"Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Jerusalem bula tlângah Moab mihai pathien tirdakumtak Kemos ta ding- in le, Ammon mihai pathien tirdak- umtak Molek ta dingin bâwlhmun a lo siem tah a."
8,"And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.",Chuong ang bawk chun hnam dang a nuhmeihai po po an pathien kuoma inthâwia riminhnik raw hlakhai ta ding khawma a siempêk a.
9,"And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,","Chuongchun, LALPA chu Solo- mon chunga chun a lunginsen tah a, LALPA Israelhai Pathien a kuoma vawihni lai inlâr chu a lungrila phatsanin,"
10,"and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded.",pathien danghai a zui ding a ni nawh ti a LALPAIN thu a pêk chu a zâwm naw leiin.
11,"Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.","Chuleiin, LALPAIN Solomon kuoma chun, “Hieng ang hin i hung um tah a, ka thuthlung le ka thuruot pawm dinga thu ka pêk che hi i pawm ta si nawh a, ram hi lâkpêk ngei ngei ka ti cheh a, i siehlaw kuomah pêng ka tih."
12,"Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.","Amiruokchu, i pa David zârah i dam sûng êm chun thaw naw ningah; nisienlakhawm, i naupa chu ka lâkpêk ding a nih."
13,"Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.","Ram po po ruok chu lâkpêk vawng naw ning a, nisienlakhawm, ka siehlaw David lei le ka ithlang Jerusalem lei hin hnam khat chu i naupa kuomah pêng ka tih,” a ta."
14,"And Jehovah raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.","Chun, LALPAIN Edom mi Hadad chu Solomon hmêlma dingin a hung inngîrsuok tah a, ama chu Edom rama lal thla a nih."
15,"For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom","Chun, David Edom rama a um laia an mi thathai phûm dinga sipai hotu Joab a hang feh a, Edom mi, naupasal taphawt chu a hang that vawng hnung khan,"
16,"(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);",Joab le Israel mihai po po chu thla ruk zet Edom rama pasal po po an sukhlum vawng hmakhat chun an um a nih:
17,"that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.","Hadad chu a pa siehlawhai laia Edom mi ṭhenkhathai leh Aigupta rama tlân dingin an feh a, Hadad chu naupang chitê a la nih."
18,"And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.","Midian rama inthawk chun an suok a, Paranah an feh a, chun, Parana inthawk chun mihai an ṭhuoi a, Aigupta ram, Aigupta ram lal Pharao kuom an zu tlung a; ama chun inhai a lo pêk a, fâk dinghai a lo ngaituopêk a, ram dâm a lo pêk bawk a."
19,"And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.","Hadad chun Pharao mit a tlung hle el a, chuongchun, a nuhmei ngei zuorpuinu, lalnu Tahpenes zuorpui chu nuhmeiah ân neitir a."
20,"And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.","Chun, Tahpenes zuorpuinu chun, naupasal Genubath a neipêk a, Tahpenes chun Pharao ina chun a nêne nêk bânna a siempêk a; chun, Genubath chu Pharao nauhai laia chun a um tah a."
21,"And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.","Chun, Hadad chun Aigupta rama inthawka David chu a puhai kuomah a in ve tah ti le, sipai hotu Joab khawm a thi tah ti a lo hrietin, Hadad chun Pharao kuomah, “Ka rama ka fe theina dingin mîn suoktir ta la,” a ta."
22,"Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit only let me depart.","Chuongchun, Pharao chun a kuomah, “Ka kuoma i um hin tlâksam ieng am i nei leh, ngai ta, chuonga in ram tienga fe nâwk i tum el chu?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Ieng dang rak khawm a ni chuong nawh; nisien- lakhawm, mîn fetir hrim hrim el raw khai,” a ta."
23,"And God raised up another adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.","Chun, Pathienin a hmêlma dingin Eliada naupa Rezon, a pu Hadadezer, Zoba lal kuoma inthawka tlânhmang ta kha a hung inngîrsuok nâwk tah a."
24,"And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.","Davidin Zoba khuoa mihai a that khan, ama chun a kuomah mihai a kei khâwm a, sipai hotuah a hung ṭhang tah a; chun, Damaska khuoah an feh a, chutaka chun an um a, Damaska khuoa chun lalin a um tah a."
25,"And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.","Hadad sukrinumna belsain Solomon dam sûng po chu Israelhai hmêlma an ni rawp hrim a; Israelhai chu a theida hle el a, Suria ram sûnga chun ro a rêl a."
26,"And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.","Chun, Nebat naupa Jeroboam, Zereda khuoa Ephraim mi, Solomon siehlaw khawm chun (a nu hming chu Zerua a na, hmeithai a nih) lal chunga chun a kut ân let veh a."
27,"And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.","Lal chunga a kut a hung inletna san chu hieng ang hi a nih; Solomon chun Millo chu a siem a, a pa David khuo chu a sietna laihai chu a siem ṭhah a."
28,"And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.","Chu Jeroboam chu mi hrât huoisen a na, chuongchun, Solomon chun chu tlangvâl chu mi taima- tak niha a hriet leiin Josef sûnghai po po chunga sinthaw hotuah a siem a."
29,"And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.","Chun, chuong lai chun hieng ang hi a hung na, Jeroboam chu Jerusalem khuoa a fe suok chu Silo zâwlnei Ahija chun lampuia chun a lo hmuh a; Ahija chun puon thar hi a sil a, an pahni chau chun phûla chun an um hmunkhat a."
30,"And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.","Chun, Ahija chun a puon thar sil chu a lâk a, her sâwmpahniah a keithlêr a."
31,"And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee","Jeroboam kuoma chun, “Her sâwm hi la raw khai, LALPA Israel- hai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘Ngai ta, ram hi Solomon hi lâkpêk ka ta, hmun sâwm chu ka pêk ding che a nih."
32,"(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);","Amiruokchu, ka siehlaw David lei le, Israel hnam po po laia ka thlang khawpui Jerusalem lei hin hnam khat chu nei a tih,"
33,"because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and mine ordinances, as did David his father.","ama chun a mi mâksan a, Zidon mi pathiennu Astoreth hai, Moabhai pathien Kemos hai, Ammonhai thlahai pathien Milkom hai dâm a biek lei le ka mithmua thilṭha thaw ding le ka thuruothai le ka rorêlhai hi pawm dinga a pa David anga ka lampuihai a hraw naw leiin."
34,"Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;","Ram pumpui chu lâkpêk naw ning a, amiruokchu, ka thupêkhai le ka thuruothai pawmtu ka thlang, ka siehlaw David leiin a dam sûng chu lalah lân umtir hrîng ka tih,"
35,"but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.","nisienlakhawm, ram hi a naupa chu lâkpêk ka ta, nang hi ka pêk ding che a nih, hnam sâwmhai chu."
36,"And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.","Chun, ka siehlaw Davidin ka hming inumtirna dinga ka thlang khawpui Jerusalema hin ka hmaa khâwnvar a nei zing theina dingin hnam khat chu a naupa chu pêng ka tih."
37,"And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.","Nang hi ruot ka ti cheh a, i nuom ang angin ro rêl i ta; Israelhai lalin um i tih."
38,"And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.","Chun, thu ka pêk ang taphawt che i pawm a, ka lampuihai i hrawh a, ka siehlaw David anga ka thuruothai le ka thupêkhai zâwm dinga ka mithmua thilṭha i thaw chun i kuom- ah um pei ka ta, David kân ngîrpêk ang khan sûngkuo nghettak inngîr- pêk ka ti che a, Israelhai hi pêng ka ti che."
39,"And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.","Chuleiin, David thla chu ka sukrinum ding a nih, amiruokchu, kumkhuo chun chu ni naw nih,’ tiin” a tih a."
40,"Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Jeroboam chu that a tum tah a, nisienlakhawm, Jeroboam chu a tho a, Aigupta ramah, Aigupta ram lal Sisak kuomah a tlân tah a, Solomon thi hmakhat chun Aigupta rama chun a um tah a."
41,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?",Solomon chanchin danghai le a thilthaw po pohai le a varna dâm chu Solomon thilthawhai ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?
42,And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.,Solomon chun Israelhai po po chunga Jerusalem khuoa ro a rêl sûng chu kum sâwmli a nih.
43,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Solomon chu a puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, a pa David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a; chun, a naupa Rehoboam chu ama aiaw chun ân lal tah a."
