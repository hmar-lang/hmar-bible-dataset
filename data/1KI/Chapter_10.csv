1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.","Chun, LALPA hming dinga a thilthaw chungchâng thua Solomon hming inthangzie chu Seba lalnuin a lo hriet chun thu khirtak taka fie tumin a kuomah a feh a."
2,"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.","Chun, Jerusalem khuoah, hnung zuitu tamtak ṭhuoiin, thil rim inhnik le rângkachak tamtak le lunghluhai phur sanghâwngseihai ṭhuoiin a feh a; chun, Solomon kuom a tlung chun a lungrila a thu pai po po chu phawr fai rêtin ama a biek a."
3,And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not.,"Chun, Solomon chun a thu in- dawnhai po po chu a dawn fai vawng a, lal ihriet naw, a hrilfie thei naw hrim a um dêr nawh a."
4,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,","Chun, Seba lalnuin Solomon varzie po pohai, a in bâwl dâm,"
5,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.","a dawkâna fâk ding dâm, a upahai ṭhung dân dâm, a rawngbâwl- tuhai chângvêl dân dâm, an inchei dân dâm, a no inhlântuhai dâm, LALPA ina ân hlân pumrawhmang thilinhlâna ân hlânhai a hei hmu chun lungril alêm a nei ta nawh a."
6,"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.","Chuongchun, lal kuoma chun, “I thilthawhai le i varzie hai, keia rama inthawka ka lo hriethai kha thuthang indik tak a lo ni ngei hi tie."
7,"Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.","Nisienlakhawm, keiin ka mit ngeia ka hung hmu hmakhat chun an hril chu ka lo awi nawh a, chuong- chun, ngai ta, a zâtve khawm an mi lo hril naw a nih, an hril ka lo hriet nêkin i varzie le i ṭhatzie a lo nasa hle lem a ni hi."
8,"Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.","I mihai, hieng i siehlaw, i bula um rawpa i varna thu ngai zing zing hlakhai hi an va hamṭha de aw!"
9,"Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness.","LALPA i Pathien, i chunga lâwm êm êm, Israelhai lalṭhungphaa in- ṭhungtirtu che hi inpâkin um raw se; LALPAIN kumkhuoin Israelhai hi a hmangai a, chuleiin, feltaka ro rêl dingin lalah a siem che a ni hi,” a ta."
10,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.","Chun, lal chu rângkachak ta- lent za le sâwmhni le thil riminhnik tamtak el le, lunghluhai a pêk a, Seba lalnuin Solomon thil riminhnik a pêk ang zozaia tam hi a lût ta ngai nawh a."
11,"And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.","Chun, Hiram lawngruol, Ophira inthawka rângkachak va phurtuhai khawm chun Ophira inthawk chun almug thing tamtak le lunghluhai an hung phur a."
12,"And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day.","Chun, lal chun almug thinghai chu LALPA in le lal in inhuonna dingin le hlasaktuhai ta dinga ṭing- ṭang le perkhuonghai siemna ding chenin a hmang a; tu chen hin chuong ang almug thing hrim hrim chu a lûtin hmu khawm hmu a ni ta ngai nawh."
13,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.","Chun, a hni sa naw Solomonin a pêk tihai naw khawm chu lal Solomon chun Seba lalnu chu a dit taphawt, a hni taphawthai chu a pêk a. Chuongchun, a rawihai leh a umna ram tieng chun a fe nâwk tah a."
14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,","Solomon kuoma kum khat sûnga rângkachak lût rikzie chu, rângkachak talent za ruk sâwmruk paruk a nih;"
15,"besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.","sumdâwngtuhaia inthawka sie- chawi lâklût le, thil zawrtuhai suk- hlâwk, Arab lalhai sie-chawi po po le ram awptuhaia inthawka lût tiem loin."
16,And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.,"Chun, lal Solomon chun rângka- chak sut phêkin phaw lien za hni a siem a, phaw pakhat chun shekel za ruk a dit a nih."
17,And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.,"Chun, rângkachak sut phêkin phaw dang za thum a siem a, phaw pakhat chun rângkachak maneh thum pei a ngai a; chuonghai chu lal chun Lebanon rampui ina chun a sieh a."
18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.","Chun, lal chun saiha lal- ṭhungpha ropuitak a siem bawk a, chu chu rângkachak ṭha chi takin ân luon a."
19,"There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.","Lalṭhungpha hang lâwnnaa chun kalbi paruk a um a, chu lal- ṭhungpha hnungtieng chun a hung inkûm a, a ṭhungna sîrtuoka chun a dona a um ve veh a, chun a dona bulhaia chun sakeibaknei pahni an ngîr a."
20,And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.,"Chun, kalbi paruka chun a sîrtuokah sakeibaknei sâwm le pahni an ngîr a, chuong ang chu khâwlai rama khawm an siem ngai hrim hrim nawh a."
21,"And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.","Chun, lal Solomon nohai po po chu rângkachak vawng an na, chun, Lebanon Rampui Ina bûr le bêlhai po po khawm chu rângkachak hlîr hlak vawng an nih; tangkaruo hrim hrim a ṭhang nawh, Solomon dam lai chun, chu chu ieng hûa khawm an ngai nawh."
22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.","Lal chun tuisuorieta chun Hiram lawng ruol inkawppuitu ding Tarsis lawng ruol a nei a, Tarsis lawng ruol chun kum thum dan peiah rângkachak dâm, tangkaruo dâm, saiha dâm, zâwng dâm, ârâwnhai dâm, a hung phur hlak a."
23,So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.,"Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun khawvêla lal po po chu hausaka le vara chun a khûm vawng a nih."
24,"And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.",Pathienin a lungrila varna thu a siepêk chu ngai dingin khawvêla mi po pohai chun Solomon chu an hung pan huoi huoi hlak a.
25,"And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.","Mi tinin lâwmman kum tina pêk bi neiin tangkaraw bûr le bêlhai, rângkachak bûr le bêlhai, puonhai dâm, râlthuomhai dâm, thil rimin- hnikhai dâm, sakawrhai dâm, sa- bengtung lien chi hai dâm an hung pêk hlak a."
26,"And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.","Chun, Solomon chun tawlai- lîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai a ko khâwm ṭeu a, tawlailîr sâng khat le za li le sakawr chung chuong mi sîng khat le sâng hni a nei a, chuonghai chu tawlailîr siena khuo- haia, Jerusalem khuoa lal umnaa dâm chun ân umtir a."
27,"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.","Chun, lal chun Jerusalem khuoa chun a tam êm leiin tangka- ruohai chu lung ang ela ngai khawpin ân umtir a, Sidar thinghai dâm chu phaia theichang thing ang ela ngai khawpin ân umtir a."
28,"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.","Chun, Solomon inei sakawrhai chu Aigupta rama inthawka hung tawl suok an na, chun, lal sumdâwng- tuhai chun aruol ruolin an lo khâr hlak a, aruola inchâwk pei an nih."
29,"And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.","Aigupta rama inthawka taw- lailîr chu tangkaruo shekel za ruk peiin an suktlung hlak a, chun, sakawr chu tangkaruo shekel za le sâwmnga peiin; chuong ang bawk chun Hit mihai lalhai po po le Suria lalhai khawm an suktlung pêk hlak a nih."
