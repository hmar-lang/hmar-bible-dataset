1,"And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.","Chun, ni tamtak hnunga chun, a kum thum kuma chun LAL- PA thu chu Elija kuomah a hung tlung a, “Va fe la, Ahab kuomah vân lang rawh; chuongchun, hnuoi chung- a hin ruo hung insûrtir ka tih,” tiin."
2,And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria.,"Chun, Elija chu Ahab kuoma inlangtir ding chun a fe tah a. Samari rama chun ṭâm chu a nasa hle el a."
3,"And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly:","Chun, Ahab chun Obadia, a insûng tieng hotu chu a ko a, (Obadia chu LALPA ṭi mi tak a na,"
4,"for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)","Jezebelin LALPA zâwlneihai a râwt rak lai khan Obadia chun zâwl- nei za a ṭhuoi a, pûkah sâwmnga peiin a thuphmang a, bei le tuiin a châwm hlak a nih.)"
5,"And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the fountains of water, and unto all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.","Chun, Ahab chun Obadia kuoma chun, “Tuihnâr po po le varuom umna po po va fang ta khai; sakawrhai le sabengtung lien chi hai hi ei sandam theina dingin hlobet dâm ei hmupêk thei el rawi mawh; chuong naw chun chu ranhai hi chân vawng rawi ei tih,” a ta."
6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.","Chuongchun, ram fang suok ding chu an insem a, Ahab chu a khâtin lampui dangah a feh a; Obadia khawm chu a khâtin lampui dangah a feh a."
7,"And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?","Chun, chuonga Obadia a fe lai chun, ngai ta, Elija le chun an intuok a; ama chun a la hriet a; chuongchun, a bawkkhup a, “Nang i ni maw, ka pu Elija?” a ta."
8,"And he answered him, It is I: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.","Ama chun a dawn a, “Nih e, fe ta la, ‘Ngai ta, Elija chu sawtaka sawn a um,’ tiin i lalpa va hril rawh,” a ta."
9,"And he said, Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?","Chun, ama chun, “Thil ieng am ka suksuol a, i siehlaw hi that dinga Ahab kuta pêk i nuom el am a nih a?"
10,"As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.","LALPA i Pathien hringna sâlin ka hril a nih; ka pu hin nangma inzawngtir nawna hnam le ram hrim hrim a nei nawh i sawnnaw, ‘Hitaka hin a um nawh,’ an ti chun, an hmu naw che thuah ram le hnam chu ṭawng ân khâmtir pei a na."
11,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.","Tuhin nangin, ‘Fe la, ngai ta, Elija sawtaka sawn a um ie, tiin i pu va hril rawh,’ i ti el a."
12,"And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.","Ka mâksan phing che hin LALPA thlarauin ka hriet nawnaah la hmang sîng a ti cheh a, chuong- chun, Ahab chu ka va hril a, a hung hmu thei si naw che chun a mi that el ding i sawnnaw; nisienlakhawm, i siehlaw hin ka tleirawla inthawk tah LALPA chu ka ṭi hlak sih a."
13,"Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah’s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?","Jezebelin LALPA zâwlneihai a râwt rak laia ka thil thaw, LALPA zâwlneihai laia mi za, sâwmnga pâwla pûka ka thuphmang a, bei le tuia ka châwmzie kha ka pu hi an hril naw che nîng a ti maw?"
14,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here; and he will slay me.","Tuhin nangin, ‘Fe ta la, ngai ta, Elija chu sawtaka sawn a um ie, tiin i pu va hril rawh,’ i ti el a, mi that ngei a ti le,” a ta."
15,"And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day.","Elija chun, “A hmaa ka ngîrna hlak sipaihai LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, vawisûn hin a kuomah kân lang ngei ding a nih,” a ta."
16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.","Chuongchun, Obadia chu Ahab va be ding chun a fe tah a, a hril a; chun, Ahab chu Elija hmu tum chun a fe tah a."
17,"And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?","Chun, Ahab chun Elija chu a va hmu chun a kuomah, “Nang i ni maw, Israelhai suklungzîngtupa?” a ta."
18,"And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baalim.","Ama chun a dawn a, “Israelhai hi ka suklungzîng nawh ie, nang le i pa sûnghaiin annâwm an suk- lungzîng lem chu. LALPA thupêkhai chu nghatsana, Baalhai i pawm lem tâka hin."
19,"Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebel’s table.","Chuleiin, tuhin Israelhai po po le Baal zâwlnei za li le sâwmnga leh, Asera zâwlnei, Jezebel dawkâna thlaithlêng awt ve hlakhai za li kha ka kuomah Karmel tlângah vân ko khâwmtir rawh,” a ta."
20,"So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.","Chuongchun, Ahab chun Israel thlahai po po lai chun mi a tir a, zâwlneihai chu Karmel tlânga chun a ko khâwm a."
21,"And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long go ye limping between the two sides? if Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.","Chun, Elija chun mipuihai po po chu a va hnai a, “Lung âwpinkaiin ieng chen am in um ding a na? LALPA chu Pathien a ni chun, ama chu zui unla; chun, Baal chu a ni chun ama chu zui ro,” a ta. Mipuihai chun bau khat khawmin an dawn nawh."
22,"Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.","Chuongchun, Elija chun mipui- hai kuoma chun, “LALPA zâwlnei la um chu keima chau hi ka na, Baal zâwlneihai ruok chu mi za li le sâwmnga an nih."
23,"Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.","Chuongchun, bâwngchal pahni mi hung pe hai sienla, anni chun bâwngchal pakhat chu an puol dingin thlang hai sienla, chan nawi hai sienla, thing chungah sie hai sienla, a hnuoia mei sêm loin; chun, keiin bâwngchal pakhat chu buotsai vêng ka ta, thing chunga chun sieng ka ta, mei sêm bîk naw ning ah."
24,"And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.","Chun, nangni chun in pathien hming chu lam unla, kei khawma LALPA hming lam ka ta, chuong- chun, meia hung dawntu Pathien taphawt chu Pathien ni raw se,” a ta. Chun, mi po po chun an dawn a, “Ân dik a nih,” an ti tâwl a."
25,"And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.","Chuongchun, Elija chun Baal zâwlneihai kuoma chun, “Nangnîn bâwngchal pakhat hi in puola dingin thlang unla, buotsai hmasa ro, nangni chu in tam deu hi; in pa- thien hming chu ko unla, amiruok- chu, a hnuoiah mei chu sêm naw ro,” a ta."
26,"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.","Chun, bâwngchal an puol chu an lâk a, an buotsai tah a, “Aw Baal, mi hung dawn raw khai,” tiin zîngkâra inthawka sûn chenin Baal hming chu an ko a. Nisienlakhawm, riva iengkhawm a um dêr nawh a, a dawntu hrim hrim hlak an um bawk nawh. Chun, an maichâm siem vêla chun an inchâwm an inchâwm el a."
27,"And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked.","Chun, sûnlai tak chun Elija chun anni chu tielin, “Khêk inring ta unla, pathien a ni sih a, ân ngaituo hri amanih, annawleh a in hlau a, sukṭhang ding amani khawm nîng a tih,” a ta."
28,"And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.","Chun, inringtak takin an khêk a, an thaw hlak angin chemtê le fei- haiin an thi suok zawt zawt khawpin an inâtin an insun a."
29,"And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.","Chun, nisa a hung inher chun zân tieng inthâwi hun chen ding hin an hril ruol duol duol zing a, nisienlakhawm, râwl riva hrim hrim a um nawh a, dawntu ding hrim hrim amanih, a lo ngaisaktu hrim hrim amani khawm an um bawk nawh a."
30,"And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.","Chuongchun, Elija chun mipui- hai po po kuoma chun, “Mi hung hnai ta u khai,” a ta; chun, mipuihai po po chun an va hnai a. Chun, LALPA maichâm sukchim ta hnung chu a siemṭhah a."
31,"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.","Chun, “I hming chu Israel nîng a tih,” ti lo dawngtu Jakob nauhai hnam zât lung sâwm le pahni Elija chun a lâk a."
32,"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.",Chuong lunghai chun LALPA hmingin maichâm a siem a; maichâm vêl chu bu chi tekhâwng hni inleng ding zet hin a cho khur a.
33,"And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.","Chun, thing chu a hang sep fel a, bâwngchal chu a chan nâwi a, thing chunga chun a sieh a. Chun, “Bêl pali tuiin suksip unla, pumrawhmang thil inhlân le thing hi hung buokkhum ro,” a ta."
34,"And he said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.","Chun, “Hung buokkhum nâwk ro,” a ta. An hang buokkhum nâwk a. Chun, “A vawithumna dingin hung buokkhum nâwk ro,” a ta; chun, a vawithumna ding chun an thaw nâwk a."
35,And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.,"Chun, tui chu maichâm vêla chun a luong ta dum dum a; chun, cho khur chu tuiin a suksip bawk a."
36,"And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.","Chun, zântienga inthâwi hun lai chun zâwlnei Elija chun a va pan hnai a, “Aw LALPA, Abraham hai, Isaak hai, Israel hai Pathien, nang hi Israel rama Pathien i ni le, kei hi i siehlaw ka na, hieng po po hi nangma thua thaw ka ni ti vawisûn hin hre tâwl raw hai se."
37,"Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.","Mi lo ngaipêk la, hieng mipuihai hin nang LALPA hi Pathien i na, an lungrilhai în lettir nâwk tah a ni ti an hriet theina dingin aw LALPA, mi lo ngaipêk rawh,” a ta."
38,"Then the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.","Chuongchun, LALPA mei chu a hung tlah a, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân dâm, thing dâm, pilvut dâm, lung dâm chu a kâng hmang a, cho khur a tui khawm chu a hîp kang ta vawng a."
39,"And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah, he is God.","Chun, mipuihai po poin chu chu an hei hmu chun an bawkkhup a, “LALPA hi a lo nih, Pathien chu, LALPA hi a lo nih, Pathien chu,” an ta."
40,"And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.","Chun, Elija chun an kuomah, “Baal zâwlneihai hi man unla, pakhat khawm insuo naw ro,” a ta. Chun, an man a, Elija chun Kison vadunga chun a ṭhuoi thlâk a, chutaka chun a that tâwl a."
41,"And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.","Chuongchun, Elija chun Ahab kuoma chun, “Hang fe la, fain hang dâwn ta rawh, ruopui sûr ding ri a um a nih ie,” a ta."
42,"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.","Chuongchun, Ahab chu fa le dâwn dingin a hang fe tah a. Chun, Elija chu Karmel tlâng sîp tieng chun a hang feh a; hnuoi tieng a kûn a, a kap kâra chun a hmai a rawl a."
43,"And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.","A siehlaw kuoma chun, “Hang fe la, tuisuoriet tieng hang thlîr ta khai,” a ta. Chun, a hang feh a, a hang thlîr a, “Iengkhawm a um nawh,” a ta. Ama chun, “Fe nâwk rawh, vawi sari chen,” a ta."
44,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Make ready thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.","Chun, a vawi sarinaa chun, “Ngai ta, tuisuorieta inthawkin mi- hriem kut ruol chau hi sûm a lâwn kai nel nel el,” a ta. Ama chun, “Hang fe la, Ahab kuomah, ‘I tawlailîr buotsai la, fe thla ta rawh, ruoin dang rawi a ti che,’ ti rawh,” a ta."
45,"And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:","Chun, sâwt nawtêa chun vân chu thli le sûmin a hung dum ta khup el a, ruopui vânâwn a hung sûr tah a. Chun, Ahab chu tawlailîra chuongin Jezreel khuoah a fe tah a."
46,"and the hand of Jehovah was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.","Chun, LALPA kut chu Elija chunga chun a um a; chuongchun, a dier a kei a, Ahab hmaa chun Jezreel khaw lûtna chenin a tlân tah a."
