1,"The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth;","Upa chun: Nuhmei ṭha thlang le a nauhai kuomah: Titakzetin ka hmangai cheu a nih, kei chau ni loin, thutak chu hre taphawt khawmin an hmangai cheu a nih:"
2,"for the truth’s sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:","Thutak einia um zing, kumkhuo khawma ei kuoma um ding lei hin."
3,"Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.","Pa Pathien le Pa Naupa Isu Krista kuoma inthawkin, lunginsiet- na dâm, zângaina dâm, inremna dâm chu, thutak le hmangainain ei kuomah um a tih."
4,"I rejoice greatly that I have found certain of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.",Pa kuoma inthawka thupêk ei hmu ang khan i nau tuhai amanih thutaka umin ka hmu leiin ka lâwm hle a nih.
5,"And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.","Nuhmei ṭha, i kuoma thupêk thar ziek ang ni loin, a tîra inthawka ei nei ang kha ziek lemin, ei inhma- ngai tuona dingin ka ngên che a nih."
6,"And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.","Chun, hi hi hmangaina a nih, ama thupêk ang peia ei um hi. Thupêk a tîra inthawka in ihriet ang chu hi hi a nih, hmangainaa chun um ro, ti hi."
7,"For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, even they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.","Hlêmtu tamtak — Isu Krista chu tisain a hung ti ṭan nawtuhai kha — khawvêla hin an hung suok ta sih a. Chuong ang mi chu an nih, hlêmtu le Krista kaltu chu."
8,"Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.","Ei thaw suok sahai kha in inhmang nawh a, a man chu a kima in hmu thei lemna dingin invêng ṭha ro."
9,"Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.","Tûkhawm Krista inchûktirna thua um zing loa, khûm chun Pathien a nei nawh. Chu inchûktirna thua um zing ruok chun, ama ngei chun Pa le Naupa a nei kawp a nih."
10,"If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into your house, and give him no greeting:","Tûkhawm, chu inchûktirna thu chu hung chawi loin, in kuomah hung sienla, in inah intlungtir naw unla, ṭawngbau ṭha khawmin inthla naw ro;"
11,for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.,ṭawngbau ṭhaa inthlatu chu a thil suksuola chun a ṭhang ve sih a.
12,"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write them with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.","In kuomah thu tamtak hril ding ka nei leiin lekha le lekhatuiin ziek ka nuom nawh; in lâwm a kim theina dingin, in kuoma hunga, inhmatuoa inbiek ka beisei lem a nih."
13,The children of thine elect sister salute thee.,I zuorpuinu thlang nauhaiin chibai an bûk che.
