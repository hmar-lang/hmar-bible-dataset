1,"Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;","Chun, mipuiin Pathien thu an ngai a, ama an bâwr hut hut laiin, ama chu Gennesaret dîl panga chun a ngîr a."
2,"and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.","Chun, dîl panga chun lawng pahni a um a hmuh a; nisien- lakhawm, nga mantuhai chu an suok a, an lênhai an sâwp a."
3,"And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.","Chuongchun, lawng pakhat Simon ta lema chun a chuong a, a kuomah vapanga inthawka tlâwmtea intâwl lût hret a hnih a. Chun, a ṭhung a, lawnga inthawk chun mipuihai chu ân chûktir tah a."
4,"And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.","Chun, thu hril a ma chun, Simon kuomah, “Li inthûk tieng pan la, nga man dingin, in lênhai dêng rawh,” a ta."
5,"And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets.","Chun, Simonin a kuomah, “In- chûktirtu, inrimtakin zânkhawvârin kan thawh a, iengkhawm kan man nawh a; nisienlakhawm, i thuin lênhai dêng nâwk ka tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
6,"And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking;","Chun, an hei dêng chun nga nasatak an inkhum a, an lênhai chu ân tan ṭhawt ṭhawt a."
7,"and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.","Lawng danga an pâwl umhai chu anni hung ṭhangpui dingin kutin an hui a. Chun, an hung a, lawng pahni chu tlum vâng vâng khawpin an sung sip ve veh a."
8,"But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.","Chun, Simon Peterin chu chu a hmu chun, Isu khûp bulah a bawkkhup a, “Lalpa, mi fe san rawh, mi suol ka ni hi,” a ta."
9,"For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken;",An nga man chu ama le a ruolhai chun mak an ti hleh a.
10,"and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.","Simon ruolhai bawk, Zebedai naupa Jakob le Johan khawmin mak an ti hle bawk a. Chun, Isûn Simon kuomah, “Ṭi naw, tuta hnung chu mihriem man tâng i tih,” a ta."
11,"And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.","Chun, an lawnghai chu vapangah an ṭhuoi kai a, iengkim mâksanin ama an zui tah a."
12,"And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.","Chun, khaw pakhata a um laiin, ngai ta, mi pakhat inphârnain a bâwm hi a um a, ama chun Isu a lo hmuh a, hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a, “Lalpa, i nuom chun i mi sukthieng thei,” a ta, a ngên a."
13,"And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him.","Chun, ama chun a hei ban a, a them a, “Ka nuom ie, hung inthieng ta raw khai,” a ta. Chun, kârloin a phârna chu a hung bo nghâl tah a."
14,"And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","Chun, a kuomah, “Tukhawm hril naw rawh, amiruokchu, thiempu kâwlah vân entir la, i în thienna dingin Mosie ruot angin inhlân rawh, mihai inhriettirna dingin,” a ti tlat a."
15,"But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.","Nisienlakhawm, a chanchin thu chu ân thang nâwk zuol det a; mipui nasatak a thu hre nuom le an natnahai sukdam nuomin an hung inkhâwm a."
16,"But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu thla- lêra dâm atumin a feh a, a ṭawngṭai hlak a."
17,"And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judæa and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.","Chun, chuong lai chun, ni khat chu ân chûktir a. Chun, a kâwlah Pharisaihai le dân hretuhai ṭhungin an um a, chuonghai chu Galili ram le, Judai ram khaw tina inthawk le Jerusalema inthawka hung suok an na; chun mi sukdamna dingin Lalpa thilthawtheina chu a kuomah a um a."
18,"And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.","Chun, ngai ta, khum pumin zeng pakhat an hung zâwn a; a hmaa sie dingin zâwn lût an tum a."
19,"And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus.","Chun, mipui lei chun zâwn lûtna hrim an hmu nawh a, in chungah an hang lâwn a, in chunga inthawkin a laitakah, Isu hmaah, a khum pumin an inkhai thlâktir a."
20,"And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.","Chun, an ringzie chu a lo hmuin, a kuomah, “Mihriem, i suol- hai ngaidam a ni tah ie,” a ta."
21,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?","Chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihai chun, “Pathien hrilsie hi tu am a ni leh? Pathien chau naw chun tuin am suolhai a ngaidam thei a?” tiin an ngaituoh a."
22,"But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts?","Chuongchun, Isûn an ngaituo chu a hriet a, an kuomah, “In lungrilah ieng am in ngaituoh a?"
23,"Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?","‘I suolhai ngaidam a ni tah,’ ti le, ‘Tho la kein fe rawh’ ti hi a ieng am hril a awl lem a?"
24,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house.","Iengkhawm ni sienla khaw- vêlah Mihriem Naupa hin suol ngaidam theina a nei ti in hrietna dingin,” a ta, (zeng kuoma chun) “Tho la, i khum la la, i inah fe rawh ka ti che hi,” a ta."
25,"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.","Chuongchun, an mithmuah a tho nghâl tah a, a zâlna chu a lâk a, Pathien inpâk pum peiin a inah a fe tah a."
26,"And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.","Chun, an rêngin mak an ti hleh a, Pathien an inpâk a, “Vawisûn chu thil maktak ei hmu a nih,” an tih a, an ṭi bêk bêk a."
27,"And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me.","Chun, chuong zoa chun, a suok a, sie chawina hmuna ṭhung, sie- dâwltu pakhat a hming Levi a hmuh a; chun, a kuomah, “Mi hung zui rawh,” a ta."
28,"And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.","Chuongchun, iengkim a mâk- san a, a tho a, a zui tah a."
29,And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them.,"Chun, Levi chun a inah Isu ta dingin ruoi ropuitak a ṭheh a; chuongchun, siedâwltuhai, mi dang- hai leh mi tamtakin anni an awtpui tâwl a."
30,"And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?","Chun, Pharisaihai, an Dân inchûktirtuhai le chun a închûktirhai chungah an chier a, “Ieng dinga siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai lai in fâk a in dâwn am a na?” an tih a."
31,"And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician; but they that are sick.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Mi hrisêlhai chun dâktawr an ngai nawh a, mi hrivawisiehai lemin an ngai a nih."
32,I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.,"Mi feltakhai lam dinga hung ka ni nawh a, mi suolhai lama insimtir dinga hung ka ni lem,” a ta, a dawn a."
33,"And they said unto him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink.","Chun, annîn a kuomah, “Johan inchûktirhaiin bu an nghei rawp a, an ṭawngṭai hlak; Pharisai inchûktirhai khawmin chuong ang bawkin an thaw hlak; nisienlakhawm, i închûk- tirhai hin an fâkin an dâwn hlak,” an ta."
34,"And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?","Isûn an kuomah, “Mo ṭhuoi- tuhai kuoma a pasal ding chu a um sûng po mo ṭhuoituhai chu in inngheitir thei hlak am a nih?"
35,"But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.","Nisienlakhawm, a pasal ding chu an kuoma inthawka ṭhuoi hmang nihai la tlung a ta, chu ni ruok chun la nghei an tih,” a ta."
36,"And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.","Chun, an kuomah tekhithu khawm a hril a; “Tukhawmin puon thar kei thlain puon hlui an phâwk ngai nawh; phâwk ang sienla a thar chun sukthlêr a ta, a thar hlek le a hlui chu inhme bawk naw ni."
37,"And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.","Chun, tukhawmin uoin thar savun uoin peng hluiahai an thun ngai nawh; thun ang sienla, uoin thar chun savun penghai chu mawr kawi a ta, inbuong a ta, savun penghai khawm chu sieng a tih."
38,But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins.,Uoin thar chu savun peng tharahai an thun lem ding a nih.
39,"And no man having drunk old wine desireth new; for he saith, The old is good.","Chun, tukhawmin uoin um sâwt dâwn zoin uoin thar an du ngai nawh; ‘a um sâwt a ṭha lem’ an ti sih a,” a ta."
