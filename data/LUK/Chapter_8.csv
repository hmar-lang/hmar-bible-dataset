1,"And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve,","Chun, a nakie deu chun Isu thu hril le Pathien ram Chanchin Ṭha intlun pei pumin khaw lien le khaw têhai a fang pei a, a kuomah sâwm le pahnihai chu an um a;"
2,"and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,","nuhmei tuhai amanih, khawhri zâwl dam nâwkhai leh, na dam nâwkhai leh, chuong nuhmeihai chu Mari, a sûnga inthawka khawhri pasari suok Magdalin an iti hai,"
3,"and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them of their substance.","Herod sum enkawltu Chuza nu- hmei Joanna hai, Susanna hai, mi dang tamtak leh an nih; chuonghai chun mâni neiin an rawng an bâwlpêk a."
4,"And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable:","Chun, mipui nasatak an hung inkhâwm a, khaw tina mi a kuomah an hungin, tekhithuin thu a hril a."
5,"The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.","“Bu chi thêtu bu chi thê dingin a feh a. Chun, a thê laiin a ṭhen lampui sîrah a tla a, mîn an sir a, chun, vatehaiin an tlân zo tah a."
6,"And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.","Chun, a ṭhen pielthlêng chungah a tlah a; a mâwng phingleh a hnâwng naw leiin a rawp tah a."
7,"And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.","Chun, a ṭhen hlohlingnei lai a tlah a, hlo chun a mâwng ruolpui a, a dîp hmang tah a."
8,"And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.","Chun, a ṭhen hnuoi ṭhaah a tlah a, a hung mâwng a, a lêt zain a ra tah a,” a ta. Chun, chuong thu chu a hril laiin a khêk a, “Tûkhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
9,And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.,"Chun, a închûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Hi tekhithu hi ieng tina am a na?” tiin an indawn a."
10,"And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.","Ama chun, “Pathien ram thurûk chu nangni ihriet chu phal a na, mi dang kuoma ruok chu tekhithu chaua hril a nih; hmu hai sienla khawm, hmu naw an ni theina dingin, nain hrehai sienla khawm a ngaina an hriet thei nawna dingin."
11,Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.,“Tekhithu kha hi hi a nih; Bu chi chu Pathien thu a nih.
12,"And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.","Chun, lampui sîra mi chu thu hre tahai hi an nih; chun, diebol chu a hung a, an awi nawh a, sandam an ni thei nawna dingin an lungrila inthawkin thu a lâkpêk hlak."
13,"And those on the rock are they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.","Chun, pielthlêng chunga mi chu hieng hi an nih; an hriet phingleh thu chu lâwmtaka pawmhai hi; nisien- lakhawm, zung hrim an nei nawh, sâwt nawtê chau an awi a, thlêma an um phaleh an bânsan nâwk hlak."
14,"And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.","Chun, hlohlingnei laia tla chu hieng mi hi an nih; thu an hriet hnunga an fe pei laiin dam sûng khawsak lungkhamnahai, inhawitir- nahai, hausaknahai chun a dîp a, an ra puitling ngainaw a nih."
15,"And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.","Hnuoi ṭhaa mi chu hieng hi an nih; lungril ṭha le felin thu chu an hriet a, an vawn zing a, tuorseltakin an ra hlak."
16,"And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they that enter in may see the light.","“Tukhawmin khâwnvar insitin bêlin an inkhum nawh, khum hnuoia khawm an sie nawh; a lût taphawtin a var an hmu theina dingin a sienaah an sie lem hlak a nih."
17,"For nothing is hid, that shall not be made manifest; nor anything secret, that shall not be known and come to light.","Phuong lo dinga ip iengkhawm a um nawh, hriet naw ding le inlang lo dinga thuphmang iengkhawm a um bawk nawh."
18,"Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath.","Chuongchun, ieng angin am in hriet fimkhur ro; tûkhawm a nei taphawt chu pe sâng an ta, tûkhawm a nei naw taphawt chu a nei suna a ruot khawm chu lâkpêk an tih,” a ta."
19,"And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd.","Chun, a nu le a unauhai chun Isu kuom tieng an hung pan a, nisienlakhawm, mipui lei chun a kuom an hung tlung thei si nawh."
20,"And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.","Chun, “I nu le i unauhai nang hmu ding chein tuola sawn an ngîr zing ie,” tiin an hril a."
21,"But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Hieng Pathien thu hrea zâwmhai hi ka nu le ka unauhai an nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
22,"Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.","Chun, chuong lai chun ni khat chu lawngah a chuong a, a închûktirhai leh; chun, an kuomah, “Dîl râl khingtieng sawn kai ei tiu,” a ta. Chuongchun, lawng chu an sût a, an fe tah a."
23,"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy.","Chun, an fe laiin Isu a lo in innghil a; chun, dîla chun thlipui a hung hrâng a, an lawng chu tuiin a sip vâng vâng a, nasataka ṭitumnaah an um tah a."
24,"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.","Chun, a kuomah an va feh a, an keitho a, “Inchûktirtu, Inchûktirtu, kan bohmang ding a ni hi teh,” an ta. Chun, ama chu a hung har a, thli le tuifâwn chu a hal tah a; chun, a mah a, a re tah a."
25,"And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?","Chun, an kuomah, “In ringna khâwlai am a um a?” a ta. Chun, an ṭih a, mak an ti hleh a, “Hi mipa hi tu am a ni leh? thli le tui chen khawm thu a pêk a, an awi hi,” an inti tâwl a."
26,"And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee.","Chun, Galili ram zâwna Gerasin mihai ram chu an tlung a."
27,"And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in any house, but in the tombs.","Chun, khawmuola a suokin, khuoa mi khawhri iman tûin amanih ân tuokpui a; ina hrim khawm a um nawh a, thlânahai a um lem hlak a."
28,"And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not.","Chun, Isu a hmu phingleh a khêk a, a hmaah a bawkkhup a, râwl inringtakin, “Isu, Pathien Achung- hnungtak Naupa, kei le nang ieng am ei inzâwlna a um a? mi sawisa lul naw rawh, ka ngên che,” a ta."
29,"For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.","(Isûn khawhri inthieng naw chu, chu mipa sûnga inthawka suok dingin thu a lo pêk ta sih a. Chu mipa chu khawhri chun a man rawp hlak a nih; mihaiin khaidiet le kawl an inbuntir hlak a, an vêng zing hlak a; nisienlakhawm, a khuopnahai chu a suktan a, khawhri chun thlalêrahai a hnawt suok hlak)."
30,"And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him.","Chun, Isûn, “I hming ieng am a na?” tiin ân dawn a. Ama chun, “Nuoia,” a ta, (a sûnga khawhri tamtak an lût leiin)."
31,And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.,"Chun, vânsama fe thu an kuoma pe lo dingin Isu kuomah an ngên a."
32,Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.,"Chun, chutaka chun tlângah vawk ruol tamtak an tlah a; chun, a kuomah, vawkhai sûngah lût theina thu an ngên a. Chun, ama chun thu a pêk a."
33,"And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.","Chun, khawhrihai chu chu mipa sûnga inthawk chun an suok a, vawkhai sûnga chun an lût a; chun, vawk ruol chu râwlah an tlân thla hum hum a, dîlah an tlân lût a, tui inhâkin an thi tah a."
34,"And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.","Chun, a vaituhai chun chu thil umzie chu an hmuh a, an tlân a, khuoa le loahai chun an hril a."
35,"And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.","Chun, thil um dân chu en dingin mihai an suok tâwl a; chun, Isu kuom an hung tlung a, khawhri isuoksanpa chu puon sila lungvar pângngai putin, Isu ke bula ṭhung an hung hmuh a; chuongchun, an ṭi tah a."
36,And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.,"Chun, a hretuhai chun khawhri iman a sukdamzie chu chuonghai chu an lo hril a."
37,"And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them; for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.","Chun, a vêl Gerasin mihai rama mi po po chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk leiin, ama chu an kuoma inthawka fe hmang dingin an ngên a; chun, lawngah a chuong a, a kîr nâwk tah a."
38,"But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,","Chun, khawhri isuoksanpa ruok khan chu Isu kuoma um zing a ngên a."
39,"Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn, “I in tieng fe la, Pathienin i ta dinga thil a thawpêk che ropuizie hi va hril rawh,” tiin ân fetir tah a. Chuongchun, a feh a, khawpui sûng po poa chun Isûn a ta dinga thil a thawpêk ropuizie chu a khêkpui tah a."
40,"And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.","Chun, Isu a hung kîr nâwk chun mipuiin ama an lâwm a, ama lo nghâk zinga um an ni tâwl leiin."
41,"And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him to come into his house;","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat a hming Jaira, inkhâwmna in hotu chu a hung a, Isu ke bulah a bawkkhup a, a ina fe dingin a ngên a,"
42,"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.","naunu khât kum sâwmpahni lai ding hi a nei a, ama chu thihmun- suolin a zâl zing leiin. Chun, Isu a fe laiin mipuihaiin an hneng sup sup a."
43,"And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any,","Chun, nuhmei pakhat kum sâwmpahni thipûtin a damnawh a, a sum nei po po dâktawrhai kuomah a sukthâm zo ta sih a, tukhawmin an sukdam thei ta si nawh a;"
44,"came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched.","ama chu a hnungah a hung a, a puon hmawr a them a, kârloin a thipût chu a bo nghâl tah a."
45,"And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush thee.","Chun, Isûn, “A mi them kha tu am a na?” a ta. Chun, “Kei chu ka ni nawh,” an ti seng a. Peter le a ruolhaiin, “Inchûktirtu, mipuihaiin an hneng sup sup cheh a, an bûm tul tul che annâwm,” an ta."
46,"But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.","Nisienlakhawm, “Tûin amanih chu a mi them a nih, thilthawtheina ka sûnga inthawkin a suok nghe nghe ti ka hriet a nih,” a ta."
47,"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.","Chun, nuhmei chun ân thup thei naw a hriet a, inthin pumin a hung a, a hmaah a bawkkhup a, a them san le kârloa a dam tâk elzie chu mi po po hmua chun a hril tah a."
48,"And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ka naunu, i ringna hi i dampui a nih, thlamuongtakin fe rawh,” a ta."
49,"While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.","A la ṭawng zing laiin in- khâwmna in hotu ina inthawk chu mi pakhat a hung a, “I naunu a thi tah, inchûktirtu suksâwl nuom naw,” a ta."
50,"But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.","Isu ruok chun chu thu chu a hriet chun, “Ṭi naw rawh, ring el rawh, chuongchun, dam nâwk a tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
51,"And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother.","Chun, in chu a va tlung chun, Peter hai, Jakob hai, Johan hai, naupang nu le pa chau naw chu tukhawm lût a phal ve nawh a."
52,"And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.","Chun, an rêngin an lo ṭap rak rak a, an âwm an inchum a; chuongchun, ama chun, “Ṭap naw ro, a thi nawh, a in innghil a ni lem,” a ta."
53,"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.","Chun, a thi tain an hriet zing sih a, an nuisan el a."
54,"But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.","Isu ruok chun a kut a chel a, “Bawinu, tho rawh,” a ta, a ko a."
55,"And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that something be given her to eat.","Chun, a thlarau chu a hung kîr nâwk a, a tho nghâl tah a; chun, iengkhat fâk ding pêk ding thu a pêk a."
56,And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.,"Chun, a nu le pa chun mak an ti hleh a; nisienlakhawm, ama chun, a thilthaw chu tukhawm hril lo dingin a ti tlat a."
