1,"And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.","Chun, Isu khâwlai hmuna manih a ṭawngṭai a, a ṭawngṭai zo chun a închûktir mi pakhatin a kuomah, “Lalpa, ṭawngṭai dân Johanin a închûktirhai ân chûktir ang khan mîn chûktir ve ta la,” a ta."
2,"And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “In ṭawngṭai chun hieng ang hin ti ro, ‘Kan Pa, I hming inzaum raw se. I ram hung tlung raw se,"
3,Give us day by day our daily bread.,"Ni tin kan fâk khawpin bu mi pe la,"
4,And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.,"Kan suolhai mi ngaidam la, Keini khawmin kan iengkhat battuhai po po kan ngaidam hlak a nih. Thlêmnaa chun mi ṭhuoi lût naw rawh,’ tiin,” a ta."
5,"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;","Chun, ama bawkin an kuomah, “Nangni laia tûin amanih ruol nei sienla, zânrilah a kuomah fein, ‘Ruola, beiphêk pathum mîn pûktir rawh;"
6,"for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;","ka ruolpa inzinin a mi hung sir a, ama infâktir ding iengkhawm ka nei si nawh,’ ti sienla,"
7,"and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee?","in sûnga mîn, ‘Mi sukbuoi naw, tuhin chu kawt khâr a ni tah a, ka nauhai khawm ka kuomah khumah an zâl tah a, thoin ka va pêk thei naw che,’ tiin dawn sienla."
8,"I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.","Ka ti cheu hi, a ruolpa a ni leiin thoin a va pêk nawa chu, a hni tlut tlut leiin, a dit zât zât va pêng a tih."
9,"And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.","“Chuongchun, ka ti cheu hi, hni ro, chuongchun, pêkin um in tih; zawng ro, chuongchun, hmûng in tih; nawk ro, chuongchun, hawngpêkin um in tih."
10,For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.,"Tûkhawm a hni taphawt chun an hmu hlak; tûkhawm a zawng chun an hmu hlak, tûkhawm a nawk chu hawngpêk ning an tih."
11,"And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent?","Nangni laia pa hi, a naupain beiphêk hni sienla, tûin am lung pêng a ta? anleh, nga hni sienla, tûin am nga aiah rûl pêng a ta?"
12,"Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?","Anleh, ârtui hni sienla, ainuvêt a pêk ding am a nih?"
13,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?","Chuongchun, nangni mi suol hmanin in nauhai thil ṭha pêk na- châng in hriet chun, in Pa vâna mi chun a hnituhai chu Thlarau Inthieng a va pêk âwm ngei deh e!” a ta."
14,"And he was casting out a demon that was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled.","Chun, Isûn khawhri ṭawngthei- naw pakhat a hnawt dawk a. Chun, khawhri chu a suok phingleh ṭawngtheinaw chu a ṭawng tah a; chuongchun, mipuihaiin mak an ti hleh a."
15,"But some of them said, By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.","Nisienlakhawm, a ṭhen chun, “Khawhri lal Beelzebub leiin annâwm khawhrihai a hnawt dawk hlak chu,” an ta."
16,"And others, trying him, sought of him a sign from heaven.","Chun, a ṭhenin ama fiena dingin vâna inthawkin inchikna an hnih a."
17,"But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.","Ama ruok chun, an ngaituohai chu a lo hriet a, an kuomah, “Khâwlai ram khawm mâni le mâni indo taphawt chu an bohmang hlak; sûng khat khawm mâni le mâni indo chu an bohmang hlak."
18,"And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.","Setan khawm ama le ama ân do chun, a ram iengtin am ngîr suok a ta?"
19,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.","Chun, kei Beelzebub leia khawhrihai hnawt dawk hlak ka lo ni chun, in nauhaiin tû leiin am an hnawt dawk hlak a le? Chuleiin, anni chu nangni ngaituotu dinghai nîng an tih."
20,"But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.","Amiruokchu, kei Pathien kut pâr leia khawhrihai hnawt dawk hlak ka ni chun, Pathien ram in kuomah a hung tlung tah nîng a tih."
21,"When the strong man fully armed guardeth his own court, his goods are in peace:","“Mi hrât chun hriem famkim chawia a in a vêng sûng po, a sum chu himtakin a um zing hlak;"
22,"but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.","nisienlakhawm, ama nêka hrât lemin a hung thawh a, a hne pha chun, ân ringna râlthuom famkim chu a lâkpêk a, a râllâk thil chu a sem dar hlak."
23,He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.,"Tûkhawm, keia tienga ṭhang naw chu a mi do a nih; tûkhawm a mi lâk khâwmpui naw chun, a the dar a nih."
24,"The unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and finding none, he saith, I will turn back unto my house whence I came out.","“Khawhri inthieng naw chu mi sûnga inthawka a suokin, châwlna zawngin tui um nawna hmunahai ân vâk a. Châwlna hrim hrim a hmu nawh a, ‘Ka suokna ina khan kîr nâwk el ka tih,’ a ta,"
25,"And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.","chun, a va tlung chun phît faia cheimawiin a va hmuh a."
26,"Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.","Chu phingleh a feh a, ama nêka suol lem khawhri dang pasari a hung ṭhuoi a, chutaka chun an lût a, an um zing hlak a; chu mihriem umzie nuhnung chu a hmasa nêkin a hung ṭha naw lem hlak a nih,” a ta."
27,"And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril laiin, mipui laia nuhmei pakhat a khêk suok a, a kuomah, “Nangma vawnna phîng chu a hamṭha ie, i nêne nêk khawm,” a ta."
28,"But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.","Ama ruok chun, “Anih, nisien- lakhawm, Pathien thu hrea zâwmhai hi mi hamṭha an ni lem,” a ta."
29,"And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah.","Chun, mipuihai chu a kuoma an hung inkhâwm laiin Isûn, “Tulai ruoltharhai hi ruolthar suoltak an nih; inchikna an zawng a; nisien- lakhawm, Jona inchikna chau naw chu an kuomah inchikna hrim hrim pêk ni naw ni."
30,"For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.","Jona chu Ninevi khuoa mihai ta dinga inchikna a lo ni ang khan, Mihriem Naupa khawm tulai ruoltharhai ta ding hin inchikna la nîng a tih."
31,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.","“Simtieng lalnu kha ngaituo pha chun tulai ruoltharhai kuoma hin tho vêng a ta., thiemnaw inchangtir a tih; Solomon var ngai ding hmanin kâwlkawdawnga in- thawkin a hung sih a; ngai ta u, Solomon nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um."
32,"The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.","“Ninevi khuoa mihai chu ngaituo pha chun tulai ruoltharhai lai hin ngîr vêng an ta, thiemnaw inchangtir an tih, Jona thu hril leiin an sim sih a; ngai ta u, Jona nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um annâwm."
33,"No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they which enter in may see the light.","“Tukhawmin khâwnvar an sitin in hnuoi kilah an sie ngai nawh, leikhâwr hnuoiah an sie ngai bawk nawh, mi lûthai chun a var an hmu theina dingin a sienaa chun an sie lem hlak a nih."
34,"The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.","“I taksa khâwnvar chu i mit a nih, i mit a var chun i taksa khawm apumin a var suok hlak; a se ruok chun i taksa khawm ân thim zo vawng hlak."
35,Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness.,"Chuongchun, i sûnga var um chu inthim a lo ni el râwm, fîmkhur rawh."
36,"If therefore thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light.","Chuongchun, i taksa hi khâwlai khawm inthim loa a puma a var suok chun, khâwnvar var nasatakin a el che angin var suok a tih,” a ta."
37,"Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.","Chun, a hril laiin, Pharisai pakhatin ama chu a kuoma bu fa dingin a fiel a; chuongchun, a lût a, buthlêng chu a awt a."
38,"And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner.","Chun, Pharisai chun bu fâk hmaa a kut a sâwp naw chu a hmuin mak a ti hleh a."
39,"And the Lord said unto him, Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.","Chun, Lalpa chun a kuomah, “Nangni Pharisaihaiin no le thlêng puo tieng chu in sâwp fai hlak luoh a; in sûng tieng ruok chu hlêprûkna le suolin a sip sih a."
40,"Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make the inside also?","Mi invêthai, a puo tieng siemtu chun a sûng tieng khawm a siem naw am a nih?"
41,"But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are clean unto you.","Nisienlakhawm, a sûnga thil um chu mi rimsihai kuoma pêk dingin hmang ro; chuongchun, ngai ro, in ta dingin iengkim ân thieng tah a nih."
42,"But woe unto you Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God: but these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.","“Nangni Pharisaihai, in chung a rik ie! Pudina dâm, pardi dâm, thlai tinrêng dâm sâwma pakhat in pêk hlak a, felna le Pathien hmangaina chu in ngaitha hlak sih a. Nisienlakhawm, chuong chu a nih in sawnnaw in thaw ding chu, a danghai chu thaw ṭhul chuong loin."
43,"Woe unto you Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces.",Nangni Pharisaihai in chung a rik ie! Inkhâwmna ina ṭhungpha ṭhatak le dâwrhmuna chibai bûkhai in ngaina si hlak a.
44,"Woe unto you! for ye are as the tombs which appear not, and the men that walk over them know it not.","In chung a rik ie! Thlân ti inhriet lo, a chunga hre loa mi an fe hlakna ang chu in nih,” a ta."
45,"And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, Teacher, in saying this thou reproachest us also.","Chun, Dânhretu pakhatin a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, hieng thu i hril hi keini khawm mi hal i ni hi,” a ta, a dawn a."
46,"And he said, Woe unto you lawyers also! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.","Ama chun, “Dân hretuhai, nangni khawm in chung a rik ie! Thil phur rinumtakhai mihai in bel hlak a, nangni chun phurhai chu in kutpâr pakhat khawmin in them ngai si nawh."
47,"Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.","In chung a rik ie! Zâwlneihai thlân inhai in bâwl hlak a, in thlatuhai ithat an ni sih a."
48,"So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build their tombs.","Chuongchun, in thlatuhai thil- thawhai chu in hrietpuiin in remtipui a nih; annîn an that a, nangnîn an thlân inhai in bâwl sih a."
49,"Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and some of them they shall kill and persecute;","Chuleiin, Pathien varna khawmin, ‘An kuomah zâwlneihai le tirkohai tir ka ta, a ṭhen that an ta, a ṭhen suknawmnâng an tih;"
50,"that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;","zâwlnei po po thisen, leilung insieng tîra inthawka kha tulai ruoltharhai chunga phuba lâk a ni theina dingin."
51,"from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation.","Abel thisen suoka inthawk, Zakaria mâichâm le biekin inkâra thi, thisen suok chena mi kha.’ Anih, ka hril cheu hi, tulai ruoltharhai chunga hin phuba lâng an tih."
52,"Woe unto you lawyers! for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.","Nangni Dân hretuhai, in chung a rik ie! Varna chabi chu in fe hmangpui a; nangni hlak in lût nuom si nawh a, mi lût ding hlak in khap sih a,” a ta."
53,"And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things;","Chun, chutaka inthawka a suok chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihai chun an tai ta rân a, thu tinrêng an inhriltir a;"
54,"laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.",a ṭawng suol hlaua man tumin an inchân zing a.
