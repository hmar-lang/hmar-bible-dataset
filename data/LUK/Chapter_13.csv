1,"Now there were some present at that very season who told him of the Galilæans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.","Chun, chulaitak chun, tuhai amanih an lo um a, anni chun Galili rama mi, Pilatin an thisen an Pathien biekna sathathai laia a ipawlpêkhai chanchin Isu an hril a."
2,"And he answered and said unto them, Think ye that these Galilæans were sinners above all the Galilæans, because they have suffered these things?","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Chu Galili rama mihai chu, chuong ang thil an tuor lei chun Galili rama mi po po nêkin mi suol bîk ni dingin in ring am a nih?"

5,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.","Ni lo e, ka hril cheu hi, nangni khawm in sim naw chun, chuong ang bawk chun bohmang vawng in tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
6,"And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none.","Chun, hi tekhithu hi a hril a, “Tûin amanih a grêp huonah theichang phun pakhat a nei a; chun, a kûnga chun a ra a hung zawng a, pakhat khawm a hmu nawh a."
7,"And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground?","Chuongchun, grêp huon enkawltu kuomah, ‘Ngai rawh, kum thum sûng hin hi theichang kûnga hin a ra ka zawng hlak a, pakhat khawm ka hmu si nawh; phûr rawh; iengdinga hmun hluo saka a um zing am a na?’ a ta."
8,"And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘Pu, tu kum bêk hi um sienla, a vêlin cho ka ta, êkin vur phawt ka tih;"
9,"and if it bear fruit thenceforth, well; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.","chun a hung ra chun ṭhâng a ta, a ra naw ruok chun phûr el rawh,’ a tih a,” a ta."
10,And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.,"Chun, Châwlni chun ama chun inkhâwmna in pakhatah ân chûktir a."
11,"And behold, a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift herself up.","Chun, ngai ta, kum sâwmpariet hrâtnawna khawhri iman nuhmei pakhat a um a; ama chu a kûn zing a, a khât chun a ngîr tlûn thei nawh a."
12,"And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.","Chun, Isûn a hmu phingleh a ko a, a kuomah, “Nuhmei, i hrât nawna chun ân thla ta che,” a ta."
13,"And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.","Chun, a chungah a kut ân nghat a; chuongchun, kârloin a ngîr tlûn nghâl tah a, Pathien ân pâk tah a."
14,"And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath.","Chun, Isûn Châwlniin mi a sukdam leiin inkhâwmna in hotu chu a lunginsen a, mipui chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Mihriem sinthawna ding ni ruk a um annâwm; chu sûng chun hung unla, insukdam ro; Châwlnia hung loin,” a ta."
15,"But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?","Lalpa ruok chun a kuomah, “Nangni vervêkhai, Châwlniin mâni sebâwng amanih, sabengtung ama- nih a bu fâknaa inthawka sûtin, tui dâwn dingin in ṭhuoi dawk seng hlak a ni naw am a nih?"

17,"And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.",Chuong thuhai chu a hril laiin a hmêlmahai po po chu an inzak tah a; mipui ruok chu a thil ropui thaw po po leiin an lâwm vawng a.
18,"He said therefore, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it?","Chuongchun, ama chun, “Pathien ram chu iengang am a na? Ieng le hin am hrilkhîng ka ta?"
19,"It is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof.","Anṭam chi mal khat miin a lâk a, huona a the ang chu a nih; chu chu a hung mâwng a, thing a hung na, chunga vatehai chu a zârahai chun an riek a,” a ta."

25,"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are;","In neitu chu a tho a, kawt a khâr hnung chun, nangnîn tuola ngîrin, ‘Lalpa, kawt mi hawngpêk rawh,’ tia kawtkhâr in hung nawk pha, ama chun, ‘Khâwtieng mi am in na, ka hriet naw cheu,’ tiin dawn a ti cheu."
26,"then shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets;","Chu pha chun nangnîn, ‘I hmuah kan fâkin kan dâwn ta hlak kha, kan kawtthlêrahai khawm în chûktir hlak kha,’ la tîng in tih."
27,"and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.","Chun, ama chun, ‘Ka hril cheu hi, khâwtienga mi am in ni ka hriet nawh; nangni thil suol thaw po pohai, mi fe hmang san vawng ro,’ la tîng a tih."
28,"There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without.","“Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai, zâwlnei po pohai chu Pathien ram sûnga um in hmua, nangni tuola hnawt suok in ni in inhriet pha, chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih."
29,"And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.","Chun, sak le thlang, sim le hmâra inthawkin hung an ta, Pathien ramah hung ṭhung an tih."
30,"And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.","Chun, ngai ta u, a nuhnung- takhai khawm a hmasataka um ding an um a, a hmasatakhai khawm, a nuhnungtaka um ding an um,” a ta."
31,"In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee.","Chuonglai tak chun Pharisai tuhai amanih an hung a, a kuomah, “Suok la, hitaka inthawkin fe hmang rawh; Herodin sukhlum che a nuom bêk bêk a nih,” an ta."
32,"And he said unto them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am perfected.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Chu sihal kuoma chun hi thu hi va hril ro, ‘Ngai rawh, vawisûn le zîngah khawhrihai hnawt dawk ka ta, damnawhai khawm sukdam ka ta, a zîngnâwk zo ka tih.’"
33,Nevertheless I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.,"Ieng khawm ni raw se, vawisûn leh, zînga leh, a zîngnâwk leh ka fe pei ding a nih; Jerusalem khaw puo tieng zâwlnei thi thei a ni nawh ie,” a ta."
34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her own brood under her wings, and ye would not!","“Aw Jerusalem, Jerusalem! zâwlnei thattu, i kuoma an hung tirhai lunga lo dêng hlumtu; ârpuiin a têhai a thla hnuoia a awp khâwm angin, i nauhai vawi iengzât am awp khâwm ka tum kha! Nisienlakhawm, in nuom si nawh."
35,"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.","En ta u, in in chu aruoka mâk- sanpêk cheuin a um tah. Ka hril cheu hi, ‘Lalpa hminga hung chu inpâkin um raw se,’ in ti hmakhat chun, mi hmu nâwk ta naw ti niu,” a ta."
