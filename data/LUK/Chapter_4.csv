1,"And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness","Chun, Isu chu Thlarau Inthiengin a sip a, Jordan vadunga inthawk- in a kîr nâwk a, thlalêrah ni sâwmli Thlarau ṭhuoia umin Diebol thlêmin a um a."
2,"during forty days, being tempted of the devil. And he did eat nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he hungered.","Chun, chuong nihaia chun ieng- khawm a fâk nawh a; chuongchun, a tâwpa chun a phîng a hung ṭâm tah a."
3,"And the devil said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread.","Chun, Diebol chun a kuomah, “Pathien Naupa i ni chun hi lung hi beia inchang dingin thu pe rawh,” a ta."
4,"And Jesus answered unto him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “ ‘Mihriem hi bei chauin hring naw ni hai,’ ti ziek a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
5,"And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.","Diebol chun a ṭhuoi tung a, mit khap kâr loin khawvêl ram po po ân entir a."
6,"And the devil said unto him, To thee will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.","Chun, a kuomah, “Hieng po po chunga thuneina le ropuina hi pêng ka ti che; ka kuomah pêk a ni ta sih a, ka nuom taphawt kuomah ka pêk hlak bawk a nih."
7,"If thou therefore wilt worship before me, it shall all be thine.","Chuongchun, chibai mi bûk la, a rêngin i ta vawng nîng a tih,” a ta."
8,"And Jesus answered and said unto him, It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “ ‘Lalpa i Pathien chibai bûk la, ama rawng chau bâwl rawh,’ ti ziek a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
9,"And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:","Chun, Diebol chun Jerusalemah a ṭhuoi a, Pathien biekin sîp zuma chun a sieh a; a kuomah, “Pathien Naupa i ni chun, hitaka inthawk hin tla thla rawh;"
10,"for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to guard thee:","‘Nangma humhim ding chein A vântirkohai chu thu pêng a tih,’ ti le,"
11,"and, On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.","‘An kutin dawm an ti cheh a, Chuong naw chun i kein lung sui hlau rawi i tih,’ ti ziek a ni sih a,” a ta."
12,"And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “ ‘Lalpa i Pathien infie naw,’ ti a nih,” tiin a dawn a."
13,"And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him for a season.","Chun, Diebolin a thlêmna ding tinrênga a thlêm zo chun, a remchâng phaa dingin a fe san tah a."
14,And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about.,"Chun, Isu chu Thlarau thil- thawtheina putin Galili ramah a fe nâwk tah a; chun, a chanchin chu chu lai vêl ram tina chun ân thang tah a."
15,"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.","Chun, an inkhâwmna inahai ân chûktir pei a, mi po po inpâkin a um a."
16,"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.","Chun, a seilienna khuo Nazareth chu a hung tlung a; Châwl- nia a thaw dân pângngaiin inkhâwm- na inah a lût a, tiem dingin a ngîr a."
17,"And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written,","Chun, zâwlnei Isai lekhabu chu a kuomah an pêk a, Lekhabu ziel chu a sût a, hi thu ziekna lai hi a phar a,"
18,"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor: He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives, And recovering of sight to the blind, To set at liberty them that are bruised,","“Riengvaihai kuoma Chanchin Ṭha hril dinga a mi ruot leiin, Lalpa Thlarau chu ka chungah a um; Ama chun salhai kuoma suokna thu le, Mitdelhai kuoma mitvar nei nâwkna thu hril ding dâm, Suknawmnat tuorhai insuoktirna ding dâm,"
19,To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.,"Lalpa lungawi kum thu hril ding dâmin, A mi tir a nih,” ti hi."
20,"And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.","Chun, lekhabu chu a ziel a, rawngbâwltu a pêk nâwk a, a ṭhung tah a. Chun, inkhâwmna ina mi po po mit chu ama chungah a fuh a."
21,"And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.","Chun, an kuomah, “Hi Pathien Lekha Thu hi vawisûn hin in ihrietah a hung tlung tah,” tiin a hril ṭan a."
22,"And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?","Chun, an rêngin ama an inpâk a, a bausuok lunginsietna thu dâm chu mak an ti hleh a. “Hi pa hi Josef naupa a ni naw am a nih?” an ta."
23,"And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Hi ṭawngbau hi, ‘Dâktawr, nang in- sukdam rawh,’ ‘Kapernauma i thil- thaw kan lo hriet taphawt kha, nangma khuo tieng khawm hin thaw ve rawh,’ tiin in mi la ti ngei âwm de hi,” a ta."
24,"And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.","Chun, ama bawkin, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, zâwlnei tukhawm mâni khuo tieng mîn an lâwm ngai nawh."
25,"But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land;","Chuongchun, indiktakin ka hril cheu, Elija dam laia kum thum le thla ruk vân a ping a, khawvêla ṭâm nasatak a hung tla khan, Israel ramah hmeithai tamtak an um a;"
26,"and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.","nisienlakhawm, anni laia tukhawm kuomah Elija tir a ni nawh a, Sidon ram tienga Sarepta, nuhmei pakhat hmeithai kuoma chau tir a ni lem kha."
27,"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.","Chun, zâwlnei Elisa dam lai khawm khan Israel ramah inphâr tamtak an um a; nisienlakhawm, Naaman Suria rama mi chau naw chu anni laia tukhawm sukthiengin an um naw kha,” a ta."
28,"And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things;","Chun, inkhâwmna ina mi po po chun, chuong thu chu an hriet phingleh an lunginsen ta bêk bêk a,"
29,"and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.","an tho tâwl a, khuoa inthawk chun an nam dawk a, pei thlâk dingin an khuo umna râwl khoa chun an ṭhuoi tah a."
30,But he passing through the midst of them went his way.,"Nisienlakhawm, ama chu an kârah a fe thleng a, a fe ta pei a."
31,"And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day:","Chun, Galili rama khuo pakhat, Kapernauma chun an zu feh a, Châwlni chun mihai ân chûktir a;"
32,and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.,"chun, thuneitaka a hril leiin a thu inchûktir chu mak an ti hleh a."
33,"And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,","Chun, inkhâwmna ina chun khawhri inthieng naw thlarau nei mi pakhat a lo um a; ama chu râwl inringtakin,"
34,"Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.","“A! Nazareth Isu, keini le nang ieng am ei inzâwlna? A mi sukbohmang dingin i hung a ni maw? Nang ka hriet che, Pathien Mi Inthieng i nih,” tiin a khêk suok a."
35,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt.","Chun, Isûn a hal a, “To la, a sûnga inthawkin hung suok rawh,” a ta. Chun, khawhri chun a laiah a sukthlûk zet a, sukna loin a sûnga inthawk chu a hung suok tah a."
36,"And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.","Chun, an rêngin mak an ti hleh a, “Hi hi ieng thu am a ni leh? Thu neitak le thilthawtheitakin khawhri inthieng nawhai thu a pêk a, an suok hi,” tiin an inbiek a."
37,And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about.,"Chun, chu lai ram khaw tinah a chanchin ân thang tah a."
38,"And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s wife’s mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her.","Chun, a tho a, inkhâwmna ina inthawk chu a suok a, Simon inah a lût tah a. Chun, Simon nuhmei nu chu nasatakin a khuo a sik a, chuong- chun, a ta dingin an lo ngênpêk a."
39,"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them.","Chun, a kâwlah a ngîr a, khawsik chu a hal a, a bo tah a; chun, a tho nghâl tah a, an rawng a bâwlpêk a."
40,"And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.","Chun, nisa tlâk ding laiin natna tum tuma na, damnaw nei taphawtin a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; chun, an rênga chunga chun kut ân nghat seng a, a sukdam ta pei a."
41,"And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.","Chun, khawhrihai khawm, “Pathien Naupa i nih,” tia khêkin, mi tamtak sûnga inthawkin an hung suok a. Chun, anni a hal a, Krista a nih ti an hriet leiin an ṭawng a phal nawh a."
42,"And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them.","Chun, khawvar phingleh a suok a, thlalêr hmunah a feh a; chun, mipuihai chun an zawng a, a kuomah an hung a, anni a fe san nawna dingin chel an tum a."
43,"But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “Khaw dangahai khawm Pathien ram Chanchin Ṭha ka hril ding a nih, chu lei tak chun tir ka ni sih a,” a ta."
44,And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.,"Chuongchun, Judai rama in- khâwmna inahai thu a hril a."
