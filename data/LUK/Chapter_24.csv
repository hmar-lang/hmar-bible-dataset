4,"And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:","Chun, chuong leia an lunginzîng lai chun, ngai ta, mi pahni puon mi elkhal thei silin an kâwlah an hung ngîr a;"
5,"and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?","chun, an ṭih a, an hmaia hnuoi an sik el lai chun, anni chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga mithi laia mi dâm in zawng am?"

7,"saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.","‘Mihriem Naupa hi mi suolhai kuta inmantirin um a ta, krawsah hemdêng an ta, ni thum ni chun a tho nâwk ding a nih,’ a ti kha,” an ta."
8,"And they remembered his words,","Chun, a thu hrilhai chu an hriet suok tah a,"
9,"and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.","thlâna inthawk chun an fe nâwk tah a, sâwm le pakhathai kuoma le mi po po kuomah chuong thil po po chu an hril tah a."
10,"Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.","(Chuong nuhmeihai chu Mag- dalin Mari hai, Joanna hai, Jakob nu Mari hai an nih; an kuoma nuhmei danghai khawmin tirkohai kuoma chun chuong thu chu an hril bawk a."

12,"But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.","[Nisienlakhawm, Peter chu a tho a, thlâna chun a tlân tah a; chun, a kûn a, a bih a; puon zai inhmi umhai chu a hmuh a; chuongchun, thil umzie chu mak titakin in tieng a fe nâwk tah a.]"
13,"And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.","Chun, ngai ta, chu ni tak chun anni laia mi pahni chu khaw pakhat Emmau an tia chun an fe ding a na, chu chu Jerusalema inthawkin fing sâwmruk a nih."
14,And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.,"Chun, thil hung tlung po po chu an hril malam pei a."
15,"And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.","Chun, an hohlima an hril tlâng lai chun Isu ngeiin a hung pan a, ân tlawnpui tah a."
16,But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.,"Nisienlakhawm, ama chu an hriet thei nawna dingin an mit chu sukvaiin a um a."
17,"And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.","Chun, an kuomah, “Fe malama in thu hril kha ieng am a na?” a ta. Chun, nguitakin an ngîr tah a."
18,"And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?","Chun, a hming Kleopa lem chun a kuomah, “Jerusalemah makhât chauin amanih i um? Tulaia thil umzie i hriet nawh a,” a ta, a dawn a."
19,"And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ieng thil am ie?” a ta. Anni chun a kuom- ah, “Nazareth Isu, Pathien le mi po po mithmua, a thu le a thilthaw zâwlnei hminginthang tak chanchin thu;"
20,"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.","thiempu lalhai le kan hotuhaiin that thu pêk dingin an ṭhuoi a, krawsa an hemdezie dâm thu kha."
21,"But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.",Keiniin Israel intlantu ding a ni kan beisei vei leh; chuong ta nêk hmanin chuong thil tlungna chen chu vawisûn leh ni thum a ni tah.
22,"Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;","Chuong naw khawm chu kan pâwlhai nuhmei ṭhenkhat, zîngkâr a thlânah an va feh a, an mi hung suklungzîng rak a;"
23,"and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.","a ruong hmu si loin, ‘Pathien vântirkohai inlâr kan hmuh a, chuhai chun a hring nâwk tah ti an hril,’ an hung tih a."
24,"And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.","Chun, kan umpui laia ṭhenkhat thlâna chun an feh a, nuhmeihai hril ang ngeiin an hmuh a, nisien- lakhawm, ama chu an hmu si nawh a,” an ta."
25,"And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Mi invêthai, zâwlneihai thu hril po po awi kawnga ngawnghai!"
26,"Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?",Kristain chuong thil chu tuorin a ropuinaah a lût ding a ni hrim naw am a nih?” a ta.
27,"And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.","Chun, Mosie le zâwlneihai po po lekhaah a phut a, Pathien Lekha po poa ama chanchin ziek taphawt chu anni a hrilfie pei a."
28,"And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.","Chun, an fena ding khuo chu an hung hnai tah a; chun, ama chu hla deua fe tum angin a um a."
29,"And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.","Chun, ṭawngbauin an chel a, “Kan kuomah um ta la; khuo ân hnu ding an ta hi, nisa khawm a tla ding a ni ta hi,” an ta. Chuongchun, an kuoma um dingin a lût tah a."
30,"And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking it he gave to them.","Chun, an kuoma buthlêng awta a ṭhung laiin bei a lâk a, mal a sâwm a, a khawi a, an kuomah a pêk a."
31,"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.","Chun, an mit a hung var a, a hmêl an hung hriet tah a; chun, ama chu a bo el tah a."
32,"And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?","chun, anni chun, “Lampuia a mi biek laia Pathien Lekha Thuhai a mi hrilfie lai khan ei lungril a har huoi hrim naw am a ni kha?” an in tih a."
33,"And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,","Chun, an tho nghâl tah a, Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a, sâwm le pakhathai le an ruolhai um khâwm chu an hmuh a,"
34,"saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.","“Lalpa chu a lo thonâwk takzet a nih; Simon kuoma khawm ân lâr tah,” an lo tih a."
35,"And they rehearsed the things that happened in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.","Chun, anni khawmin lampuia thil hung tlung le, bei a khawia, a hmêl an hung hrietziehai chu an hril veh a."
36,"And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.","Chun, chuong thu chu an hril laiin ama ngei chu anni lai a hung ngîr a, [an kuomah, “In chungah thlamuongna um raw se,” a ta.]"
37,"But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.","Nisienlakhawm, râpthlâk an ti bêk bêk a, an ṭih a, thlarau hmuah an inruot a."
38,"And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga in lunginzîng am? Ieng- dinga in lungrila ringhlâna a hung um am?"
39,"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.","Ka kuthai, ka kephahai hi en ro; hi keima ngei kha ka ni hi! Mi them unla en ro; in mi hmu ang hin chu thlarau chun taksa le ru a nei ve nawh,” a ta."
40,"And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.","[Chun, chu chu a hril zoin a kuthai, a kephahai an kuomah ân entir a.]"
41,"And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?","Chun, an lâwm taluo leiin an la awi naw ta rawp a; mak an ti sûngin an kuomah, “Hitaka hin iengkhat fâk ding in nei am?” a ta."
42,And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.,"Chun, nga raw tlin khat an pêk a."
43,"And he took it, and ate before them.","Chun, a lâk a, an hmaa chun a fâk tah a."
44,"And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.","Chun, an kuomah, “Hieng hi ka thu kha a nih, Mosie Dâna hai, Zâwlnei Lekhabua hai, Inpâkna Hla bua hai ka chanchin ziek taphawt chu a hung tlung dingzie in kuoma ka um laia ka hril hlak cheu kha,” a ta."
45,"Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;","Chuongchun, Pathien Lekha Thu hrietna dingin an lungvar a sukvar tah a,"
46,"and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;","chun, an kuomah, “Hieng ang hin ziek a nih, ‘Krista chun rinum tuor a ta, ni thum niin mithi laia inthawkin thonâwk a tih,"
47,"and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.","ama hmingin simna thu le suol ngaidamna thu Jerusalema inthawk- in hnam tin kuoma hril nîng a tih,’ tiin."
48,Ye are witnesses of these things.,Chuong thil po po chu a hrepui- tu in nih.
49,"And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.","Chun, ngai ta u, ka Pa thil tiem chu in chungah ka hung tir ding a nih; nisienlakhawm, chung tienga inthawka thilthawtheinaa inthuom in ni hmakhat chu khawpuia hin um zing ro,” a ta."
50,"And he led them out until they were over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.","Chun, Bethani khaw kâwl chenin anni a ṭhuoi a; chun, a bân a phar a, mal a sâwmpêk a."
51,"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.","Chun, mal a sâwmpêk lai takin anni chu a mâksan a, [vâna zuk ṭhuoiin a um tah a.]"
52,"And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:","Chun, [chibai an bûk a,] lâwm bêk bêkin Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a;"
53,"and were continually in the temple, blessing God.","chun, Pathien biekina chun Pathien inpâkin an um rawp hlak."
