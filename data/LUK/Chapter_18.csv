1,"And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;","Chun, beidawng loin an ṭawngṭai rawp ding a nih ti, inhriettirna dingin an kuomah tekhithu a hril a;"
2,"saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, and regarded not man:","“Khaw ienga manih rorêltu pakhat a um a; ama chun Pathien a ṭi nawh a, mihriem hlak a ngaisak bawk nawh."
3,"and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.","Chun, chu khuoa chun hmeithai pakhat a um a; ama chun, ‘Ka khingpui chungah ka phuba mi lapêk rawh,’ tiin a kuomah a fê rawp a."
4,"And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;","Chun, ama chu sâwt rei chu a nuom nawh a; nisienlakhawm, nakie chun a lungrilin, ‘Pathien ṭi loin mihriem ngaisak naw lang khawm,"
5,"yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming.","hi hmeithai hin a mi sukbuoi leiin a phuba chu lapêk el ka tih; chuong naw chun, a hung rawp hin mi la suksâwl zêk rawi a tih,’ a tih a,” a ta."
6,"And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge saith.","Chun, Lalpa bawkin, “Rorêltu fel naw thu hril chu hre ro."
7,"And shall not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and yet he is longsuffering over them?","An chungah zai la daw hri sien khawm, a mi thlang, asûn azâna ama kotuhai phuba chu Pathienin a lâkpêk naw ding am a nih?"
8,"I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?","Ka hril cheu hi, an phuba chu lapêk vak a tih. Nisienlakhawm, Mihriem Naupa hi a hung pha chun khawvêlah ringna a hung hmu ding am a nih?” a ta."
9,"And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought:","Chun, mi feltak ni inringa, mi dang po po hmusit hlak, tuhai amani kuoma khawm chun hi tekhithu hi a hril a:"
10,"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.","“Mi pahni Pathien biekinah ṭawngṭai dingin an hang feh a; pakhat chu Pharisai a na, pakhat chu siedâwltu a nih."
11,"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.","Pharisai chu a ngîr a, ama khât chauin hieng ang hin a ṭawngṭai a, ‘Pathien, mi dang hlêpruhai, fel nawhai, uirehai ang ka ni naw lei le, hi siedâwltu ang khawm hi ka ni naw leiin i chungah ka lâwm ie."
12,I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.,"Châwlkâr khatah vawi hni bu ka nghei hlak a; ka nei taphawt sâwmah pakhat ka pêk hlak,’ a ta."
13,"But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinner.","Siedâwltu ruok chu hlatakah a ngîr a, vân tieng khawm a dâk ngam nawh a, ‘Pathien, kei mi suol hi mi lunginsiet rawh,’ tiin a âwm ân chum ân chum ta lem a."
14,"I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.","Ka hril cheu hi, a hmasa nêkin ama lem chu thiem changin a inah a fe thla ta lem a. Inngaihlu taphawt tlâwm an ta, inngaitlâwm taphawt chu chawimawiin um an tih,” a ta."
15,"And they were bringing unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.","Chun, a them dingin a kuomah an nautêhai an hung ṭhuoi a; inchûktirhai ruok chun chu chu an hmu phingleh an lo hal a."
16,"But Jesus called them unto him, saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.","Nisienlakhawm, Isu chun a ko a, “Naupangtêhai ka kuomah inhung- tir unla, khap naw ro; Pathien ram chu hieng ang mihai ta a ni sih a."
17,"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm Pathien ram chu nau- pangtêin a lâwm anga lâwm naw phawt chu a sûngah lût naw tawp an tih,” a ta."
18,"And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?","Chun, hotu tûin amanih a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu ṭha, chatuona hringna ka nei theina dingin ieng am thâwng ka ta?” a ta."
19,"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, even God.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Ieng- dinga ṭha i mi ti? mi pakhat chau naw chu tûkhawm ṭha an um nawh, chu chu Pathien a nih."
20,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother.","Thupêkhai chu i hriet an- nâwm ‘Uire naw, tuol that naw, inru naw, hrietpuina inkhêl pe naw, i nu le pa chawimawi rawh,’ tihai hi,” a ta."
21,"And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up.","Chun, ama chun, “Chuong thu po po chu naupangte ka ni laia inthawkin ka zâwm pei hlak,” a ta."
22,"And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.","Chun, Isûn chu chu a hrietin a kuomah, “Tu khawm hin kawng khat i la bâk ie; i nei po po zawr la, pasiehai kuomah sem rawh, chuongchun, vânah ro nei i tih; chun, hung la, mi hung zui rawh,” a ta."
23,"But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich.","Ama ruok chu chuong thu chu a hrietin a lungngai bêk bêk a, a hausak bêk leiin."
24,"And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!","Chuongchun, Isûn ama chu a en a, “Sum hauhai chu Pathien rama lût a vân tak âwm deh aw!"
25,"For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","Mi hausa Pathien rama lût nêkin sanghâwngsei ṭhimnaah lût thleng a awl lem a nih,” a ta."
26,"And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved?","Chun, chu thu hrehai chun, “Anleh, tu am sandam ni thei a ta?” an ta."
27,"But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.","Ama ruok chun, “Mihriem thaw ruollo hi Pathien thaw thei a nih,” a ta."
28,"And Peter said, Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee.","Chun, Peterin, “Ngai ta, keinîn kan in le lo mâksanin kan zui cheh a!” a ta."
29,"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm Pathien ram leia in amanih, nuhmei amanih, unauhai amanih, nu le pa amanih, nauhai amanih mâksan taphawt chu,"
30,"who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.","hi dam sûng ngei khawm hin a nêka tam lem hmu naw ding tûkhawm an um nawh, hun la hung tlung dinga chatuona hringna leh,” a ta."
31,"And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man.","Chun, sâwm le pahnihai chu a kuomah a tumin a ṭhuoi a, an kuomah, “ngai ta u, Jerusalemah ei hang fe ding a ni hi; zâwlneihai thu ziek po po kha Mihriem Naupa chunga hin tlung a tih."
32,"For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon:","Jentailhai kuomah pêng an ta, nuiza siemna dingin hmang an tih, inzakumtakin siem an ta, chil sâkkhum an ta,"
33,and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.,"chun, vuong an ta, sukhlum an tih; chun, ni thum niin tho nâwk a tih,” a ta."
34,"And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.","Chun, chuong thu hrim hrim chu a ngaina an hriet nawh a; thu hril chu anni ta dingin thupin a um a, ieng hril am a ni khawm an hriet nawh."
35,"And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:","Chun, Jeriko a tlung tâwmin mitdel tu amanih lampui sîrah kut dawin a lo ṭhung a;"
36,"and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.","ama chun mipui fe ri chu a hriet a, iengtizie am a ni taa ti ân dawn a."
37,"And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.","Chun, anni chun Nazareth Isu a fe a nih ti an hril a."
38,"And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.","Chuongchun, ama chu, “Isu David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin a khêk a."
39,"And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.","Chun, a hmasahai chun to dingin an hal a; nisienlakhawm, ama chu, “David Naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin a khêk zuol det a."
40,"And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,","Chuongchun, Isu a ngir a, a kuoma hung ṭhuoi dingin thu a pêk a;"
41,"What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.","chun, a kâwl a hung tlung chun, “I chungah ieng ang am ka thaw i nuom a?” a ta, a lo indawn a. Chun, ama chun, “Lalpa, hmu thei ka nuom,” a ta."
42,"And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Hmu thei ta raw khai, i ringna hi i dampui a nih,” a ta."
43,"And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.","Chun, kârloin a hmu thei nghâl tah a, Pathien inpâk pum peiin ama chu a zui tah a; chun, mi po po chun, chu chu an hmu chun Pathien an inpâk a."
