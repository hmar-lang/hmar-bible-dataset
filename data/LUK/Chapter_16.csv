1,"And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods.","Chun, Isûn a inchûktirhai kuomah hi thu khawm hi a hril a; “Mi hausa tuin amanih sum enkawltu a nei a; chu pa chun a sum a sukthâmpêk mei mei chungah a kuomah an hêk a."
2,"And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward.","Chuongchun, ama chu a ko a, a kuomah, ‘I chungchâng thu ka hriet hi iengtizie am a na? I sum enkawl chanchin hung ziek vawng rawh; tuta hnung chu sum enkawltu hin ṭhang thei ta naw ti ni,’ a ta."
3,"And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.","“Chun, sum enkawltu chun, a lungrilin, ‘Ka puin ka sum enkawl a mi bân ding hi iengtin am thâw tâng ka ti aw? hnuoi cho ka pei si nawh a, kut daw hlak chu kân zak sih a."
4,"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.","Sum enkawl a mi bân phaa mîn an ina an mîn umtirna dingin ka thaw dân ding ka hriet tah,’ a ta."
5,"And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?","Chuongchun, a pu sum battuhai chu a ko seng a, a hmasatak kuoma chun, ‘Ka pu kuomah iengzât am i bat a?’ a ta."
6,"And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.","Ama chun, ‘Hriek tekhâwng za khat,’ a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘I lekha la la, ṭhung vat la, sâwmnga ziek rawh,’ a ta."
7,"Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.","Chun, mi dang kuomah, ‘Nang iengzât am i bat a?’ a ta. Ama chun, ‘Bu tekhâwng za khat,’ a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘I lekha la la, sâwmriet ziek rawh,’ a ta."
8,And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.,"Chun, a pu chun, sum enkawltu fel naw chu a rem hriet leiin ân pâk tah a; var nauhai nêkin khawvêl nauhai hi an tulai dâna hin an var lem a nih."
9,"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.","“Ka hril cheu hi, sum tehlêmin in ta dingin ruolhai siem ro; sum a bohmang pha leh chatuona umnaa chun inumtira in umna dingin."
10,He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.,"Tukhawm tlâwmte chunga ringum chu tamtak chunga khawm ring a um hlak. Tukhawm, tlâwmte chunga ringum naw chu tamtak chunga khawm ring a um nawh."
11,"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?","Sum tehlêm chunga hman ring in um naw chun, tûin am sum tak chu inkawltir a ti cheu a?"
12,"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?","Mi dang ta chunga hman ring in lo um ta naw chun, nangni ta ding chu tûin am pêng an ti cheu a?"
13,"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","Siehlaw tukhawmin hotu pahni rawng a bâwl kawp thei nawh; pakhat chu theidain pakhat chu dit a tih, annawleh, pakhat ṭanin pakhat hmusit a tih. Pathien le sum rawng in bâwl kawp thei nawh,” a ta."
14,"And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.","Chun, Pharisai tangka ngaina- tuhai chun chuong thu chu an hriet a, an nuisan a."
15,"And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.","Chuongchun, ama chun an kuomah, “Mi mithmua insukfel el in nih, nisienlakhawm, Pathienin in lungril a hriet sih a; mihriem laia an ichawimawi chu Pathien mithmua chun tirdakumtak a nih."
16,"The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.","Dân le zâwlneihai thu chu Johan hung um chen khan a um a; chu chena inthawk chun Pathien ram Chanchin Ṭha hi an hril a, mi tin an lût hrâm seng a,"
17,"But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.","nisienlakhawm, Dân thu sun- hâng chîterek khawm a bo nêk chun vân le khawvêl bohmang a awl lem a nih."
18,"Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.","“Tûkhawm nuhmei maa, nuhmei dang nei taphawt chu a uire a nih; tûkhawm mi nuhmei mâk nei taphawt chu a uire a nih."
19,"Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:","“Chun, mi hausa tû amanih a um a, puon senduk le puon zai inhmitak a sil a, ni tin inhawitirtakin a um hlak a."
20,"and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,","Chun, a hming Lazar, kutdaw pakhat pânna ibâwm sip, a kawtkhâr bulah an inzâltir hlak a,"
21,"and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores.",mi hausa dawkâna a fâk nawi tla chu fâk a nuom a; uihai hlak chun a pânna chu an liekpêk hlak a.
22,"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.","Chun, hieng ang hi a na, kutdaw chu a thi a, vântirkohaiin an fepui a, Abraham ângsûngah an sieh a. Mi hausa khawm chu a thi a, phûmin a um tah a."
23,"And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.","Chun, mithi khuoa chun natak tuorin a um a, a hang dâk a, hlataka Abraham, a ângsûnga Lazar um leh a hmu tah a."
24,"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.","Chun, a khêk a, ‘Pa Abraham, mi lunginsiet la, Lazar kha hung tir rawh, a kutpâr tuiah inchie sien- la; ka lei sukdeina dingin; hi meichawka hin ka na bêk bêk el,’ a ta."
25,"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish.","“Nisienlakhawm, Abrahamin, ‘Ka naupa, i dam lai khan thil ṭha i hmuh a, chuong ang bawkin Lazarin thil ṭha naw a hmu kha hre zing ta la; nisienlakhawm, ama chu tuhin hitaka hin thlamuongtakin a um a, nang chu i na a ni kha."
26,"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.","Hieng naw khawm hi, hitaka inthawka nangni kuoma fe tumhai chu an fe thei nawna dingin le, tu- khawm khataka inthawka keini kuom tieng an hung kai thei nawna dingin, keini le nangni inkâra hin hnuoi kak nasatak an siem tlat a nih,’ a ta."
27,"And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house;","“Chun, ama chun, ‘Anleh, pa, ama chu ka pa ina bêk infetir dingin ka ngên che;"
28,"for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.","piengpui pasal panga ka nei sih a; hi na umnaa hin hung ve rawi an tih, ṭhahnemngaitakin hril raw se,’ a ta."
29,"But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.","Abraham ruok chun, ‘Mosie le zâwlneihai an nei annâwm; chuhai thu chu ngai raw hai se,’ a ta."
30,"And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.","Chun, ama chun, ‘Pa Abraham, ni lo e, mithi laia mi meu an kuomah fe sienla, sim an tih,’ a ta."
31,"And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘Mosie le zâwlneihai thu an awi naw chun, mithi laia mi tho nâwk sienla khawm awi chuong naw ni hai,’ a tih a,” a ta."
