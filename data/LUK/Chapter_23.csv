1,"And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.","Chun, a pung khâwmhai po po chu an tho a, Isu chu Pilat kuomah an ṭhuoi tah a."
2,"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.","Chun, “Hi mipa hin kan chihai a sukkhawhlo a, Kaisar kuomah sie chawi a khap bawk a, Krista, lal ân ti khawm kan hriet,” tiin an hêk a."
3,"And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.","Chun, Pilatin a kuomah, “Judahai lal i ni maw?” tiin ân dawn a. Ama chun a kuomah, “I hril angin ka nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
4,"And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.","Chun, Pilatin thiempu lalhai le mipuihai kuoma chun, “Hi mipa chunga hin iengkhawm suol ka hmu nawh ie,” a ta."
5,"But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judæa, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun, “Galili ramah a phut a, hi hmun chen hin, Judai ram khaw tina inchûk- tirin, mi po po a chawk- buoi hlak a nih,” tîn an thaw nâwk zuol a."
6,"But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilæan.","Chun, Pilatin chu chu a hrietin, ama chu Galili rama mi a ni le ni naw ân dawn a."
7,"And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.","Chun, Herod biela mi a nih ti a hriet phingleh, Herod kuomah a tir tah a; chuong lai chun ama khawm Jerusalemah a um bawk a."
8,"Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.","Chun, Herodin Isu a hmu chun a lâwm bêk bêk a; a chanchin a hriet leiin inhmaa inthawkin hmu a nuom a."
9,And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.,"Chun, thu tamtak ân dawn a, iengkhawmin a dawn si nawh a."
10,"And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chun ngîrin nasatakin an hêk an hêk a."
11,"And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.","Chun, Herod le a sipaihai chun Isu an suknawmna a, an nuisaw a; chun, puon ropuitak insiltirin Pilat kuomah a tir nâwk tah a."
12,And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.,Chu ni tak chun Herod le Pilat chu an inngei tah a; chu hma po chu an intai hlak a.
13,"And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,","Chun, Pilatin thiempu lalhai, hotuhai, mi po pohai a ko khâwm a,"
14,"and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:","an kuomah, “ ‘Mihai a suk- khawhlo,’ tiin hi mipa hi ka kuomah in hung ṭhuoi kha a na; chun, ngai ro, in hma ngeiah ka suosal a, in hêkna thua khan hi mipa chunga hin iengkhawm suol ka hmu naw a nih;"
15,"no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.","Herod khawmin a hmu bawk nawh; ei kuomah a hung tir nâwk el a ni hi; ngai ro, thina khawp meuin iengkhawm a thaw nawh ie."
16,"I will therefore chastise him, and release him.","Vuong ka ta, kân suo nâwk el ding a nih,” a ta."
17,,[Chun ruoiṭhe ni chun mi intâng pakhat ân suopêk ngei dân a na.]
18,"But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:—","Nisienlakhawm, inruoltakin an khêk a, “Hi mipa hi chu sukbohmang la, Barabba kha mîn suopêk lem rawh,” an ta."
19,"one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.",(Chu mipa chu khawpuia helna ieng amanih lei le tuol a that leiin intângna ina intâng a nih).
20,"And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;","Pilat ruok chun Isu insuoktir a nuom a, an kuomah thu a hril nâwk a;"
21,"but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.","nisienlakhawm, an khêk a, “Krawsah hemde rawh, krawsah hemde rawh,” an ta."
22,"And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.","Chun, ama chun a vawi thumnaah an kuomah, “Ieng dingin am ie? Hi mipa hin ieng am a suksuol a? Thina khawp meu, a chungah iengkhawm ka hmu nawh; vuong ka ta, kân suo el ding a nih,” a ta."
23,"But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.","Anni ruok chun inringtakin krawsa hemde dingin an ngên ṭal a. Chun, an râwl chun a vau dei tah a."
24,And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.,"Chun, Pilat chun an ngên anga thaw dingin thu a sukthlûk tah a."
25,"And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.","Helna le tuolthat leia intângna ina intâng an ihni kha ân suoh a, Isu ruok chu an nuom nuoma an thaw dingin a pêk tah a."
26,"And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.","Chun, an ṭhuoi hmang laiin Simon, Kurinia mi, rama inthawka hung an man a. Isu hnung tienga put dingin a chungah kraws chu an innghat a."
27,"And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.","Chun, mipui le nuhmei âwm inchum inchuma ṭap ṭaphai, mipui nasatakin an zui a."
28,"But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.","Isu ruok chun anni tieng a ngha a, “Jerusalem naunuhai, mi ṭa naw ro, nangni le in nauhai ta dingin ṭap lem ro."
29,"For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.","Ngai ta u, a ni la hung tlung a tih, chuong nia chun, ‘Nuhmei chinghai, nau vawn ngai nawna phînghai, nau nêk ngai naw nênehai chu an hamṭha ie,’ la tîng an tih."
30,"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.","Chu pha chun mihaiin tlâng kâwla dâm, ‘Mi del rawh,’ la tîng an ta; muol kâwla dâm, ‘Mîn khum rawh,’ la tîng an tih."
31,"For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?","Thing hringa hman hieng ang an thaw chun, a ṭâwla chun iengtin takin am an thaw ding chu?” a ta."
32,"And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.","Chun, a kuomah mi dang pahni, mi suol, sukhlum dingin an ṭhuoi veh a."
33,"And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.","Chun, “Luru” an ti hmun chu an tlungin, chutaka chun krawsah an hemdeh a, mi suolhai leh, a chang- tieng pakhat, a vawitieng pakhat."
34,"And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.","Chun, Isûn, “Pa, anni hi ngaidam rawh, an thilthaw hi an hriet naw a ni hi,” a ta. Chun, a silfênhai chu an insemin ai an sân a."
35,"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.","Chun, mipuihai chun ngîrin an thlîr a. Chun, hotuhai khawmin, “Mi dang hman a sukdam hlak annâwm; Pathien ithlang Krista a ni zet chun ama le ama insukdam ta sienla,” tiin an ti-el a."
36,"And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,","Chun, sipaihai khawmin ama chu an nuisaw a, a kuomah an hung a, zu thûr an pêk a,"
37,"and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.","“Judahai lal i ni tak zet chun insukdam rawh,” an ta."
38,"And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.","Chun, a chung tienga chun, “HI MIPA HI JUDAHAI LAL A NIH” ti lekha ziek a um a."
39,"And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.","Chun, an mi suol khai pakhat chun Isu a hal a, “Krista chu i ni naw am a nih? Insukdam la, keini khawm mi sukdam ta la,” a ta."
40,"But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?","Nisienlakhawm, pakhat chun dawn malamin a kâwk a, “Pathien meu khawm i ṭi naw maw? thuhmun zingin an hrem che hi."
41,And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.,"Eini chu ei tuor âwm tak hrim tuor ei nih, ei thilthaw ra indiktak hmu ei ni chau lem a; ama ruok hin chu iengkhawm a suksuol si nawh,” a ta."
42,"And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.","Chun, “Isu, i ramah lala i hung phaleh, mi hre zing rawh aw,” a ta."
43,"And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril che hi, vawisûn hin ka kuomah Paradisah um vêng i tih,” a ta."
44,"And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,","Chun, nisa inding lai a hung na, chu chena inthawk zânbu suong pha chenin khawvêl a hung inthim ta vawng a, nisa var a hung bo tah a;"
45,the sun’s light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.,"Chun, Pathien biekina puonzâr chu a laiah a lo tlêr tah a."
46,"And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.","Chun, Isu râwl inringtakin a khêk a, “Pa, i kutah ka thlarau kân kawltir,” a ta. Chu chu a ti zo chun a thlarau ân thla tah a."
47,"And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.","Chun, sipai za hotu chun thil umzie chu a hmu chun, “Hi mipa hi matheiloin mi feltak a ni phawt el,” a ta. Pathien ân pâk tah a."
48,"And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.","Chun, chu ennuom chu thlîr dinga mipui hung inkhâwmhai po po chun thil umziehai chu an hmu chun, an âwmhai inchum inchumin in tieng an fe tah a."
49,"And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.","Chun, a hmêlhriethai po po le, nuhmei Galili rama inthawka hung zuihai chu, chuong thil chu thlîrin hlatakah an ngîr a."
50,"And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat a hming Josef, rorêltu mi ṭhatak, feltak a um a,"
51,"(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), a man of Arimathæa, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:","(an rorêl le an thilthaw khawm kha a remti naw hrim a nih), Judai khuo Arimathai mi a na, Pathien ram a beisei hlak a."
52,"this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.","Ama chu Pilat kuomah a feh a, Isu ruong a hnih a."
53,"And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.","Chun, a lâk thlâk a, puon zai inhmiin a tuom a, thlân lung ver kuok, tukhawm lân zâlna ngai nawnaah ân zâl tah a."
54,"And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.","Chun, chu ni chu Inringlâwk ni a na, Châwlni a ni vâng ta sih a."
55,"And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.","Chun, nuhmei Galili rama inthawka ama le hunghai khan an zui pei a, thlân le a ruong inzâlzie chu an hmuh a."
56,"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.","Chun, in tieng an fe nâwk a, thil rim inhnik le hriek rim inhnikhai an buotsai a. Chun, Châwlni chun thupêk angin an châwl tah a."
