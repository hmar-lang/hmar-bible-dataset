verse_no,en,hmr
1,"In the mean time, when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.","Chu sûnga mipui sâng tamtak insir nuk nuk khawp hiel an hung inkhâwm chun, Isûn a hmasatakin a închûktirhai kuomah, “Pharisaihai chawl, vervêknaa in- thawk chun fîmkhur ro."
2,"But there is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.",Inlang lo dinga thuphmang iengkhawm a um si nawh; hriet lo dinga ip iengkhawm a um bawk nawh.
3,Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.,"Chuleiin, inthima in hril taphawt kha varah la hrieng an tih; pindan sûngrila, na bula in thu hril kha in chunga chuongin la khêkpui an tih."
4,"And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.","Chun, ka ruolhai, ka hril cheu hi, taksa sukhluma, chu hnunga ieng- khawm thaw nâwk thei ta nawhai chu ṭi naw ro."
5,"But I will warn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.","Amiruokchu, tû am in ṭi ding hril lâwk ka ti cheu; a sukhlum hnung khawma Hremhmuna pei theina thuneitu chu ṭi ro; anih, ka hril cheu hi, ama mawl chu ṭi ro."
6,Are not five sparrows sold for two pence? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.,"Chawngzawng panga dâr tangka pahniin an zawr hlak a ni naw am a nih? nisienlakhawm, anni laia pakhat khawm Pathienin ân hmei ngai si nawh."
7,But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows.,In samzai chen hin tiem vawng a nih in sawnnaw. Ṭi naw ro; chawngzawng tamtak nêk chun in hlu lem a nih.
8,"And I say unto you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:","“Chun, ka hril cheu hi, mihai hmaa a mi ṭan taphawt chu Pathien vântirkohai hmaah Mihriem Naupa hin ṭan vêng a tih."
9,but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God.,"Nisienlakhawm, mihai hmaa mîn phat chu Pathien vântirkohai hmaah inphat ni vêng a tih."
10,"And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.","Chun, Mihriem Naupa sawisêl chu a sawisêlna chu ngaidam nîng a tih; Thlarau Inthieng meu hrilse ruok chu a hrilsietna chu ngaidam ni naw nih."
11,"And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:","“Chun, inkhâwmna ina mihai, lalhai, hotuhai hmaa an ṭhuoi pha cheu chun, ‘Iengtin am, ieng thuin am dawn ka ta, ieng thu am hril ka ta,’ tiin lungkham naw ro,"
12,for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.,"chu pha taka chun, ieng am in hril ding ti Thlarau Inthieng chun hril a ti cheu,” a ta."
13,"And one out of the multitude said unto him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.","Mipui laia mi tuin amanih Isu kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, ka u kuomah ro mi sem ve dingin hril rawh,” a ta."
14,"But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a kuomah, “Mihriem, nangni chungah tûin am rorêltu le, sum semtuah a mi siem a?” a ta."
15,"And he said unto them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.","Chun, an kuomah, “Fimkhur unla, inhnarna hrim hrima inthawk chun invêng ro, sum hau hi mihriem dam san a ni nawh,” a ta."
16,"And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:","Chun, an kuomah tekhithu a hril a, “Mi hausa tû amanih a lohma a hung hlâwk bêk bêk a."
17,"and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits?","Chuongchun, ân ngaituoh a, ‘Iengtin am thâwng ka tih aw? ka bu le bâl sie khâwmna ka nei si nawh a,’ a ta."
18,"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods.","Chun, ‘Hieng hin thâwng ka tih; ka bu inhai ṭhiek ka ta, a nêka lienin bâwl ka tih; chutaka chun ka bu le ka sum po po sie khâwm ka tih."
19,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.","Chun, ka thlarau kuomah, Thlarau, kum tamtak sûnga dingin sum tamtak în khâwl hi; châwl la, fain dâwn rawh, tîng ka tih,’ a ta."
20,"But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin a kuomah, ‘Invêt, vawizân hin i thlarau an hni ding che a nih; i thil suksuokhai kha tû ta am ni tâng a ta le?’” a ta."
21,"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.","“Mâni ta dinga sum inkhâwl a, Pathien tienga hau si naw chu, chuong ang chu a ni hlak,” a ta."
22,"And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.","Chun, a inchûktirhai kuomah, “Chuleiin, ka hril cheu hi, ‘Ieng am fâng ka ta aw?’ tiin in hringna thu le, ‘Ieng am silin bil ka ta aw?’ tiin in taksa thu lungkham naw ro."
23,"For the life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment.","Fâk ding nêkin hringna a thupui lem a nih, silfên nêk khawmin taksa a thupui lem a nih."
24,"Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the birds!","Vaâkhai hi ngaituo ro, bu an tu ngai nawh, an sîk ngai nawh, bupanghai, bu inhai khawm an nei nawh; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin a châwm sih a; nangni chu vatehai nêk chun in hlut lemzie chu."
25,And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life?,"Chun, nangni lai lungkham leiin tûin am mâni dung tieng tawng khata suksâng chuong thei um cheu?"
26,"If then ye are not able to do even that which is least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest?","Hi el khawm hi thaw thei lo cheu a, iengdinga thil dang in lungkham am a na?"
27,"Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","“Tûktinpâr inṭhangzie hi ngai- tuo ro; sin an thaw nawh, pat khawm an kher ngai nawh; nisienlakhawm, ka hril cheu hi, Solomon meu khawm a ropuina po poa ân thuom khan, hieng tûktinpâr pakhat tluk khawm hin cheiin a um nawh."
28,"But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more shall he clothe you, O ye of little faith?","Chuongchun, ram sâwlhna vawisûn anga hring, a zînga thuka ti nâwk el ding hman, Pathienin chuong ang lâwma a chei chun, aw, nangni ringna tlâwmhai, chuonghai nêk chun silfên a va pêk âwm cheu deh e!"
29,"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.","“Chun, in fâk dinghai, in dâwn dinghai zawng naw ro; lungâwpin- kaiin um bawk naw ro."
30,For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.,"Khawvêla hnam po poin chuong po po chu an zawng hlak, chuong chu in mamaw ti in Pa vâna miin a hriet zing sih a."
31,"Yet seek ye his kingdom, and these things shall be added unto you.","Ama ram zawng lem ro, chuongchun, chuong thil khawm chu a pêk sa ding cheu a nih."
32,"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.","“Pâwl tlâwmhai, ṭi naw ro; ram pêk cheu hi in Pa lâwm zâwng tak a nih."
33,"Sell that which ye have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither moth destroyeth.","In nei taphawt chu zawr unla, pasiehai kuomah pe ro; vânah inru fe nawnaah, hângthim fâk siet nawnaa chun, tangka ip hlui thei nawhai, ro inhmang thei nawhai, inkhâwl ro."
34,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.",In ro umna taphawtah in lungril khawm a um ding a ni sih a.
35,"Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning;","“Dier kei zingin, in khâwnvar khawm chawk zingin um ro;"
36,"and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord, when he shall return from the marriage feast; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open unto him.","miin an pu, inneina ruoiṭhe fa a hung phaa kawtkhâr a hung nawk phaa lo hawngpêk thei nghâl dinga an lo nghâk zing ang hin um ro."
37,"Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and shall come and serve them.","An pu a hung phaa suok lo nghâk zinga a hmu dinghai chu an hamṭha. Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, ama chun a dier hung kei a ta, anni chu thlaithlêng awtin inṭhungtir a ta, an rawng hung bâwlpêk a tih."
38,"And if he shall come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find them so, blessed are those servants.","Zân rila manih, tho phain amanih a hung a, chuong anga a hung hmu chun, chuong suokhai chu hamṭhâng an tih."
39,"But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not have left his house to be broken through.","Amiruokchu, hi hi hre ro, inru a hung ding hun in neitu chun hre sienla, vêng a ta, a in inverpawptir naw ni."
40,Be ye also ready: for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.,"Nangni khawm inring zingin um ro, in ring naw hunah Mihriem Naupa chu a hung ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
41,"And Peter said, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto all?","Chun, Peterin a kuomah, “Lalpa, hi tekhithu hi keini chau am a nih i mi hril, mi po po?” a ta."
42,"And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season?","Chun, Lalpain, “Sum enkawltu ringum, var tak, a puin a hun poa an bu chan ding sempêk dingin a sûnghai chunga hotua a siem ding chu tû tak am nîng a ta?"
43,"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.",A pu a hung phaleh suok chuong anga thawa a hung hmu ding chu a hamṭha.
44,"Of a truth I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.","Indiktakin ka hril cheu hi, a nei po po chunga hotuah siem a tih."
45,"But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;","Amiruokchu, chu suok chun, a lungrilin ‘Ka pu hung vak naw ni,’ tiin suoknuhai, suokpahai lo vaw sienla, fain dâwnin lo inrui ta sienla;"
46,"the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful.","chu suok pu chu a ring naw niah, a hriet naw kâr hung a ta, bawng hni hung insuong a ta, mi ringum nawhai chan ang hung inchangtir a tih."
47,"And that servant, who knew his lord’s will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;","Suok a pu dit zâwng hre zing sia, lo inring loa, a pu dit zâwng ang khawma thaw lo chu, vawi tamtak vuong an tih."
48,"but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. And to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.","Amiruokchu, hriet naw leia vuokna khawp thil thaw chu, vawi tlâwmtê vuong an tih. Tûkhawm tamtak an ipêk kuoma chun tamtak phût an tih; tûkhawm tamtak an inkawltir kuoma chun tam deu phût an tih."
49,"I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what do I desire, if it is already kindled?",“Khawvêlah mei thlâk thla dinga hung ka nih; tu khawm hin kâng nghâl ta sien ka va ti de!
50,But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!,"Nisienlakhawm, baptisma chang ding ka nei, chu chu tleitlâk hmakhat chu ka chung a va rik de aw!"
51,"Think ye that I am come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:","Khawvêlah inremna inlêngtir dinga hung in mi sâwn am a nih? Teu lo e, ka hril cheu hi, indo inlêngtir dinga hung ka ni lem a nih;"
52,"for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.","tuta hnung chu sûngkhata mi panga indo an tih, pathumin pahni, pahniin pathum."
53,"They shall be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.","Pain a naupa, naupain a pa, a nuin a naunu, a naunu chun a nu; a piin mo, moin a pi, do a tih,” a ta."
54,"And he said to the multitudes also, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it cometh to pass.","Chun, mipui kuoma khawm chun, “Thlang tienga sûm suok in hmu chun ‘Ruo a sûr ding a nih,’ in ti nghâl hlak a, chun, a hung ni ngei hlak."
55,"And when ye see a south wind blowing, ye say, There will be a scorching heat; and it cometh to pass.","Chun, sim thli hrâng in hriet chun, ‘Khuo a sa ding a nih,’ in ti hlak a; chun, a hung ni ngei hlak."
56,"Ye hypocrites, ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time?","Nangni vervêkhai, khawvêl le vân umzie khawm in hriet fie thei sih a, iengdinga tulai thil in hriet fie thei naw am a na?"
57,And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?,“Iengdinga nangnîn a fel chu in ngaituo naw am a na?
58,"For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate, on the way give diligence to be quit of him; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer, and the officer shall cast thee into prison.","Rorêltu hmaa i khingpui leh i fe pha, fe malamin amaa inthawka fihlîmna mawl zawng rawh; chuong naw chun rorêltu hmaah ṭhuoi ṭâl a ti cheh a, rorêltu chun mi man hotu inmantir a ti cheh a, mi man hotu chun intângna inah khum hlau rawi a ti che."
59,"I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the very last mite.","Ka hril cheu hi, dâr tangka dere hlek chen khawma i tlâk kim hmakhat chu, chutaka inthawk chu suok naw ṭhuoi i tih,” a ta."
