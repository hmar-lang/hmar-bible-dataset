1,And he entered and was passing through Jericho.,"Chun, Isu Jeriko khuoah a lût a, a fethleng ding a na."
2,"And behold, a man called by name Zacchæus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich.","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat a hming Zakai a um a; ama chu siedâwl hotu a na, a hausa hleh a."
3,"And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.","Chun, Isu chu mi ieng ang am a ni hmu a tum a; mipui leiin a hmu thei nawh a, ama hlak ân hnuoi sih a."
4,"And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.","Chuongchun, a tlân khal a, a en dingin theichang lêrah a lâwn a; chu lampui chu a hung hraw ding a ni leiin."
5,"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said unto him, Zacchæus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.","Chun, Isu chu chu hmun a tlung chun a tang a, a kuomah, “Zakai, hung ṭum vak rawh; vawisûn i inah ka tlung ding a nih,” a ta."
6,"And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.","Chun, inhmawtakin a ṭum a, hlimtakin ama chu ân tlungtir tah a."
7,"And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner.","Chun, chu chu an hmu phingleh an rêngin, “Mi suol kuoma tlung dingin a lût ta saw,” an tih a, an chier a."
8,"And Zacchæus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold.","Chun, Zakai chu a ngir a, Lalpa kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, Lalpa, ka sum zâtve pasiehai kuomah pêng ka ta; chun, tu chunga khawm thil ieng khawm lo hlêpru ka ni chun a lêt liin thung nâwk ka tih,” a ta."
9,"And Jesus said unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.","Chun, Isûn Zakai chungthu a hril a, “Vawisûn hi ina hin sandamna a hung tlung tah, ama khawm Abraham naupa a ni sih a."
10,For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.,"Bohmanghai zawnga sandam dingin Mihriem Naupa hi a hung a ni hrim a nih,” a ta."
11,"And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.","Chun, chuong thuhai chu an ngâi laiin, Jerusalem a hnai ta leiin le Pathien ram hung inlang nghâl ding nia an ring leiin tekhithu a hril sah a."
12,"He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.","Chuongchun, hieng thu hi a hril a, “Mi ṭha tû amanih ram awpna thu laa hung kîr nâwk dingin ram hlatakah a feh a."
13,"And he called ten servants of his, and gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye herewith till I come.","A fe dingin a suokhai sâwm a ko a, an kuomah rângkachak tangka sâwm a pêk a, an kuomah, ‘Ka hung tlung nâwk hmakhat chu hi hin lo sumdâwng ro,’ a ta."
14,"But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us.","Nisienlakhawm, a khuohaiin an theidah a, ‘Hi mipa hi kan lal dingin kan dit nawh,’ ti dingin a hnungah palai an intlântir veh a."
15,"And it came to pass, when he was come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, unto whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.","“Chun, ram awpna thu chu a lâka a hung kir nâwk chun, a suok tangka a ipêkhai chu, an sukpung dân inhrietna dingin ân kotir a."
16,"And the first came before him, saying, Lord, thy pound hath made ten pounds more.","Chun, a hmasatak chu a hung a, ‘Pu, i rângkachak tangka kha sâwmin a pung,’ a ta."
17,"And he said unto him, Well done, thou good servant: because thou wast found faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.","Ama chun a kuomah, ‘Suok ṭha, i thaw ṭha ie, tlâwmtê chungah ring i um leiin khaw sâwm chungah hotuin um rawh,’ a ta."
18,"And the second came, saying, Thy pound, Lord, hath made five pounds.","Chun, a dawttu chu a hung a, ‘Pu, i rângkachak tangkas kha pangain a pung ie,’ a ta."
19,"And he said unto him also, Be thou also over five cities.","Chun, ama chun ama kuoma khawm chun, ‘Nang khawm khaw panga chungah hotuin um rawh,’ a ta."
20,"And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin:","“Chun, mi dang a hung a, ‘Pu, en ta, hi i rângkachak tangka kha! thlanhrûkna puonin ka fûn zing;"
21,"for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou layedst not down, and reapest that which thou didst not sow.","mi vîntak i ni leiin ka ṭi che a nih; i sie naw khawm i lâk hlak a, i tu naw khawm i sîk hlak sih a,’ a ta."
22,"He saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow;","“Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘Suok suol, i ṭawngbau suok ngeiin kân thiem naw che. Mi vîntak ka na, ka sie naw khawm ka lâk a, ka tu naw khawm ka sîk hlak ti i hriet maw?"
23,"then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?","A ni sa chun, ka tangka hi iengdinga sumdâwng ina i sie naw am a na? Chuongchun, ka hung hin a pung leh ka hung ṭhîn ding bah,’ a ta."
24,"And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds.","Chun, a kâwla ngirhai kuomah, ‘A rângkachak tangka kha lâkpêk unla, rângkachak tangka sâwm neitu kuomah pe ro,’ a ta."
25,"And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, ‘Pu, ama chun rângkachak tangka sâwm a nei annawm’ an ta."
26,"I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.","‘Ka ti cheu hi, a nei taphawt chu pe belsâng an ta, a nei naw chu a nei sun khawm chu lâkpêk an tih."
27,"But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.","Nisienlakhawm, hieng a mi dotuhai an lal dinga mi dit nawhai hi hung ṭhuoi unla, ka hmaah that ro,’ a tih a,” a ta."
28,"And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.","Chun, chuong ang thu a hril zo chun Jerusalem panin a hmasah a."
29,"And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,","Bethphage le Bethani khaw kâwl, Oliv tlâng an ti chu a tlung chun, inchûktirhai laia mi pahni a tir a,"
30,"saying, Go your way into the village over against you; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him.","“In hma zâwn khuoa sawn va fe unla, chuongchun, in lût hlimin sabengtungtê thlung tukhawm la chuongna ngai naw va hmûng in tih; chu chu sût unla, hung kei ro."
31,"And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him.","Chun, tûkhawmin, ‘Iengdinga in sût am?’ tia an indawn cheu chun, ‘Lalpain a mamaw a nih,’ tiin hril ro,” a ta."
32,"And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them.","Chun, a tirhai chu an fe tah a, an kuoma a hril ang ngeiin an va hmuh a."
33,"And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?","Chun, sabengtungtê chu an sût lai chun, a neituhaiin an kuomah, “Sabengtungtê kha iengdinga in sût am?” an ta."
34,"And they said, The Lord hath need of him.","Chun, anni chun, “Lalpain a mamaw a nih,” an tih a."
35,"And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon.","Chuongchun, Isu kuomah an hung kei a; chun, sabengtungtê chunga chun an puonhai an phah a, a chungah Isu an inchuongtir a."
36,"And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.","Chun, a fena ding lampuia chun an puonhai an pha pei a."
37,"And as he was now drawing nigh, even at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;","Chun, a tlung ding tâwmin, Oliv tlâng liem tâwmin inchûktir mipui po po chun a thilmak thawhai po po an hmu leiin an lâwm a, râwl inringtakin Pathien an inpâk a,"
38,"saying, Blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.","“Lalpa hminga hung chu inpâkin um raw se; vânah inremna inlêng sienla, achunghnungtaka khin ropuina um raw se,” tiin."
39,"And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.","Chun, mipui laia Pharisai ṭhenkhatin a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, i închûktirhai hi kâwk rawh,” an ta."
40,"And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.","Ama ruok chun, “Ka hril cheu hi, hienghai hi an to zing chun, lunghai bêk an khêk suok ding a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
41,"And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it,","Chun, a tlung ding ṭepin, khuo chu a hmuh a, a ṭap nghah a,"
42,"saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.","“Aw, nang hin tuta sûng hin thlamuongna ding thu hi lo hre hrâm la chu aw! Nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu i hmu thei nawna dingin ân thup ta sih a."
43,"For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,","Hieng ang nihai hi i chungah a la tlung ding a ni sih a; i râlhaiin i vêlin hnuoi kul siem an ta, inhuol an ti cheh a;"
44,"and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.","i sûngah i nauhai le nang leh hnuoiah pei rak an ti che; i sûngah lung inthuo hrim hrim hla naw ni hai, an fang lai che i hriet naw leiin,” tiin."
45,"And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,","Chun, Pathien biekina chun a va lût a, iengkhat zawrtuhai chu a hnawt dawk tah a;"
46,"saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.","an kuomah, “ ‘Ka in chu ṭawng- ṭaina in nîng a tih,’ ti ziek a nih; nangni ruok chun suomhmanghai pûkah in siem lem hi,” a ta."
47,And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:,"Chun, ni tin Pathien biekina chun ân chûktir hlak a. Chun, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai leh, vântlâng laia hotu deuhaiin, ama sukbohmang an tum a;"
48,"and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.","nisienlakhawm, mihaiin ṭha- hnemngaitaka thu an ngai leiin, a thaw ngaina an hriet si nawh."
