1,"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,","Eini laia kha thil hung tlung kha mi tamtakin ziek an tum tah a,"
2,"even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,","a tira inthawka hmutuhai le thu rawngbâwltuhaiin eini an mi hril ang khan,"
3,"it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus;","chuleiin, Theophil Ṭhatak, a bula inthawkin iengkim feltakin ka sui a, indawt peiin i ta dingin ziek lang ṭhain ka hriet a;"
4,that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.,kha hmaa thu an inchûktir che kha indiktak a nih ti i hriet theina dingin.
5,"There was in the days of Herod, king of Judæa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.","Judai ram lal Herod a dam laiin, Abija pâwla mi a hming Zakaria, thiempu pakhat a um a. Ama chun Aron thlaa mi nuhmeiin a nei a, a hming chu Elizabeth a nih."
6,"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.","An pahni chun Pathien mit- hmuah feltakin an um a, sawisêlboin Lalpa thupêk le a dân po po zâwmin an um hlak."
7,"And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.","Nisienlakhawm, Elizabeth chu a ching leiin nau an nei nawh a, an pahni chun upatak an ni sih a."
8,"Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,","Chun, a pâwlhai thaw dân ang peia Pathien hmaa thiempu sin a thaw laiin,"
9,"according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.",thiempu dân angin Lalpa biekina lût le riminhnik raw sin a chang a.
10,And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.,"Chun, riminhnik chu a raw hun laiin mipui chu an rêngin tuolah an ṭawngṭai a."
11,And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.,"Chun, Lalpa vântirko pakhat thil riminhnik râwna mâichâm changtieng chun a hung inlâr a."
12,"And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.","Chun, Zakaria chun a hmu phingleh a lunginzîng a, ṭi khawm a ṭih a."
13,"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.","Nisienlakhawm, vântirko chun a kuomah, “Zakaria, ṭi naw, i hni kha hriet a nih, i nuhmei Elizabethin naupasal neipêk a ti che, a hmingah Johan i sak ding a nih."
14,And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.,"Chun, nang hlimin lâwm i ta, ama a pieng chun mi tamtak lâwm bawk an tih."
15,"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.","Lalpa ngaiin mi lien nîng a ta, uoin le zu hrim hrim dâwn naw ni; a nu phing sûnga inthawkin Thlarau Inthiengin hung sip a tih,"
16,And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God.,Israel thlahai tamtak Lalpa an Pathien kuom tieng innghattir nâwk a tih.
17,"And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to walk in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.","Chun, pahai lungril chu nauhai tienga innghattir ding dâm, mi kâwmawhai chu mi feltak varna tienga innghattir ding dâm, Lalpa ta dinga mihai lo buotsai dingin Elija lungril le thilthawtheina putin Lalpa hmaah fêng a tih,” a ta."
18,"And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.","Chun, Zakariain vântirko kuomah chun, “Chu chu iengtin am hrieng ka ta? kei putar ka na, ka nuhmei khawm pitar a ni sih a,” a ta."
19,"And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.","Vântirko chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Gabriel, Pathien hmaa ngîr hlak ka na; a be ding che le, chuong thu ṭha chu hril ding chea hung tir ka nih."
20,"And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.","Ngai rawh, ka thu hrilhai, a hun taka hung tlung ding chu i awi naw leiin chuong thil chu a hung tlung hmakhat chu to zing i ta, ṭawng thei naw ti ni,” a tih a."
21,"And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple.","Chun, mipuihai chun Zakaria chu an lo nghâk a, Pathien biekin sûnga a um sâwt lei chun mak an ti hleh a."
22,"And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.","Chun, a hung suok chun an kuomah thu a hril thei ta nawh a; chuongchun, biekinah inlârna a hmu a nih ti an hriet tah a; anni chu kut zaizirin a biek hlak a, chun ṭawng thei loin a um ta zing a."
23,"And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.","Chun, a rawngbâwlna ni chu a kim phingleh a inah a fe tah a."
24,"And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,","Chu hnunga chun a nuhmei Elizabeth chu a hung inrai a, thla nga ân thup a."
25,"Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.","“Mi kuoma ka hming sie inkhumna dingin, Lalpain a mi hmuh a, hieng ang hin a mi thawpêk a ni hi,” a ta."
26,"Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,","Chun, a thla ruknaa chun Pathienin vântirko Gabriel chu Galili rama khuo pakhat Nazareth an tia chun,"
27,"to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.",nunghâk inthieng pakhat kuomah a tir a; ama chu David thlaa mi a hming Josef nuhmei huol a na; chu nunghâk hming chu Mari a nih.
28,"And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee.","Chun, vântirko chu a kuomah a lût a, “Chibai, Vochuom, Lalpa i kuomah a um” a ta."
29,"But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be.","Chun, chu thu hril lei chun a lunginzîng ta bêk bêk a, “Iengtiziea chibai a mi bûk am nîng a tih aw,” tiin ân ngaituoh a."
30,"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.","Chun, vântirko chun a kuomah, “Mari, ṭi naw, Pathien ngaisak zâwng i nih."
31,"And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.","Ngai rawh, inrai i ta, naupasal nei i ta, a hminga chun Isu i sak ding a nih."
32,"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:","Ama chu mi lien la nîng a ta, Achunghnungtak Naupa tîng an tih; Lalpa Pathienin a thlatu David ṭhungpha chu pêng a ta;"
33,and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.,"Jakob thlahai chungah cha- tuonin inlal a ta, a ramin tâwp ni nei naw ni,” a ta."
34,"And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?","Chun, Mari chun vântirko kuomah chun, “Chuong chu iengtin am ni thei a ti leh, pasal ka nei si nawh a?” a ta."
35,"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God.","Chun, vântirko chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Thlarau Inthieng i chungah hung tlung a ta, Achung- hnungtak thilthawtheina chun hlie- khûng a che; chuleiin, naupang hung pieng ding khawm chu mi inthieng, Pathien Naupa tîng an tih."
36,"And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren.","Chun, ngai ta, i zuorpuinu Elizabeth khawmin tar hnungin naupasal a vawn tah a; a ching an ti hlak kha, tuta thla hi a thla rukna a ni tah."
37,For no word from God shall be void of power.,"Pathien ta ding chun thaw thei naw iengkhawm a um si nawh a,” a ta."
38,"And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.","Chun, Marin, “Ngai ta, Lalpa suoknu ka nih, i hril ang tak chun ka chungah tlung raw se,” a ta. Chun, vântirko chun a fe san tah a."
39,"And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;","Chuong lai chun Mari chu a tho a, thingtlângah, Judai rama khuo pakhata chun a fe tah a;"
40,and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth.,"chun, Zakaria inah a lût a, Elizabeth chibai a bûk a."
41,"And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit;","Chun, Elizabethin Mari chibai bûk chu a hriet phingleh, a phîng sûnga naute chu a châng a; chun, Elizabeth chu Thlarau Inthiengin a sip tah a;"
42,"and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.","râwl inringtakin a khêk a, “Nang chu nuhmei lai poah inpâktlâk i nih; i rîla ra khawm inpâktlâk a nih."
43,"And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me?",Ka Lalpa nu ka kuoma i hung hi iengtizie am a na?
44,"For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.","Ngai ta, i chibai bûk ri ka naah a lût phingleh a lâwm leiin nautê ka phîng sûngah ân châwm a nih."
45,And blessed is she that believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.,"A kuoma Lalpân thu a hril kha a tlung ding a ni ti ringnu chu a hamṭha,” a ta."
46,"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,","Chun, Marin, “Ka hringnân Lalpa a chawimawi a,"
47,And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.,"Ka thlarau khawm a mi sandamtu Pathien chungah a lâwm bêk bêk a,"
48,"For he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid: For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.","A suoknu tlâwmzie a hmuh a, a lunginsiet a, Ngai rawh, tuta inthawkin ruolthar po poin hamṭha an mi ti ding a nih."
49,For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; And holy is his name.,"Mi hrât khan ka chungah thil ropuitak a mi thawpêk a,"
50,And his mercy is unto generations and generations On them that fear him.,"A hming khawm ân thieng a nih, A ṭituhai chu suon po po chenin a lunginsiet pei hlak."
51,He hath showed strength with his arm; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.,"A bânin a tha hrâtzie ân entir a, An inngaituonaa chapohai chu a sukdar tah a."
52,"He hath put down princes from their thrones, And hath exalted them of low degree.",An ṭhungphaa lal inṭhunghai chu a hnûk thlâk a. Mi inhnuoihai chu a dawm sâng tah a.
53,The hungry he hath filled with good things; And the rich he hath sent empty away.,"Phîng ṭamhai chu thil ṭhatakin a sukkhawp tah a, Hausahai chu kutruokin ân fe hmangtir tah a."
54,"He hath given help to Israel his servant, That he might remember mercy","A siehlaw Israelhai chu a sawmdâwl tah a, Ei thlatuhai kuoma a lo hril ta ang ngei khan;"
55,(As he spake unto our fathers) Toward Abraham and his seed for ever.,"Abraham le a thlahai chu chatuona a lunginsiet dingzie hriet zingna dingin,” a ta."
56,"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.","Chun, Mari chu thla thum lai a kuomah a um a; chun, a in tieng a fe nâwk tah a."
57,Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.,"Chun, Elizabeth nau nei chu a hung hun tah a; naupasal a nei tah a."
58,And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.,"Chun, a vênghai le a laibunghai chun, Lalpân a lunginsiet ti an lo hriet a, an lâwmpui a."
59,"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.","Chun, ni riet nia chun nautê ser tan dingin an hung a; a hmingah a pa hming bawk, Zakaria sak an tum a."
60,"And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.","Nisienlakhawm, a nu chun, “Ni lo e, ama chu Johan sak lem ding a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
61,"And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.","Chun, annîn a kuomah, “I laibunghai lai hi hming put hi tukhawm an um lêm,” an ta."
62,"And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.","Chun, a pa kuoma chun kut zaizirin, “A hmingah ieng am sak inla i nuom a?” an ta."
63,"And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.","Chun, lekha ziekna lung phêk a hnih a, “A hming Johan a nih,” tiin a ziek a. An rêngin mak an ti hleh a."
64,"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, blessing God.","Chun, kârloin a lei le a bau chu a hung insût a. Pathien inpâkin a hung ṭawng suok tah a."
65,And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa.,"Chun, an vêla umhai po po chun an ṭi tah a. Chun, chuong thu chu Judai ram thingtlâng po poah ân thang tah a."
66,"And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.","A hre taphawt chun an lungrilah lungkhamah an nei a, “Chu nautê chu iengtin takin am la hung um a tih aw,” an ta; Lalpa kutin ama a ṭhangpui sih a."
67,"And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,","Chun, a pa Zakaria chu Thlarau Inthiengin a sip a, a hrillâwk a,"
68,"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,","“Lalpa Israel Pathien chu, inpâkin um raw se, A mihai chu a hung kan a, intlanna a siempêk a,"
69,And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his servant David,"A siehlaw David sûnghai lai chun, Sandamna ki a mi siempêk ta sih a;"
70,"(As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),",(Leihnuoi insieng tîra a zâwlnei inthienghai baua a hril ang khan).
71,"Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;",Ei hmêlmahai le a mi theidatuhai po po kuta inthawka mi sansuok dinga a lo intiem thu dâm;
72,"To show mercy towards our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant;","Ei thlâtuhai kuoma a ngilneina suklang a lo tiem thu le, A thuthlung inthieng hre zing dingin,"
73,"The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father,",Chu thuthlung chu inkhâmin ei thlâtu Abraham kuomah a lo tiem tah a;
74,"To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies Should serve him without fear,","Chuongchun, ei hmêlmahai kuta inthawka mi sanhimin, ṭi loa a rawng ei bâwl theina ding le,"
75,In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.,"Ei dam sûnga a mithmua inthieng le feltaka ei um zing theina ding chu, a mi hung ruotpêk ta a nih."
76,"Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High: For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways;","Anih, Bawipu, nang hi Achunghnungtak zâwlnei tîng an ti che. A lampuihai siem dingin Lalpa hmaah i fe ding a ni sih a;"
77,"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people In the remission of their sins,","An suolhai ngaidamna dinga, A mihai kuoma sandamna thu inhriettir dingin;"
78,"Because of the tender mercy of our God, Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,","Ei Pathien lunginsietna leiin, Chungtienga inthawkin nisa suokin mi hung sir a ta,"
79,To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace.,"Inthim lai le thina hlima inṭhunghai ên ding le, Thlamuongna lampuia ei kehai mîn pêntir dingin,” tiin."
80,"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.","Chun, nautê chu a hung lien deu deu a, a thlarau tieng a hung hrât ta deu deu a, Israelhai kuoma a hung insuklang hmakhat chu thlalêrah a um zing a."
