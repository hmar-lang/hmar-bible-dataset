1,"And he said unto his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe unto him, through whom they come!","Chun, Isûn a închûktirhai kuomah, “Tlûknahai um naw thei a ni nawh; nisienlakhawm, tlûkna inumtirtu chung chu a rik!"
2,"It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.","Hieng mi chînhai laia pakhat khawm sukthlûk nêk chun, a sukthlutu ding rînga chun bu râwt nawina lung inhlitirin, tuisuorietah thlâk ni sienla, a ta dingin ṭha lem a tih."
3,"Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.","“Fîmkhur ro, i unauin thil a suksuol chun kâwk rawh; ân sîr chun ngaidam rawh."
4,"And if he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.","Ni khatah vawi sari i chungah thil suksuolin, vawi sari, ‘Kân sîr,’ tia nanga tieng a ngha nâwk chun, i ngaidam ding a nih,” a ta."
5,"And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.","Chun, tîrkohai chun Lalpa kuomah, “Kan ringna sukphui deu raw khai,” an ta."
6,"And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.","Chun, Lalpa chun, “Anṭam mu mal khat ang ringna in nei chun, hi thingtheihmi kûng kuoma hin, ‘Hung inphawi la, tuisuorietah lo inphun rawh,’ tîng in ta, in thu awi el a tih."
7,"But who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come straightway and sit down to meat;","“Nisienlakhawm, nangni laia tûkhawm hnuoi inletin amanih, berâm vêngin amanih, suok nei sienla, a lo fe hung pha, ‘Bu hung fa nghâl rawh,’ a lo ti ding am a nih?"
8,"and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?","‘Ka fâk ding mi siempêk la, puon dierkei la, ka fâk ka dâwn khawp hmakhat chun ka rawng bâwl rawh; chu hnunga chun nangin fain, dâwn i tih,’ a lo ti lem naw ding am a nih?"
9,Doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded?,In thu anga a thaw leiin in suok kuomah lâwmthu in hril hlak am a nih?
10,"Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do.","Chuong ang bawkin, nangni khawmin in kuomah thupêk ang po poa in thaw zo phaleh, ‘Suok ṭhahnem naw kan nih ie; kan thaw ding hrim kan thaw a nih,’ ti ro,” a ta."
11,"And it came to pass, as they were on the way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.","Chun, Jerusalema an fe dingin, Samari le Galili ram chu a fe thleng a."
12,"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:","Chun, khaw ienga manih a lût dingin, mi inphâr ruok sâwmin an intuokpui a; chuonghai chu hlatakah an ngîr a,"
13,"and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.","chun, râwl inringtakin, “Isu inchûktirtu, mi lunginsiet rawh,” an ta."
14,"And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.","Chun, ama chun anni chu a hang hmu chun, “Thiempuhai kuomah vân entir ro,” a ta. Chun, an fe lai chun an hung inthieng tâwl tah a."
15,"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;","Chun, anni laia pakhat chun a dam tah ti ân hriet phingleh, râwl inringtaka Pathien inpâk pei pumin a kîr nâwk tah a;"
16,"and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.","chun, a ke bulah a bawkkhup a, a lâwmthu a hril a; chun, ama chu Samari mi a ni nghe ngheh a."
17,"And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?","Chuongchun, Isûn a dawn a, “Mi sâwm kha in hung inthieng tah a ni naw am a nih? Pakuohai kha khâwlai am an um a?"
18,"Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?","Pathien inpâk dinga kîr nâwk, hi hnam dang mi chau naw hi tukhawm hmuin an um naw a ni maw?” a ta."
19,"And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.","Chun, a kuomah, “Tho la, fe rawh, i ringna hi i dampui a ni hi,” a ta."
20,"And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:","Chun, Pharisaihaiin Pathien ram hung tlung ding hun an indawn leiin an kuomah, “Pathien ram chu hmu theiin a hung tlung nawh ie,"
21,"neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you.","‘En ta, hitaka hi,’ amanih, ‘Sawtaka saw,’ amanih ti bawk naw ni hai; ngai ta u, Pathien ram chu nangni lai a um a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
22,"And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.","Chun, inchûktirhai kuoma chun, “Mihriem Naupa dam lai nihai ni khat bêk hi in hmu nuom nihai la um a tih; nisienlakhawm, hmu ta si naw ti niu."
23,"And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after them:","Chun, in kuomah, ‘En ta sawtaka saw!’ ‘En ta, hitaka hi!’ tîng an ti cheu; fe suok naw unla, anni chu zui bawk naw ro,"
24,"for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day.","kâwlkawdawng khing tienga kâwl ân lep a, kâwlkawdawng khing tieng chenah a var hlak ang hin, Mihriem Naupa hi a hung ni chun a um ding a ni sih a."
25,But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.,"Nisienlakhawm, chu hma chun thil tamtak tuor a ta, hi ruoltharhai ditnawin um bawk a tih."
26,"And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.","“Noa dam laia thil umzie ang khan, Mihriem Naupa a hung nâwk nihai chun um bawk a tih."
27,"They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.","Noa lawngah a lût a, tui a hung lêt a, an rênga a sukhlum vawng ni kha a tlung hmakhat chun, an fâkin an dâwn a, nuhmei pasal an innei hlak."
28,"Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;","“Chuong ang bawkin Lota dam laiin a hung um a: an fâkin an dâwn a, an inchâwkin an zawr a, an chîngin an bâwl hlak a;"
29,"but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:","nisienlakhawm, Sodom khuoa inthawka Lota a suok ni chun vâna inthawkin mei le kâtin a sûr a, an rêngin a sukhlum vawng tah a."
30,after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.,Chuong ang bawk chun Mihriem Naupa hung inlâr ni chun um a tih.
31,"In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back.","Chu ni chun tûkhawm a sum in sûnga uma, ama in chunga um chu, inchu dingin ṭum naw raw se; loa um chu hung bawk naw raw se."
32,Remember Lot’s wife.,Lota nuhmei hre zing ro.
33,Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.,"“Tûkhawm a hringna hum- himna zawng taphawt chun chân a ta, tûkhawm a hringna chân taphawt chun humhim a tih."
34,"I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.","“Ka hril cheu hi, chu zân chun khum pakhatah mi pahni um an ta, pakhat chu fe hmangpuiin um a ta, pakhat chu mâksanin um a tih."
35,"There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.","Nuhmei pahni bu râwtnawiin um an ta, pakhat chu fe hmangpuiin um a ta, pakhat chu mâksanin um a tih."
36,,"[Mi pahni loah um an ta, pakhat chu fe hmangpuiin um a ta, pakhat chu mâksanin um a tih,”] a ta."
37,"And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body is, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, khâwlai am ie?” an tih a, an dawn a. Ama chun an kuomah, “Sa- ruong umna taphawtah mulukawlhai khawm um khâwm an tih,” a ta."
