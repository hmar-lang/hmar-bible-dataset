1,"After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.","Chun, mihai hrieta a thu po po a hril zoin, Kapernaumah a lût a."
2,"And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death.","Chun, sipai za hotu tû amanih a suok dittak a dam nawh a, a thi vâng vâng a."
3,"And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant.","Chuongchun, Isu chanchin a hriet phingleh a suok chu hung sukdam dinga ngên hrâm dingin a kuomah Juda upahai a tir a."
4,"And they, when they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him;","Chun, anni chu Isu kuom an va tlung a, ṭhahnemngaitakin an ngên a, “Ama hi, i thawpêk tlâk a nih:"
5,"for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue.","ei hnam dâm a hmangai a, kan inkhâwmna in dâm a mi bâwlpêk a nih,” an ta."
6,"And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof:","Chuongchun, Isu chun anni a zui tah a. Chun, in an tlung vâng vângin sipai za hotu chun a kuomah a ruolhai a tir a, “Intak sakin hung naw rawh, ka in sûng i lûtna tlâk a ni nawh;"
7,"wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.","chuleiin, i kuoma hung tlâk khawm niin kân ring nawh a, thu chau hril la ka naupang dam el a tih."
8,"For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.","Kei khawm mi thua um ka na, ka hnuoiah sipaihai an um a; hi mipa kuoma hin, ‘Fe rawh’ ka ti leh a feh a; mi dang kuoma khawm, ‘Hung rawh’ ka ti leh a hung hlak; ka suok kuoma khawm, ‘Hi hi thaw rawh,’ ka ti leh a thaw hlak,” a ta."
9,"And when Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.","Chun, Isûn chuong thu chu a hrietin ama chu mak a ti hleh a, a nghah a, mipui a zuituhai kuoma chun, “Ka hril cheu hi, Israelhai lai khawm hieng ang lâwma ringna nasa hi ka hmu nawh,” a ta."
10,"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.","Chun, a mi tirhai chu in tieng an fe nâwk a, suok chu damin an hmu tah a."
11,"And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude.","Chun, sâwt nawteah khaw pa- khat Nain an tia chun a feh a; a închûktirhai le mipui nasatak a kuomah an fe veh a."
12,"Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.","Chun, kul kawtkhâr kâwl a tlungin, ngai ta, mithi an hung zâwn dawk a, a nu naupa nei sun a na, ama hlak hmeithai a ni sih a; an khuohai tamtak chu a kuomah an um a."
13,"And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.","Chun, Lalpa chun hmeithai chu a hmu phingleh a lunginsiet bêk bêk a, “Ṭap naw,” a ta."
14,"And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.","Chun, a va hnai a, hlâng chu a them a; chuongchun, a zâwntuhai chu an ngîr a. Chun, “Tlangvâl, tho rawh ka ti che hi,” a ta."
15,"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.","Chun, mithi chu a ṭhung dawk a, a hung ṭawng tah a. Chun, Isûn a nu kuomah a pêk tah a."
16,"And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people.","Chun, mi po poin an ṭih a, Pathien an inpâk a, “Eini lai zâwlnei ropuitak a hung um ta a ni hi,” an ta. “Pathienin a mihai a hung sîr tah a nih,” an ti bawk a."
17,"And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judæa, and all the region round about.","Chun, chu mipa chungchâng thu chu Judai ram po po le a kâwl vêl ram tinah ân thang suok tah a."
18,And the disciples of John told him of all these things.,"Chun, Johan inchûktirhai chun chuong thu po po chu Johan an hril a."
19,"And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?","Chuongchun, Johan chun a închûktirhai pahni a ko a, Lalpa kuoma chun a tir a, “A hung ding chu i ni, mi dang am kan la ngai ding?” tiin."
20,"And when the men were come unto him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?","Chun, mihai chu a kuom an hung tlung chun, “Baptistu Johanin, ‘A hung ding chu i ni, mi dang am kan la ngai ding?’ ti dingin i kuomah a mi hung tir a nih,” an ta."
21,In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight.,"Chun, chuong lai tak chun Isûn damnaw dâm, hripui invawihai, khawhri imanhai tamtak a sukdam a, mitdel tamtak khawm an mit a sukvar a."
22,"And he answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good tidings preached to them.","Chun, an kuomah, “Fe nâwk ta unla, thil in hmu le in hriet hi Johan va hril ro; mitdelhai an mit a hung var tah, kebaihai kein an lâwn tah, inphârhai an hung inthieng tah, nasêthai an na a hung var tah, mi- thihai keithoin an um tah, pasiehaiin Chanchin Ṭha hril an dawng tah."
23,"And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.","Chun, tûkhawm ka chunga lungninawna hmu naw chu an hamṭha,” a ta, a dawn a."
24,"And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?","Chun, Johan mi tirhai chu an fe hnungin Isûn mipuihai kuoma chun Johan thu a hril tah a, “Ieng en dingin am thlalêra khan in hang feh a? Luong thli imût hnîng maw?"
25,"But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.","Annawleh, ieng en ding takin am in hang feh a? Puon innêm sil maw? Ngai ro, puon innêm sil le mi inhawitirhai chu lal inahai in sawnnaw an um."
26,"But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.","Annawleh, ieng en ding takin am in hang feh a? Zâwlnei maw? A ni ngei kha, ka ti cheu hi, zâwlnei nêk khawma ropui lem,"
27,"This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee.","‘En ta, ka tirko i hmaah ka tir a nih, Ama chun i hmaah i lampui siem a tih,’ ti, a chanchin an iziek kha, ama hi a nih."
28,"I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he.","Nuhmei sûnga insieng laia chun Johan nêka ropui lem an um nawh; nisienlakhawm, Pathien rama mi chîn tak khawm ama nêkin an ropui lem,” a ta."
29,"And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.","Chun, mi po poin an hrietin, siedâwltuhai leh, Johan baptisma lo chang tah an na, Pathien an inthiem a."
30,"But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him.","Pharisaihai le dânhretuhai ruok chu a kuoma baptisma lo chang tah an ni ve nawh a, anni ta dinga Pathienin rem a iruotpêk chu an pawm nawh."
31,"Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?","Chuongchun, Isu bawkin, “Tu- lai ruoltharhai hi ieng lêm hrilkhîng ka tih aw?"
32,"They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep.","Naupang dâwr hmuna ṭhunga, ‘Theihle kan mûtpêk cheu a, in lâm si nawh a; kan ṭap rak a, in ṭap si nawh a,’ tia inkhêkkhumhai ang hi an nih."
33,"For John the Baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.","Baptistu Johan chu a hung a, bei a fâk nawh a, uoin khawm a dâwn nawh a, nangnîn, ‘Khawhri a zâwl a nih,’ in tih a."
34,"The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!","Mihriem Naupa a hung a, a fâkin a dâwn a, ‘En ta u, bu he mi, uoin he mi, siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai ruolpa saw!’ in ti sih a."
35,And wisdom is justified of all her children.,"Nisienlakhawm, Varna chu a nau po poin an inthiem,” a ta."
36,"And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.","Chun, Pharisaihai laia mi pakhatin a kuomah bu fa dingin a fiel a. Chun, Pharisai ina chun a lût a, thlaithlêng a awt a."
37,"And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,","Chun, ngai ta, chu khuoa nu- hmei suol pakhat um chun, Pharisai inah thlaithlêng awtin a ṭhung ti a hriet phingleh alabastar bûrin hriek rim inhnik a hung chawi a."
38,"and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.","A hnungah a kepha bula chun ṭap pumin a ngîr a, a mitthliin a kepha a lo far huh a, a samin a hrûk a, a kepha chu a fâwp a, hriek rim inhnik chun a nâl a."
39,"Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.","Chun, a fieltu Pharisai chun a hmu chun, a lungrilin, “Hi mipa hi zâwlnei a ni chun a themtu nuhmei hi tu am a ni, mi ieng ang am a ni hre âwm tak, mi suol a ni sih a,” a ta."
40,"And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Simon, i kuomah thu bau khat hril ding ka nei,” a ta, a dawn a. Chun, ama chun, “Hril ta la, Inchûktirtu,” a ta."
41,"A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty.","Chun, Isûn “Tangka inpûktirtu tuin amanih leibattu pahni a nei a; pakhatin duli za nga a bat a, pakhatin sâwmnga."
42,"When they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?","Chun, thungna an nei nawh a, a ngaidam ve veh a. Chuongchun, chuhai chun a tû lem chun am ama chu hmangai lem an ta?” a ta."
43,"Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.","Simon chun, “A ingaidam tam lem chun niin ka ring,” a ta, a dawn a. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “I ti dik ie,” a ta."
44,"And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.","Chun, nuhmei tieng chu a nghah a, Simon kuoma chun, “Hi nuhmei hi i hmu? I inah ka hung lût a, nangin ka ke sâwpna ding tui i mi pêk nawh a, ama ruok hin chu a mitthliin ka kepha a sukhuh a, a samin a hrûk a nih."
45,"Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.",Nangin fâwp hrim hrim i mi fâwp nawh; ama ruok hin chu ka hung lût hlima inthawk ka kepha fâwp a ma nawh.
46,My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.,Nangin ka luah hriek i mi nâl nawh; ama ruok hin chu ka kepha hriek rim inhnik a nâl.
47,"Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.","Chuleiin, ka ti che hi, a suol tamtak kha ngaidamin a um tah; ama khawmin a hmangai ta bêk bêk a ni hi; amiruokchu, ngaidam tlâwm chun, tlâwmtêin a hmangai hlak,” a ta."
48,"And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.","Chun, nuhmei kuoma chun, “I suolhai ngaidam a ni tah,” a ta."
49,"And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins?","Chun, a thlaithlêng awtpuihai chun, “Suolhai khawm ngaidam hi tu am a na?” an in tih a."
50,"And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.","Chun, ama chun nuhmei kuoma chun, “I ringna hi sandam I ni pha a nih, thlamuongtakin fe rawh,” a ta."
