1,"Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled.","Chun, Kaisar Augustain khawvêl ram po po hming ziek ding thu a pêk a."

4,"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;","Josef khawm, David sûnghai le a thla a ni leiin, Galili rama Nazareth khuoa inthawka Judai rama David khuo Bethlehem an tia chun a feh a,"

6,"And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered.","Chun, chutaka an um lai chun a naunei chu a hung hun tah a."
7,"And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.","Chun, a nau lutîrah naupasal a nei a; puonin a tuom a, khuolbûkah an inleng ve naw leiin ran bu pêkna thlêngah ân zâltir a."

9,"And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.","Chun, Lalpa vântirko pakhat an kâwlah a hung ngîr a, Lalpa ropuinân an vêl chu a hung sun var a; chuongchun, an ṭi ta bêk bêk a."
10,"And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people:","Chun, vântirko chun an kuomah, “Ṭi naw unla, ngai ro, mi tin ta ding chanchin ṭha lâwmum bêk bêk ka hung intlun cheu a nih."

13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,","Chun, kârloin vântirko kuoma chun vâna mihai mipui an hung um ta huk el a, Pathien an inpâk a,"
14,"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.","“A chunghnungtakah Pathien ropuitakin um raw se, Hnuoi chunga a ilâwm bêk bêk mihriemhai kuomah inremna thu inlêng raw se,” an tih a."
15,"And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.","Chun, vântirkohai chun vân tieng an fe san phingleh, berâm vêngtuhai chun, “Tuhin Bethlehem chenin fe inla, Lalpain thu a mi hril hung tlung chu en ei tiu,” an in tih a."
16,"And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.","Chuongchun, an fe vat vat a, Mari le Josef leh, ran bu pêkna thlênga nautê zâl le chun an hmuh a."
17,"And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.","Chun, an hmu chun nautê chanchin thu vântirkoin a hril kha an hril vêl a."
18,And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds.,"Chun, a hre taphawt chun berâm vêngtuhai thu hril chu mak an ti hleh a."
19,"But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.","Mari ruok chun thu hril po po chu a lungrilin a ngaituoh a, a vawng zing a."
20,"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.","Chun, berâm vêngtuhai chun vântirko hril ang ngeia iengkim an hmua an hriet leiin, Pathien chawimawi le inpâk pei pumin an kîr nâwk tah a."
21,"And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.","Chun, a sertanna ding ni riet a hung tling chun, a hminga chun sula a um hma daia vântirkoin a sak tasa ISU an sak a."
22,"And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord","Chun, Mosie dân anga an inthien ni a hung tlung chun ama chu Jerusalemah an hung ṭhuoi a,"
23,"(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),","Lalpa Dân thua, “Nau lutîr pasal taphawt chu Lalpa ta dinga ruot tîng an tih” ti ziek ang khan,"
24,"and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.","Lalpa kuoma inhlân ding le vaṭhu tuok khat amanih, pârva tê pahni amanih Lalpa Dân thua ziek anga that dingin."
25,"And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.","Chun, ngai ta, Jerusalema chun mi pakhat a hming Simeon a um a; ama chu mi feltak le Pathien ngaisaktak a na; Israel thlamuongtu ding chu a nghâk zing a, a chungah Thlarau Inthieng a um a."
26,"And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.","Chun, Lalpa Krista chu a hmu hmakhat chu thi naw ni ti Thlarau Inthiengin a lo inhriettir ta hrim a."
27,"And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law,","Chun, Thlarau inhriettirin Pathien biekina chun a va lût a; nautê Isu chu a nu le a pain Dân pângngai anga a chunga thawpêk dinga an hung ṭhuoi lût lai chun,"
28,"then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,","ama chun a lo pawm a, Pathien ân pâk a;"
29,"Now lettest thou thy servant depart, Lord, According to thy word, in peace;","“Lalpa, tuhin i thu ang peiin i suok hi thlamuongtakin în fetir ding a na;"
30,"For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,","I sandamna chu ka mitin a hmu tah a,"
31,Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;,Mi tin mithmua I siem kha;
32,"A light for revelation to the Gentiles, And the glory of thy people Israel.","Jentailhai kuoma suklangna var le I mi Israelhai ropuina ding chu,” a ta."
33,And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him;,"Chun, nautê thu a hril chu a nu le a pa chun mak an ti hleh a."
34,"and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against;","Chun, Simeon chun mal a sâwmpêk a, a nu Mari kuomah, “Ngai rawh, hi naupang hi Israel lai mi tamtak tlûkna ding le ngîrsuokna dinga ruot a nih, mi isawisêl ding inchikna ni bawk dingin:"
35,yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.,"anih, nanga lungril khawm ngûnhnâmin la sun thleng a tih, mi tamtakin an lungrila an ngaituohai chu ân langna dingin,” a ta."
36,"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,","Chun, mi pakhat zâwlnei Anna, Phanuel naunu, Aser hnama mi a um a. Ama chu tartak a na, a nunghâk mâka inthawk a pasal leh kum sari a um a."
37,"and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day.",Kum sâwmriet pali zet hmei- thaiin a um a. Ama chun Pathien biekin fesan loin asûn azâna bu nghei dâma ṭawngṭaiin Pathien a biek hlak a.
38,"And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.","Chun, chu lai tak chun ama chu a hung a, Pathien kuomah lâwmthu a hril a, Jerusalem intlan beiseihai taphawt kuoma chun Isu chanchin a hril a."
39,"And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.","Chun, Lalpa dân ang peia thil po po an thaw zoin, Galili rama anni khuo Nazaretha chun an kîr nâwk tah a."
40,"And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.","Chun, nautê chu a hung inṭhang lien deu deu a, a hung hrât deu deu a, varnain a sip tah a, Pathien lunginsietna a chungah a um bawk a."
41,And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.,"Chun, kum tinin Fekân Ruoiṭhe hunin a nu le pa chu Jerusalemah an fe hlak a."
42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;",Ama chu kum sâwmpahni a niin ruoiṭhe dân pângngaiin an hang feh a.
43,"and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not;","An ṭumṭieka an hung chun, naupang Isu chun Jerusalemah a um san tah a; a nu le pa chun an hriet si nawh a."
44,"but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance:","An intlawnpuihai lai a um ve zing amanih an ta, ni khat lam zet an fe tah a, an laibunghai le an hmêlhriethai lai an zawng a."
45,"and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.","Chun, an hmu naw leiin zawng pei pumin Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a."
46,"And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions:","Chun, ni thum chena chun, Pathien biekinah, inchûktirtuhai laia ṭhungin, an thu lo ngai a, lo indawnin an hmu tah a."
47,and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.,"Chun, a thu hre taphawt chun a hrietzie le a dawnzie chu mak an ti hleh a."
48,"And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.","Chun, a nu le pa chun ama an hmu chun mak an ti hleh a, chuongchun, a nu chun a kuomah, “Ka nau, iengdinga hienga i mi thaw? Ngai ta, i pa le keiin thlaphângtakin kan zawng che a nih,” a ta."
49,"And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in my Father’s house?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga in mi zawng am a na? Ka pa ina ka um ding in hriet naw am a nih?” a ta."
50,And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.,"Chun, an kuoma a thu hril chu a ngaina an hriet nawh a."
51,"And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.","Chun, anni chu a zui thlâk a, Nazareth chu a hung tlung a, an thu zâwmin a um a. Chun, a nu chun chuong thil po po chu a lungrilah a vawng zing a."
52,"And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.","Chun, Isu chu a var deu deu a, a hung lien deu deu a, Pathien le mihriem ditsakin a um deu deu a."
