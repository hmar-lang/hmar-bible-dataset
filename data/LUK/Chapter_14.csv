1,"And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.","Chun, Châwlniin Pharisai hotu pakhat ina bu fa dinga a fe laiin, an enthlit a."
2,"And behold, there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy.","Chun, ngai ta, a hmaa chun damnaw invûng mi tû amanih a um a."
3,"And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not?","Chuongchun, Isûn Dân inchûk- tirtuhai le Pharisaihai chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Châwlni hin sukdam a thieng am a thieng naw?” a ta."
4,"But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.","Anni ruok chu an to zing a; ama chun damnaw chu a chel a, a sukdam a, ân fetir tah a."
5,"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day?","Chun, an kuomah, “Nangni lai in sabengtung amanih, sebâwng ama- nih, tuisunsuoah lo tla sien la, Châwlni khawmin tûin am kei suok nghâl nâwng in ta?” a ta."
6,And they could not answer again unto these things.,Chuong thu chu an dawn thei naw nâwk bawk a.
7,"And he spake a parable unto those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them,","Chun, an mi fielhaiin ṭhungpha ṭhatak an thlang hlakzie a hmuh a, an kuomah tekhithu a hril tah a;"
8,"When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him,","“Inneina ruoiṭhe fa dingin tûin amanih a fiel pha che chun ṭhungpha ṭhatakah ṭhung naw rawh; chuong naw chun, i nêka mi ṭha lem lo fiel hlau a ta,"
9,"and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place.","chuongchun, a fieltu che chun, ‘Hi pa ṭhungna ding hi inkien rawh,’ hung tîng a cheh a; chun, nang inzaktakin ṭhungpha ṭha nawtakah i ṭhung nâwk si ding a nih."
10,"But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee.","An fiel che chun ṭhungpha ṭha naw takah va ṭhung lem hlak rawh; chuongchun, a fieltu che a hung pha leh, i kuomah, ‘Ruola, ṭhungpha ṭha deua hin hung ṭhung rawh,’ ti thei a ti che. Chuongchun, i thlaithlêng awt- puihai mithmua chun chawimawiin um i tih."
11,For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.,"Inngaihlu taphawt chu tlâwm an ta; inngaitlâwm chu chawimawiin um an tih,” a ta."
12,"And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee.","Chun, a fieltu kuoma khawm chun, “Sûna manih, zâna manih ruoi i ṭhe pha leh, i ruolhai, i unauhai, i laibunghai, i vêng hausahai chu fiel naw rawh; chuong naw chun, fiel ve nâwk an ti cheh a, thung nâwk kher an ti che."
13,"But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:","Ruoi i ṭhe pha chun, pasiehai, piengsuolhai, keinbaihai, mitdelhai fiel lem rawh;"
14,and thou shalt be blessed; because they have not wherewith to recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just.,"chuongchun, la hamṭhâng i tih; anni chun thungna ding che nei naw ni hai a, chuongchun, mi fel tho nâwk pha chun thungin i um ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
15,"And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.","Chun, a thlaithlêng awtpui tûin amanih chuong chu a hriet a, a kuomah, “Pathien rama bu fa ding chu a hamṭha ie!” a ta."
16,"But he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade many:","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Mi tûin amanih ruoi ropuitak zânah a ṭheh a, mi tamtak a fiel a;"
17,"and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.","chun, a fâk huna chun a mi fielhai kuomah, ‘Hung ta ro khai, tuhin iengkim inzo a ni tah,’ ti dingin a suok a tir a."
18,"And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out and see it; I pray thee have me excused.","Chun, an rêngin inthuruolin suonlam an siem seng a. A hmasatak chun a kuomah, ‘Lo kân châwk tah a, a ena ka fe a ṭûl a nih; mi lunginsiet la mi hung inphatpêk rawh,’ a ta."
19,"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused.","Chun, mi dangin, ‘Sebâwng tuok nga kân châwk tah a, a sie le ṭha fie dingin ka fe ding a na, mi lungin- siet la mi hung inphatpêk rawh,’ a ta."
20,"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.","Chun, mi dangin, ‘Nuhmei ka nei tah a, chuleiin, ka hung thei nawh,’ a ta."
21,"And the servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame.","Chun, suok chun a pu kuomah chuong thu chu a va hril a. Chun, in neitu chu a lunginsen a, a suok kuom- a chun, ‘Suok la, kawtthlêrahai, kâwmkârahai, fe zeu zuou la, pasie- hai, piengsuolhai, mitdelhai, kein- baihai, hitaka hin hung ṭhuoi lût rawh,’ a ta."
22,"And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet there is room.","Chun, suok chun, ‘Pu i thu mi pêk ang khan ka thaw tah a, nisien- lakhawm, hmun a la chuong ta rawp,’ a ta."
23,"And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain them to come in, that my house may be filled.","Chun, a puin suok kuoma chun, ‘Suok la, lamlienahai, khawhnâwma- hai fe la, ka in sipna dingin mî hung thlêm lût hrâm rawh."
24,"For I say unto you, that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper.","Ka hril che hi, mi ka ifielhai khan pakhat khawmin ka ruoiṭhe fa naw ni hai,’ a tih a,” a ta."
25,"Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said unto them,","Chun, mipui nasatak ama leh an fe veh a; chuongchun, ama chu a nghah a, an kuomah,"
26,"If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.","“Tûkhawm ka kuoma hung chun a pa dâm, a nu dâm, a nuhmei dâm, a nauhai, a unauhai, a farnuhai, ama hringna chenin a theida naw chun, ka închûktir ni thei naw ni."
27,"Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.","Tûkhawm mâni kraws puta mi zui naw chu, ka închûktir ni thei naw ni."
28,"For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have wherewith to complete it?","“Nangni laia tûkhawm hin in insâng bâwl tum unla, a tirin ṭhungin, bâwl zona khawp sum in nei le nei naw hre dingin, a man ding chin tuin am sût nâwng in ta?"
29,"Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him,","Chuong naw chun, lung phûm ta zeta a bâwl zo thei si naw chun, a en taphawtin nuisan an ta,"
30,"saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.","‘Hi mipa hin in ân kal zet a, a bâwl zo thei si nawh a,’ tîng an tih."
31,"Or what king, as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?","“Chun, lal tûin am lal dang hung chu, mi sîng khat le a tuok ngam ding le ding naw, mi râwn nâwng a ta?"
32,"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace.","Chuong a ni naw leh, lal dang chu hlataka a la um laiin, inremna tieng thutiem hni dingin palai tir a tih."
33,"So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.","Chuong ang bawkin, nangni lai hin tûkhawm a nei po po mâksan naw chu, ka închûktir ni thei naw nih."
34,"Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?","“Machi hi a ṭha; nisienla- khawm, machi khawm a da ta chun, iengin am sukal nâwk an ta?"
35,"It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill: men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.","Leihnuoi dingin ṭha naw nih a, êkdûr dingin ṭha bawk naw nih; mîn an peihâwn hlak. Tûkhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
