2,And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people.,"Chun, thiempu lal le Dân inchûktirtuhai chun a sukhlumnazie an zawng a, vântlâng an ṭi sih a."
3,"And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.","Chun, sâwm le pahnihai laia ṭhang, Juda Iskariot an iti sûnga chun Setan a lût a."
4,"And he went away, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto them.","Chuongchun, ama chu a va feh a, an kuomah ân mantir theina dingzie thiempu lalhai le hotuhai chu a va râwn a."
5,"And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.","Anni chu an lâwm hleh a, tangka pêk an tiem tah a."
6,"And he consented, and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude.","Ama chun a remtih a, mipui umnaw kâra inmantirna remchâng a zawng tah a."
7,"And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must be sacrificed.","Chun, Chawlṭhanglo Bei ruoiṭhe ni, Fekân Ruoiṭhena berâmte thatna ding ni chu a hung tlung tah a."
8,"And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat.","Chuongchun, Isûn Peter le Johan chu, “Fekân Ruoi bu ei fâk dingin va buotsai ro,” a ta."
9,"And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we make ready?","Anni chun a kuomah, “Khâwlai am va buotsai inlang i nuom a?” an ta."
10,"And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Ngai ta u, khawpuia in lûtin, pasal bêla tui putin intuokpui a ti cheu a, a lûtna inah zui lût el ro."
11,"And ye shall say unto the master of the house, The Teacher saith unto thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?","Chun, in neitupa kuoma chun, ‘Inchûktirtuin, ka închûktirhai le Fekân Ruoi bu kan fâkna ding mikhuol pindan chu khâwlai am a na? a ti che,’ ti ro."
12,And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.,"Chuongchun, ama chun pindan chunghnung lientak, thuomhnaw umsa inentir a ti cheu a; chutaka chun buotsai ro,” a ta."
13,"And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.","Chun, an fe tah a, an kuoma a hril ang takin an hmuh a; chun, Fekân Ruoi chu an buotsai tah a."
14,"And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him.","Chun, a fâk a hung hun chun, ama chun thlêng a awt a, a tirkohai chun an awtpui veh a."
15,"And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:","Chun, an kuomah, “Ka thil tuor hma hin hi Fekân Ruoi hi fâkpui cheu ka nuom bêk bêk a nih."
16,"for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.","Ka hril cheu hi, hi hi Pathien rama sukfamkim a ni hmakhat chu ka fâk nâwk ta naw ding a nih,” a ta."
17,"And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:","Chun, no a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin, “Hi hi la unla, insem ro,"
18,"for I say unto you, I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.","ka hril cheu hi, tuta inthawk Pathien ram a hung tlung hmakhat chu grêp hrui raa hi ka dâwn nâwk ta naw ding a nih,” a ta."
19,"And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.","Chun, bei a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin, a khawi a, an kuomah a pêk a, “Hi hi ka taksa [in aia pêk chu a nih; in mi hriet zingna dingin hi hi thaw hlak ro,” a ta."
20,"And the cup in like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, even that which is poured out for you.","Chun, zân bu fâk zoin chuong ang bawkin no chu a lâk a, “Hi no hi ka thisena thuthlung thar chu a nih, in aia suok ding chu.]"
21,"But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.","“Nisienlakhawm, ngai ta u, a mîn mantirtu ding kut chu ka kuom- ah dawkân chungah a um zing a nih."
22,"For the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed!","Mihriem Naupa hi ruot ang ngeiin a fe ding a nih; nisienla- khawm, ân mantirtu ding mihriem chung chu a rik ie!” a ta."
23,"And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.","Chun, annin, “Eini laia thil chuong ang thaw ding chu tû am nîng ei ta le?” an ta, anni le anni an indawn a."
24,"And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest.","Chun, anni laia tû tak am ropui taka ngai ding ti thuah insêlna a suok a."
25,"And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Jentailhai lalhai chu an chungah an inlal hlak a; an chunga thuneituhai chu, ‘Thilṭha thawtu’ tia ko an ni hlak."
26,"But ye shall not be so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.","Nisienlakhawm, nangni chu chuong ang chu ni naw ti niu; in laia ropui tak chu a chîn lem angin um sienla, ân lal tak chu rawngbâwltu angin um lem raw se."
27,"For which is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.","Tû am a ropui lem a? Bu fatu am, rawngbâwltu? Bu fatu chu a ni naw am a nih? Nisienlakhawm, kei chu nangni laia rawngbâwltu angin ka um hi."
28,But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations;,“Rinum ka tuok sûng po nangni a mi umpuituhai in na;
29,"and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me,","ka Pain ram a mi ruotpêk angin ram ka ruotpêk cheu hi,"
30,that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.,"chuongchun, ka rama ka daw- kâna in fâka in dâwn theina dingin; chuongchun, Israel hnam sâwmpa- hnihai ro rêlpêkin lalṭhungphaah la ṭhung in tih."
31,"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat:","“Simon, Simon, ngai ta, Setan- in, bu rel anga a rel theina ding cheuin, nangni rawi hi a hni cheu annaw;"
32,"but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren.","nisienlakhawm, i ringna a bo nawna dingin ka ṭawngṭaipêk che a nih, i ngha kîr nâwk pha nangin i unauhai sukdet rawh,” a ta."
33,"And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, intângna ina le thinaa khawm i kuoma fe ve ka huom a nih,” a ta."
34,"And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.","Ama chun, “Peter, ka hril che hi, i mi hrietnaa hin vawi thum i mîn phat hmakhat chu vawisûn hin âr khuong naw ni,” a ta."
35,"And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.","Chun, an kuomah, “Tangka ip boa, mansa boa, kekawk boa ka tir suok cheu khan thil hrim hrim in tlasam am?” a ta. Anni chun, “Tlasam lo,” an ta."
36,"And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Tu ruok hin chu tûkhawm tangka ip nei chun chawi raw se, mansa leh; tûkhawm kâwlhnâm nei naw chun a puon zawr sienla inchaw raw se."
37,"For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment.","Ka hril cheu hi, ‘Ama chu mi suol lai an tiem sa tah,’ ti ziek kha ka chungah a hung tlung ding a nih; ka chungchâng thuhai kha a tlung zo ding a ni tah,” a ta."
38,"And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.","Chun, anni chun, “Lalpa, en ta, hi kâwlhnâm pahni a um,” an ta. Ama chun an kuomah, “A hun chu,” a ta."
39,"And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.","Chun, ama chu a suok a, a dân pângngaiin Oliv tlânga chun a fe tah a; inchûktirhai khawmin an zui a."
40,"And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.","Chun, a hmun chu a va tlung chun an kuomah, “Thlêmnaa in lût nawna dingin ṭawngṭai ro,” a ta."
41,"And he was parted from them about a stone’s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed,","Chun, lung dêng phâk chenah a tumin a va feh a; chun, a dingṭha- ṭhuon a, a ṭawngṭai a,"
42,"saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.","“Pa, rem i ti chun, hi no hi ka kuoma inthawkin la hmang rawh; nisienlakhawm, keia thu ni loin, nangma thu thu ni lem raw se,” a ta."
43,"And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.","[Chun, vâna inthawkin vântir- ko pakhat a sukhar dingin a hung inlâr a."
44,And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.,"Chun, a lung ân rim bêk bêk leiin ṭhahnemngai nâwk zuolin a ṭawngṭai a, a thlan chu thi far lientak angin, hnuoiah a zuk far a.]"
45,"And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,","Chun, a ṭawngṭai zoa a thoin, inchûktirhai kuomah a hung a, an lungngai leiin an lo in a hmuh a;"
46,"and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.","chun, an kuomah, “Iengdinga in in am? Thlêmnaa in lût nâwna dingin tho unla, ṭawngṭai ro,” a ta."
47,"While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.","Chun, a la hril zing laiin, ngai ta, mipui an hung a, sâwm le pahni laia ṭhang Juda an iti khan an hma a hung ṭhuoi a; chun, fâwp tumin Isu a hung pan a."
48,"But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?","Nisienlakhawm, Isu chun a kuomah, “Juda, Mihriem Naupa hi fâwpin în mantir ding a ni maw?” a ta."
49,"And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?","Chun, a vêla mihai chun thil hung tlung ding chu an hrietin, “Lalpa kâwlhnâmin sât kan ti?” an ta."
50,"And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.","Chun, anni laia tûin amanih Thiempu Laltak suok chu a sât a, a nakâwr chang tieng a sât thlâkpêk a."
51,"But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye them thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.","Chun, Isûn a biek a, “Hi po hi ni raw se,” a ta, a nakâwr chu a them a, a sukdam tah a."
52,"And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?","Chun, Isûn a kuoma hung thiempu lalhai, Pathien biekin hotu- hai le, upahai kuoma chun, “Kâwl- hnâmhai, hembâwkhai chawiin, suomhmang man ding ang elin in hung a ni maw?"
53,"When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.","Pathien biekina in kuoma ni tin ka um laihai khan mi man tumin in mi ban si nawh a; nisienlakhawm, tuhi nangni hun a nih, inthim thuneina leh,” a ta."
54,"And they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.","Chun, an man a, an ṭhuoi a, Thiempu Laltak ina chun an ṭhuoi lût tah a."
55,"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.","Chun, Peterin hlataka inthawk- in a zui a. Chun, in inhuon sûng tuollai chun mei an sêm a, an ṭhung khâwm a, Peter chu anni lai a va ṭhung veh a."
56,"And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him.","Chun, mei vara a ṭhung laiin, nunghâk tûin amanih a hmuh a, a en zing a, “Hi mipa khawm hi a kuoma um kha a ni hi,” a tih a."
57,"But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.","Ama ruok chun, “Nuhmei, ama chu ka hriet nawh,” tiin ân phat a."
58,"And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.","Chun, anakie deu chun mi dangin a hung hmu nâwk a, “Nang khawm anni laia mi i ni hi,” a ta. Peter ruok chun, “Mihriem, ka ni nawh ie,” a ta."
59,"And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilæan.","Chun, dâr kâr khat lai hnunga chun, mi dangin, “Hi mipa khawm hi a kuoma um kha a ni ngei el; Galili ram mi a nih annâwm,” a ti tlat a."
60,"But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.","Chun, Peterin, “Mihriem, i thu hril chu ka hriet nawh,” a ta. Chun, kârloin, a ṭawng laitak chun âr a khuong nghâl tah a."
61,"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.","Chun, Lalpa chu a nghah a, Peter chu a en a. Peter chun Lalpain, “Vawisûn hin âr a khuong hmain vawi thum mîn phat i tih,” a kuoma a ti thu kha a hung hriet dawk nâwk tah a."
62,"And he went out, and wept bitterly.","Chun, a suok a, a ṭap ta ngawi ngawi a."
63,"And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and beat him.","Chun, Isu cheltuhai chun nuiza siemnân an hmang a, an vuok a."
64,"And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee?","Chun, a mit an tuom a, “Hril rawh, tûin am a vuok cheh a?” tiin an indawn hlak a."
65,"And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.",Thu dang tamtak khawmin an hrilsietin an hal a.
66,"And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying,","Chun, khawvar phingleh, vântlâng upahai, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chu an inrâwn khâwm a, an rorêlnaa chun an ṭhuoi a;"
67,"If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:","“Krista i ni tak zet chun mi hril rawh,” an tih a. Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Hril lang cheu khawm awi naw ti niu;"
68,"and if I ask you, ye will not answer.",indawn lang cheu khawm dawn naw ti niu.
69,But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God.,"Nisienlakhawm, tuta inthawk chu Mihriem Naupa hi Pathien thil- thawtheina changtieng ṭhung tâng a tih,” a ta."
70,"And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.","Chun, an rêngin, “Nang hi Pathien Naupa chu i ni am a nih?” an ta. Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Ka nih ti in hril zing chu teh,” a ta."
71,"And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.","Chun, anni chun, “Ieng hrietna dang am ngai tâng ei ta? Eini ngeiin ama bau suok ei hriet tah annâwm,” an ta."
