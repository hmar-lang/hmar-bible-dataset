1,Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him.,"Chun, siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai po poin a thu hre dingin a kuom an hung pan a."
2,"And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.","Chun, Pharisaihai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chun, “Hi mipa hin mi suolhai a pâwl a, an kuoma hai bu a fâk ve hlak,” tiin an chier ve veh a."
3,"And he spake unto them this parable, saying,","Chuongchun, ama chun an kuomah hi tekhithu hi a hril a;"
4,"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?","“Nangni lai tûkhawmin berâm za nei sienla, an laia pakhat inhmang ang sienla, thlalêrah sâwmkuo le pakuohai chu mâksanin ân hmang chu a hmu nâwk hmakhat tûin am zawng nâwng a ta?"
5,"And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.","Chun, a hmu nâwk chun, lâwmtakin a liengkoah a put hlak."
6,"And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and his neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.","Chun, in a tlung phingleh a ruolhai le a vênghai a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, ‘Mi lâwmpui ro, ka berâm inhmang kha ka hmu nâwk tah ie,’ a ti hlak."
7,"I say unto you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance.","Ka hril cheu hi, chuong ang bawk chun, mi fel sâwmkuo le pakuo sim chuong ding nei nawhai chunga nêkin mi suol pakhat sim chunga hin vânah lâwmna um lem a tih."
8,"Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?","“Chun, nuhmei tûkhawm duli sâwm neiin pakhat inhmang ang sienla, khâwnvar insita, in phîtin, a hmu nâwk hmakhat chu nguntakin tûin am zawng nâwng a ta?"
9,"And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.","Chun, a hmu nâwk chun, a ruolhai le a vênghai a ko khâwm a, ‘Mi lâwmpui ro, ka duli inhmang kha ka hmu nâwk tah,’ a ti hlak."
10,"Even so, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.","Ka hril cheu hi, chuong ang bawkin, mi suol pakhat sim chunga hin Pathien vântirkohai an lâwm hlak a nih."
11,"And he said, A certain man had two sons:",“Mi tûin amanih naupasal pahni a nei a;
12,"and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of thy substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.","chun, a naupang lem chun a pa kuomah, ‘Pa, ro ka chanâi mi pe rawh,’ a ta. Chuongchun, a sum chu an kuomah a sem tah a."
13,"And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living.","Chun, ni sâwt nawtê hnunga chun a naupa naupang lem chun a chanâi po po chu a lâk khâwm vawng a, khaw ram hlatakah a fe tah a, chutaka chun inhawi taluoin a um a, a sum chu a sukthâm ta mei mei a."
14,"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.","Chun, a sukthâm vawng phing- leh, chu khuoa chun ṭâm nasatak a hung tla a; fâk ding a hung tlasam tah a."
15,And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.,"Chuongchun, chu ram mi-mi pakhat a va bêl a; chu mipa chun vawk bu pe dingin a lo tieng a tir a."
16,And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.,"Chun, iengkhat kâwm vawkin an fâkhai chun insukkhawp a nuom bêk bêk a; tukhawmin iengkhawm an pêk si nawh."
17,"But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!","“Chun, ân hriet suok phingleh, ‘Ka pa kuoma inhlâwfahai bu fâk sêng loa nei an tam vei leh, kei hlak chu hitaka hin phîngṭâmin ka thi ding a ni sih a!"
18,"I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight:","Tho ka ta, ka pa kuomah fêng ka ta, Pa, vâna mi chunga le nanga mithmuin thil ka suksuol a."
19,I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.,"I naupaa înbûk tlâk khawm ka ni ta nawh; i kuoma inhlâwfa pakhat angin mi siem ve rawh, tîng ka tih,’ a ta."
20,"And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.","“Chuongchun, a tho a, a pa kuomah a fe tah a. Chuongchun, hlataka a la um laiin a pain a lo hmuh a, a lunginsiet bêk bêk a, a tlân a, a kuoh a, a fâwp ta ngâwi ngâwi a."
21,"And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son.","Chun, a kuomah a naupa chun, ‘Pa, vâna mi chungah le nanga mithmuin thil ka suksuol a; i naupaa inbûk tlâk ka ni ta nawh,’ a ta."
22,"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:","Nisienlakhawm, a pa chun a suokhai kuomah, ‘Puon ṭha tak kha hung la vat unla, insiltir ro; a kutah kutsebi dâm, a keah kekawk dâm inbuntir ro;"
23,"and bring the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and make merry:","sebâwngte thâu tak kha hung la unla, that ro, hlimtakin fâng ei tiu;"
24,"for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.","hi ka naupa hi a thih a, a hung hring nâwk tah a ni hi; ân hmang a, ei hmu nâwk tah a ni hi,’ a ta. Chuong- chun, hlimtakin an um ṭan tah a."
25,"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.","“Chun, a naupa upa lem chu loah a um a; chun, in a hung tlung tâwm chun iengkhat mûtrîk le lâm ri a hriet tah a."
26,"And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be.","Chuongchun, siehlaw pakhat a ko a, ‘Chu ieng am a ni ta leh?’ tiin ân dawn a."
27,"And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘I sang a hung a, himtaka a hmu nâwk leiin i pain sebâwngtê thâutak kha a that a nih,’ a ta."
28,"But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him.","Chun, a lunginsen a, a lût nuom ta nawh a; chun, a pa a hung suok a, a thlêm a."
29,"But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a commandment of thine; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a pa kuomah, ‘Ngai rawh, kum hieng chen hi i rawng ka bâwlpêk cheh a, i thu hlak hi ka awi naw ngai si nawh a, ka ruolhai le hlimna ka siemna dingin kêltê khawm i mi pêk ngai si nawh."
30,"but when this thy son came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf.","Nisienlakhawm, hi i naupa nawchizawrhai kâwla i sum fa zo vawngtu hi a hung phingleh ama ta dingin sebâwngtê thâutak kha i lo thatpêk vei a,’ a ta, a dawn a."
31,"And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, ‘Ka naupa, ka kuoma um zing i nih annâwm; ka nei po po hi i ta a nih."
32,"But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.","Hlimtak le lâwmtaka um ding a ni hrim annâwm; hi i sang hi a thih a, a hung hring nâwk tah a; ân hmang a, ei hmu nâwk tah a ni sih a,’ a tih a,” a ta."
