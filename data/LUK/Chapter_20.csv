1,"And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders;","Chun, ni khat chu, Pathien biekina mihai ân chûktir a, Chanchin Ṭha a hril laiin, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chu, upahai leh a kuomah an hung thut a;"
2,"and they spake, saying unto him, Tell us: By what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?","a kuomah, “Tû thuin am hieng thil hi i thawh a? Tûin am thu a pêk cheh a? mi hril rawh,” tiin an indawn a."
3,"And he answered and said unto them, I also will ask you a question; and tell me:","Ama chun an kuomah, “Kei khawmin thu bau khat indawn vêng ka ti cheu: mi hril ro,"
4,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?","Johan baptisma kha vâna mi thu am, mihriem thu?” a ta, ân dawn a."
5,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why did ye not believe him?","Chun, an inngaituoh a, “ ‘Vâna mi thu,’ ei ti chun, ‘Iengdinga a thu in awi naw?,’ mi ti sîng a ta."
6,"But if we shall say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.","Chun, ‘Mihriem thu,’ ei ti chun, mi po poin lungin mi dêng an tih; Johan chu zâwlnei a ni an ring sih a,” an ta."
7,"And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.","Chuongchun, an dawn a, “Khâw- tieng lem thu am a ni kan hriet nawh,” an ta."
8,"And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kei khawmin, tû thuin am hieng thil hi ka thaw a, hril bîk naw ning cheu,” a ta."
9,"And he began to speak unto the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time.","Chun, vântlâng kuomah hi tekhithu hi a hril tah a; “Tûin amanih grêp huon a siem a, lo enkawltuhai kuomah thlohlaw dingin a pêk a, sâwttak thang dingin ram dangah a fe tah a."
10,"And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.","A lo hun chun huona ra chu a chanâi an lo pêk dingin lo enkawl- tuhai kuoma chun suok pakhat a tir a; nisienlakhawm, lo enkawltuhai chun an lo vuok a, kutruokin an infetir nâwk tah a."
11,"And he sent yet another servant: and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty.","Chun, suok dang a tir nâwk a; chu khawm chu an vuok nâwk bawk a, inzakumtakin an siem a, kutruok bawkin an infetir nâwk tah a."
12,"And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth.","Chun, a pathumna a tir nâwk a; chu khawm chu an lo suksil a, an pei suok tah a."
13,"And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him.","“Chun, grêp huon neitupa chun, ‘Iengtin am thâwng ka ta? Ka naupa dittak tir el ka tih; ama hi an lo inza duoiin,’ a ta."
14,"But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.","Nisienlakhawm, lo enkawltuhai chun ama chu an hmu phingleh, ‘Ama hi rohluotu ding chu a nih, that ei tiu; chuongchun, a ro chu ei ta nîng a tih,’ tiin an inrâwn a."
15,"And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?","Chuongchun, grêp huona in- thawk chu an the suok a, an sukhlum tah a. Grêp huon neitupa chun an chungah iengtin am hung thâwng a ta?"
16,"He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.","Lo enkawltuhai chu hung sukbohmang a ta, huon chu mi danghai pêng a tih,” a ta. Chun, chu chu an hrietin, “Chuong êm chu tlung naw raw se!” an ta."
17,"But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner?","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun anni chu a en a, “Hi thu an ziek hi ieng am a na? ‘In bâwltuhai lung dit naw kha, Chu ngei chu a kia lung ṭhangkai tak a lo ni tah,’ ti hi."
18,"Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.","Tûkhawm chu lung chunga tlu taphawt chu kawi dar a ta; a del lem chu râwt nawi a tih,” a ta."
19,And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.,"Chun, chuong lai tak chun Dân inchûktirtuhai le thiempu lalhaiin man an tum a; nisienlakhawm, mipui chu an ṭih a; chu tekhithu chu anni demin a hril ti an hriet sih a."
20,"And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.","Chun, ama chu Bawrsâp rorêlna le thuneinaa pêk dingin, a thu hril suol la dingin an inchân zing a, enthlittu, mi ṭha anga inlang tehlêmhai chu an tir a."
21,"And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person of any, but of a truth teachest the way of God:","Anni chun a kuomah, “Inchûk- tirtu, indiktakin thu i hrilin în chûktir a, tûkhawm thlier bîk loin, thaw taktakin Pathien kawng thu în chûktir hlak ti kan hriet a;"
22,"Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?","Kaisar kuoma sie kan chawi a thieng am a thieng naw?” an ta, an indawn a."
23,"But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them,","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an dâwp a nih ti a hriet a, an kuomah,"
24,"Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Cæsar’s.","“Duli mîn entir ro,” a ta. “Tû lim le tu hming am a na a chuong hi?” a ta. Anni chun, “Kaisar,” an ta."
25,"And he said unto them, Then render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Kaisar thilhai chu Kaisar kuomah pe unla, Pathien thilhai chu Pathien kuomah pe ta unla,” a ta."
26,"And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.","Chuongchun, mipui hmaah a thu hril suol lâk ding an hmu nawh a; a dawnna chu mak an ti hleh a, an to zing a."
27,"And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection;","Chun, Saddukai, thonâwkna a um nawh tihai laia mi tuhai amanih a kuomah an hung a, a kuomah,"
28,"and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.","“Inchûktirtu, Mosien, tûkhawm a unaupain nuhmei nei sienla, nau nei loin thi sienla, a unaupa chun a nuhmei chu hluoin, a unaupa ta dingin chi a thlapêk ding a nih ti a mi ziekpêk a nih."
29,"There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless;","Âwle, sal sari an um a; a upatakin nuhmei a nei a, nau nei loin a thi tah a."
30,and the second:,A pahnina chun a hluoh a; nau nei lo bawkin a thi tah a;
31,"and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.",a pathumna chun a hluo nâwk a; chuong ang sengin pasarihai chu nau nei loin an thi pei a.
32,Afterward the woman also died.,Chu hnunga chun nuhmei khawm chu a thi tah a.
33,In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.,"Chuongchun, thonâwk pha chun a tû nuhmei tak am nîng a ta? an pasari chun nuhmeiin an nei seng sih a,” tiin an indawn a."
34,"And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage:","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Tulai mihai hi nuhmei pasal an innei hlak;"
35,"but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:","nisienlakhawm, chuong phaa ṭhang tlâk le mithi laia inthawka thonâwknaa ṭhang tlâka ruot taphawthai chu, nuhmei pasal innei ta naw ni hai,"
36,"for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.","thi khawm thi nâwk thei ta naw ni hai, vântirkohai tlukin an um ding a ni sih a; thonâwkna nauhai an ni leiin Pathien nauhai nîng an tih."
37,"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the place concerning the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.","Mithi keithoin an um ding a nih ti Mosie khawmin Chîmbuk thuah Lalpa chu, ‘Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien, Jakob Pathien,’ a ti lai khan ân hriettir kha."
38,"Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.","Ama chu mithi Pathien a ni nawh a, mi hring Pathien a ni lem ie; amaa chun mi po po an hring vawng sih a,” a ta."
39,"And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.","Dân inchûktirtu tuhaiin ama- nih, “Inchûktirtu, i hril indik ngawt el!” an ta, an dawn a."
40,For they durst not any more ask him any question.,Thu dang an indawn ngam ta si nawh a.
41,"And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David’s son?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Krista chu David naupa a nih ti iengtiziea ti hlak am an na?"
42,"For David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,","Inpâkna Hla buah David ngeiin, ‘Lalpa chun ka Lalpa kuomah, Ka changtieng ṭhung rawh,"
43,Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.,"I hmêlmahai chu i ke innghatnaa ka siem hmakhat chun,’ a ti a, a ta."
44,"David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?","Chuongchun, David chun ama chu, ‘Lalpa,’ a ti sih a, iengtin am, a naupa a ni thei leh?” a ta."
45,"And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,","Chun, mi po po hrietin a închûk- tirhai kuomah, “Dân inchûktirtuhai lai chun fîmkhur ro;"
46,"Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts;","anni chun zakaw infuol hâka lêng an nuom hlak, dâwr hmuna chi- bai bûkhai, inkhâwmna ina ṭhung- pha ṭhatakhai, ruoiṭhenaah hmun ṭha takhai an ngaina hlak a;"
47,"who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.","hmeithai sum an fâk a, tlâng hlêmna dingin sâwt tak an ṭawngṭai hlak; chuonghai chun thiemnaw chang nasa zuol an tih,” a ta."
