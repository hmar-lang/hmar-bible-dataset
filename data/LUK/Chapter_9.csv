1,"And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.","Chun, Isûn sâwm le pahnihai chu a ko khâwm a, khawhri po po chunga thilthawtheina le thuneina le natnahai sukdam theina a pêk a."
2,"And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.","Chuongchun, Pathien ram thu hril ding le, damnawhai sukdam dingin a tir suok tah a."
3,"And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.","Chun, an kuomah, “Inzinnaa dingin hmawl amanih, mansa ama- nih, bei amanih, tangka amanih, iengkhawm chawi naw ro; zakuo pahni khawm nei naw ro."
4,"And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.","Chun, in tlungna in taphawtah tlung zing pei unla, chu ina inthawk chun suok ro."
5,"And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.","Chun, a lâwm naw taphawt cheu chu, chu khuoa inthawka in suok pha chun an thiemnawzie inhriettirna dingin in kephaa pilvut chu thin thla ro,” a ta."
6,"And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.","Chuongchun, an fe tah a, khuo an fang pei a, ram tinah Chanchin Ṭha an hril a, mi an sukdam pei a."
7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;","Chun, lal Herod chun a thilthaw po po chu a lo hrietin a lunginzîng tah a, ṭhenkhatin, “Johan kha a hring nâwk tah a ni hi,” an ta,"
8,"and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.","ṭhenkhatin, “Elija a hung inlâr tah a ni hi,” an ta, ṭhenkhatin, “Tienlaia zâwlnei tû amanih a tho nâwk tah a ni hi,” an ti leiin."
9,"And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.","Chun, Herod chun, “Johan lu chu ka tan ta kha; nisienlakhawm, hieng ang lâwma a thu ka ihriet hlak hi tû am a na?” a ta. Chun, ama chun hmu a tum tah a."
10,"And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.","Chun, tirkohai chu an hung nâwkin, a kuomah an thilthawhai an hril a. Chun, ama chu anni atuma ṭhuoiin Bethsaida an ti khuoa chun a fe tah a."
11,"But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.","Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chun an hriet a, an zui pei a; chun, ama chun anni chu a lo lâwm a, Pathien ram thu a hril a, sukdam ngaihai chu a sukdam a."
12,"And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.","Chun, khuo a hung inhnu ding a ni tah a, sâwm le pahnihai chu an hung a, a kuomah, “Ei kâwl vêl khuoahai le loahai fea, tlung in le fâk ding an hmu theina dingin mipui hi infetir ta la; hi, thlalêr hmuna um ei ni sih a,” an ta."
13,"But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.","Ama ruok chun an kuomah, “Nangnîn fâk ding pe ro,” a ta. Anni chun, “Hieng mi po po ta ding hin fâk ding kan vân châwkpêk naw chun, beiphêk panga le nga pahni chau naw chu iengkhawm kan nei nawh,” an ta."
14,"For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.","(Patling ruok khawm sâng nga lai rau an ni sih a). Chun, a închûktirhai kuomah, “Apâwl peiin inṭhungtir ro, sâwmnga lai peiin,” a ta."
15,"And they did so, and made them all sit down.","Chuong ang chun an thawh a, an inṭhungtir ta vawng a."
16,"And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.","Chun, beiphêk panga le nga pahni chu a lâk a, vân tieng enin mal a sâwm a, a khawi a, mipui hmaa sem dingin a inchûktirhai kuoma chun a pêk a."
17,"And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.","Chun, an fâk a, an khawp ta vawng a; an fâk mahla nawi chu bâwm sâwm le pahni an rût sip a."
18,"And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?","Chun, Isûn a khât chaua a ṭawngṭai laiin, a închûktirhai chu a kuomah an um a, an kuomah, “Mipuihaiin tu am a nih an mi tih a?” tiin ân dawn a."
19,"And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.","Chun, anni chun, “ ‘Baptistu Johan,’ an ti cheh a, nisienlakhawm, ṭhenkhatin, ‘Elija,’ ṭhenkhatin, ‘Tien- lai zâwlnei tû amanih a tho nâwk tah a nih,’ an ti che,” tiin an dawn a."
20,"And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Anleh, nangnîn tû am a nih in mi tih a?” a ta. Chun Peterin, “Pathien Krista chu,” tiin a dawn a."
21,"But he charged them, and commanded them to tell this to no man;","Chun, chu thu chu tukhawm hril lo ding ti tlatin, thu a pêk a."
22,"saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.","“Mihriem Naupa hin thil tamtak a tuor ding a na, upahai, thiempu lalhai, Dân Inchûktirtuhai dit nawin a um ding a na, thatin a um ding a na, ni thum niah keithoin a um bawk ding a nih,” a ta."
23,"And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.","Chun, ama bawkin mi po po kuomah, “Tûkhawmin mi zui a nuom chun mâni inhnâwlin, ni tin a kraws putin mi zui raw se."
24,"For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.","Tûkhawm a nun humhim nuom phawt chun chân a ta; tûkhawm keia leia nun chân taphawt chun, ama ngei chun humhim a tih."
25,"For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?","Mîn khawvêl hi a pumin nei sienla, insukboin amanih insukse sienla, a ta dingin iengam ṭhahnem a ta?"
26,"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.","Tûkhawm kei le ka thu inzapui taphawt chu, Mihriem Naupa hin ama ropuina leh, a Pa ropuina leh, a vântirko inthienghai ropuina leh a hung pha chun ama chu hung inzapui vêng a tih."
27,"But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.","Indiktakin ka hril cheu hi, hitaka ngîrhai a ṭhen hi Pathien ram an hmu hmakhat chun thina intem tawp lo ding an um,” a ta."
28,"And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.","Chun, chuong thu a hrila inthawk ni riet amanih lai hnunga chun, Isûn Peter hai, Johan hai, Jakob hai chu a ṭhuoi a, ṭawngṭai dingin tlângah a hang feh a."
29,"And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and dazzling.","Chun, a ṭawngṭai laiin a hmêl umzie chu a hung danglam a, a silfênhai chu a hung vâr a, mi elkhal theiin a um tah a."
30,"And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;","Chun, ngai ta, mi pahni ama leh an inbiek a, chuhai chu Mosie le Elija an nih;"
31,"who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.","ropuinaa inthuomin an inlâr a, Jerusalem khuoa a thi tleitlâkna ding thu an hril a."
32,"Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.","Peter le a ruolhai ruok chu an inlusuh a; chun, an har phingleh a ropuizie le a kâwla mi pahni ngîr chu an hmu tah a."
33,"And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.","Chun, anni chun Isu an mâksan ding laiin, Peterin Isu kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, ei ta dingin hitaka um zing hi a ṭha; bâwkte pathum khâwng kan tih, i ta dingin pakhat, Elija ta dingin pakhat, Mosie ta dingin pakhat,” a ta, a thu hril khawm hre loin."
34,"And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril laiin sûm a hung zîng a, anni a hlie tah a; sûma chun an lût laiin an ṭih a."
35,"And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.","Chun, sûma chun râwl a hung suok a, “Hi hi ka Naupa, ka ithlang chu a nih, ama thu ngai ro,” a ta."
36,"And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.","Chun, râwl chu a bo phingleh Isu chu ama chauin an hmu tah a. Chun, an to zing a, chuong lai vêl chun an thil hmu chu tukhawm an hril nawh."
37,"And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.","Chun, a zîngah tlânga inthawka an ṭum hnung chun, mipui nasatakin ama chu an lo tuok a."
38,"And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:","Chun, ngai ta, mipui lai chun, mi pakhat a khêk a, “Inchûktirtu, ka naupa hi en dingin ka ngên che, ka nau nei sun a ni sih a."
39,"and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.","Ngai ta, khawhriin a man hlak a, a khêk suok thut hlak, chuong- chun, a chilhuom tla khawpin a sawisa hlak a, nasataka sukhliemin a mâksan ṭâwk hlak."
40,And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.,"Chun, i închûktirhai kuomah hnawt dawk dingin ka ngên a, an thei si nawh a,” a ta."
41,"And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.","Chun, Isûn “Ruolthar ringna nei loa kâwmawhai, ieng chen am in kuomah um ka ta, ngaithei ka ti cheu a? I naupa chu hitaka hin hung ṭhuoi rawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
42,"And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare him grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.","Chun, a hung laiin, khawhri chun a sukthlûk rak a, nasatakin a sawisa tah a. Nisienlakhawm, Isûn khawhri inthieng naw chu a hal a, naupang chu a sukdam a, a pa kuoma chun ân fetir nâwk tah a."
43,"And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,","Chun, mi po poin Pathien ropuizie chu mak an ti hleh a. Chuongchun, mi po po chun a thilthaw po po chu mak an ti lai chun, Isûn a închûktirhai kuoma chun,"
44,Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.,"“Chuong thu chu in naah lût raw se, Mihriem Naupa hi mihriem- hai kuta inmantirin a um ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
45,"But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.","Nisienlakhawm, a thu hril chu a ngaina an hriet nawh a, an hriet thei nawna dingin ân thup a nih, chu thu hril chanchin chu ama hlak an indawn ngam si nawh a."
46,"And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.","Chun, “Eini lai tu am ropui tak a ta?” tiin an lo insêl a."
47,"But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,","Chuongchun, Isûn an lungrila an ngaituo chu a hriet a, naupangte a kei a, a sîrah ân ngirtir a,"
48,"and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.","an kuomah, “Tûkhawm, ka hming leia hi naupangte lâwm taphawt chu kei a mi lâwm ning a ta, tukhawm kei mi lâwm chu a mi tirtu lâwm nîng a tih, nangni laia chîntak hi a nih a ropui chu,” a ta."
49,"And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.","Chun, Johan chun, “Inchûktir- tu, tu amanih i hminga khawhrihai hnawt dawk kan hmuh a, kan zuina cheah a ṭhang ve naw leiin kan khap el annaw,” a ta, a dawn a."
50,"But Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against you is for you.","Isu ruok chun a kuomah, “Khap ta naw ro, tûkhawm nangni sêlkal naw chu in tienga ṭhang a ni sih a,” a ta."
51,"And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,","Chun, ama vâna ṭhuoi a hun ding laiin, Jerusalema fe tumin a ngha tlat a,"
52,"and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.","a hmaah thangkohai ân tlântir a, chun, an feh a, ama lo buotsaipêk dingin Samari khuo pakhatah an lût a."
53,"And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem.","Chun, a mitmei chu Jerusalem tieng pana ân lang leiin ama an lâwm nawh."
54,"And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?","Chuongchun, a închûktir Jakob le Johan chun chu chu an hriet phingleh, “Lalpa, hienghai kâng vawngna ding hi vâna inthawkin mei ko thla inlang rem i ti?” an ta."
55,"But he turned, and rebuked them.","Ama ruok chu a hang nghah a, a baukhat a."
56,And they went to another village.,"Chun, khaw dangah an fe tah a."
57,"And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.","Chun, lampuia an fe laiin tuin amanih a kuomah, “I fena taphawtah zui ka ti che,” a ta."
58,"And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.","Isûn a kuomah, “Sihalhaiin kuo an nei a, chunga vatehai khawmin bu an nei a, Mihriem Naupa ruok hin chu a lu innghatna a nei nawh,” a ta."
59,"And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.","Chun, Isûn mi dang kuomah, “Mi zui rawh,” a ta. Ama chun, “Lalpa, ka pa mîn vuitir zet rawh,” a ta."
60,"But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.","Isu ruok chun a kuomah, “Mithiin anni mithi chu vui raw se; nang chun Pathien ram thu va hril dar lem rawh,” a ta."
61,"And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.","Chun, mi dang khawmin, “Lalpa, zui ka ti che, amiruokchu, ka ina mihai bau ṭhain mîn thlatir zet rawh,” a ta."
62,"But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.","Isûn a kuomah, “Tukhawm hnuoi inletnaa kut innghata, hnung tieng ngha chu Pathien rama mi ni tlâk a ni nawh,” a ta."
