1,"Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.","Chun, Châwlni vawikhat chu bu bilahai a fe thleng a, a închûktirhai chun bu vuihai chu an thliek a, an kutphaah an nuoi fai a, an fâk a."
2,"But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?","Chun, Pharisai tuhaiin amani chun, “Ieng dinga Châwlnia thaw thieng naw chu in thaw am a na?” an tih a."
3,"And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and they that were with him;","Chun, Isûn a dawn a, “A ruolhai le an phîngṭam laia David thilthaw kha in tiem naw am a nih?"
4,"how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone?","Khânga Pathien inah a lût a, thiempuhai chau naw chun fâk thieng lo entirna bei chu a lâk a, a fâk a, a ruolhai khawm a pêk ve thu kha,” a ta."
5,"And he said unto them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuoma chun, “Mihriem Naupa hi Châwlni Lal a nih,” a ta."
6,"And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.","Chun, Châwlni danga chun inkhâwmna inah a lût a, ân chûktir a; chutaka chun mi pakhat kut chang- tieng zeng a lo um a."
7,"And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him.","Chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihai chun, a hêkna ding an hmu theina dingin, châwlni chun a sukdam ding le ding naw an enthlit a."
8,"But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an lungril chu a hriet a, kut zeng kuoma chun, “Tho la, a laiah ngîr dawk rawh,” a ta. Chun, a tho a, a ngîr dawk tah a."
9,"And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Châwlni hin sukṭhat am a thienga, suksiet? Sandam am a thienga, sukhlum? kân dawn cheu a nih,” a ta."
10,"And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored.","Chun, an rêng chun a en vêl a, a kuomah, “I kut phar rawh,” a ta. Chun, a phar a, a kut chu a dam tah a."
11,But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.,"Chuongchun, an lungsen chun an puokkawi vâng vâng a, Isu chunga an thaw dân ding an inrâwn a."
12,"And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.","Chun, chuong lai chun a suok a, ṭawngṭai dingin tlângah a feh a, Pathien kuomah a ṭawngṭai zân- khuoh a."
13,"And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles:","Chun, khawvar phingleh a închûktirhai chu a ko a; anni laia mi sâwm le pahni a thlang a, an hminga khawm tirko ân bûk a;"
14,"Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,","chuonghai chu Simon (Peter ân bûk bawk chu) le a unau Andri hai, Jakob le Johan hai, Philip le Bartholomai hai,"
15,"and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphæus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,","Matthai le Thoma hai, Alphai naupa Jakob hai, Simon Zelot an ti hai,"
16,"and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor;","Jakob naupa Juda hai, ân mantirtu ding Juda Iskariot hai an nih."
17,"and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judæa and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;","Chun, anni ruolin a fe thlah a, hmun inzâwlah a ngîr a, a închûk- tirhai mipui nasatak leh, Judai ram po poa inthawk le Jerusalema inthawk le Tura le Sidon khuo tienga tuisuoriet panga inthawk mi tamtak leh;"
18,and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.,"chuonghai chu a thu ngai nuom le an natnahai insukdam nuomin an hung a nih; chuongchun, khawhri inthieng naw isawisakhai khawm an hung dam tah a."
19,"And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed them all.","Chun, a kuoma inthawka thil- thawtheina suoka mi tin a sukdam pei leiin, mipui po po chun ama them an tum a."
20,"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.","Chun, a dâk suok a, a închûk- tirhai chu a en a, “Nangni rimsihai, in hamṭha ie, Pathien ram in ta a ni sih a."
21,Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.,"“Nangni tuta phîngṭamhai, in hamṭha ie; in la khawp ding a ni sih a. “Nangni tuta ṭaphai, in hamṭha ie; in lân nui ding a ni sih a."
22,"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.","“Mihriem Naupa leia mihaiin an theida cheu a, an tuithlâra an hal cheu a, in hming a ṭha nawh tia an pei hmang dêr phaleh in la hamṭha ding a nih."
23,"Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets.","Chu ni chun lâwm unla, hlimin inchâwm ro; ngai ta u, vânah in lâwmman a um râwn sih a; chuong ang bawkin an thlatuhaiin zâwlnei- hai chungah an thaw hlak kha."
24,But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.,"“Amiruokchu, nangni mi hausa- hai, in chung a rik ie; in thlamuongna in hmu ta sih a."
25,"Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you, ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.","“Nangni tuta khawphai, in chung a rik ie; in phîng a la ṭâm ding a ni sih a. “Nang ni tuta innuihai, in chung a rik ie; lungngaiin in la ṭap ding a ni sih a."
26,"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets.",“Mi po poin an inpâk pha cheu in chung la rik a tih; chuong ang bawkin an thlatuhaiin zâwlnei tehlêmhai chungah an thaw hlak kha.
27,"But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,","“Ka thu ngaituhai, ka hril cheu hi, in hmêlmahai chu hmangai unla, a theidahai cheu chu an ṭhatna ding thaw unla,"
28,"bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.","ṭawngsie inphurtuhai cheu chu malsâwmpêk unla, a sawisatuhai cheu chu ṭawngṭaipêk ro."
29,To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also.,"“Bieng khing tienga bentu cheu chu khing tieng khawm dâwpêk ro; chun, i puon lâkpêktu che kuoma chun i zakuo lâk khawm sêl naw."
30,Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.,"“A hnitu taphawt che kuomah pe rawh; chun, i thil lâkpêktu che kuoma chun hni nâwk ta naw rawh."
31,"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.","“Chun, mîn in chunga an thaw dinga in dit ang peiin mi chunga khawm thaw ve ro."
32,"And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them.","“Chun, nangni hmangaituhai chau in hmangai hin, lâwm ieng am hlâwng in ta? Mi suolhai khawmin anni hmangaituhai chu an hmangai hlak annâwm."
33,"And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same.","Chun, in chunga ṭhahai chunga chau in ṭha hin lâwm ieng am hlâwng in ta? Mi suolhai khawmin chuong ang bawkin an thaw annâwm."
34,"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.","Chun, hmu nâwk beiseina kuom chaua thil in inpûktir hin lâwm ieng am hlâwng in ta? mi suolhai khawmin a ngai bawka hmu nâwk dingin misuolhai kuomah an inpûktir hlak."
35,"But love your enemies, and do them good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.","Amiruokchu, in hmêlmahai hmangai unla, an ṭhatna ding thaw unla, inpûktir ro, beidawng dêr loin; chuongchun, in lâwmman tam a ta, Achunghnungtak nauhai ni bawk in tih; ama chun mi lâwmnachâng hre lohai le mi suolhai a lunginsiet hlak."
36,"Be ye merciful, even as your Father is merciful.",In Pain mî a lunginsiet angin mî lunginsiet ve ro.
37,"And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released:","“Sawisêl naw ro, chuongchun, sawisêlin um naw ti niu. Tukhawm thiemnawah ruot naw ro, chuongchun, inthiemloin um naw ti niu. Ngaidam ro, chuongchun, ngai- damin um in tih."
38,"give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.","Pe ro, chuongchun pêkin um in tih, ṭhahnemngaitaka inkhia, nam- dêna, sâwi muka, liem zar zara, in mal chungah pêk nîng in tih. In inkhîna ngai bawkin inkhipêk in ni ding a ni sih a,” a ta."
39,"And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?","Chun, an kuomah tekhithu a hril a, “Mitdelin mitdel ma a ṭhuoi thei ding am a nih? an pahni chun khurah an tla rêl el naw ding am a nih?"
40,The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher.,"Inchûktu chu a inchûktirtu chungah a um nawh; nisienlakhawm, mi tin an inchûk zo pha an inchûktirtu angin um an tih."
41,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?","“Chun, ieng dinga mâni mita tlungpûm um chu ngaituo si loa, i unau mita hmawl hlek um chu i hmu am a na?"
42,"Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.","Mâni mita tlungpûm um chu hmu si loin, i unau kuomah, ‘Unau, i mita hmawl hlek um kha mîn lâk dawk tir rawh,’ iengtin am i ti thei a? Mi vervêk! i mita inthawkin tlung- pûm kha la dawk hmasa rawh, chuongchun, i unau mita inthawka hmawl hlek lâk dawk ding chu fietakin hmu thei i tih."
43,For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit.,“Thing ṭha hrim hrim ra sea ra a um nawh; thing ṭha naw hlak ra ṭhaa ra a um bawk nawh.
44,"For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.","Thing tin anni ra sengah ân hriet a nih. Mîn hruihlingnei kûngah theichang an lo ngai nawh, nghardai kûngah grêp an lo ngai bawk nawh."
45,The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.,Mi ṭha chun a lungril ro bâwm ṭhaa inthawkin thil ṭhahai a the suok hlak; mi suol chun a lungril ro bâwm siea inthawkin thil ṭha nawhai a the suok hlak; a lungril sip liem chu a bauin a hril suok el hlak a ni sih a.
46,"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?","“Chun, nangnîn ieng dinga ka thu zâwm si loa, ‘Lalpa, Lalpa,’ in mi ti hlak am?"
47,"Every one that cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:","Mi tin ka kuoma hunga, ka thu hrea zâwm taphawt chu tû ang am an nih inhriettir ka ti cheu:"
48,"he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well builded.","In bâwltu, inthûktaka choa, lungpui chunga lungphûm remtu ang chu an nih. Chun, tui a hung lienin tui hrâtin chu in chu a khawh a, a sukhnîng thei nawh a, a bâwl ngun leiin."
49,"But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.","Amiruokchu, hrea zâwm naw chu, lung phûm loa, hnuoi chung ela in bâwltu ang chu an nih; tuihrâtin chu chu a khawh a, a chim nghâl tah a: a chim chu nasatak a nih,” a ta."
