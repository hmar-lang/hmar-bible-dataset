1,"Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.","Chu zoa chun Lalpân mi dang sâwmsari a ruot a, a fena ding khaw tina le hmun tinah, a hmaah pahni peiin a tir a."
2,"And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.","Chun, an kuomah, “Bu sîk ding a tam hleh a, nisienlakhawm, a sin- thawtuhai an tlâwm; chuongchun, a bu sîk dinga sinthawtuhai ding tir dingin bu Neitupa kuoma chun ngên ro."
3,"Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.","“Fe ro, ngai ta u, satene laia berâmte um angin ka tir cheu hi."
4,"Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.","Tangka ip dâm, mansa dâm, kekawk dâm, chawi naw ro, lampuiah tukhawm chibai bûk naw ro."
5,"And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house.","Chun, in in lûtna taphawtah a hmasatakin, ‘Hi ina hin thlamuongna tlung raw se,’ ti ro."
6,"And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.","Chun, chutaka chun thlamuong nau a um chun in thlamuongna thu chu a chungah um zing a tih; a um naw ruok chun in chungah hung kîr nâwk a tih."
7,"And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.","Chu ina chun um zing unla, an pêk taphawt cheu chu fain dâwn unla, sinthawtu chu hlaw hmu tlâk a nih. In tinah fe lâwr naw ro."
8,"And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:","“Chun, khuo in lûtna taphawtah an lâwm cheu chun an pêk ang ang cheu chu fa ro;"
9,"and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.","an khuoa damnaw umhai khawm sukdam unla, an kuomah, ‘Pathien ram in kuomah a tlung tah,’ ti ro."
10,"But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say,","Khuo in lûtna taphawtah an lâwm naw cheu ruok chun, an kawtthlêrahai fe suok unla,"
11,"Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh.","‘In khaw pilvut kan kephaa kai khawm hi in chungah kan hrûk fai hi; nisienlakhawm, Pathien ram in kuomah a hung tlung tah ti hi hre ro,’ ti ro."
12,"I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.","Ka ti cheu hi, chu nia chun chu khuohai tuor nêk chun Sodom khaw tuor ding chu a zie um lem a tih."
13,"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","“Korazin i chung a rik! Bethsaida, i chung a rik! Nangnia thil maktak thawa umhai kha Tura le Sidona thaw ni sienla, saiip puon sila vut laia ṭhungin sim dai tâng an tih."
14,"But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.","Nisienlakhawm, ngaituo nia chun nangni tuor nêk chun Tura le Sidon tuor ding chu a zie um lem a tih."
15,"And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades.","Chun, nang Kapernaum, vân chenin chawimawi i ni ding am a nih? Mithi khuo chena nam thlâk i ni ding i sawnnaw."
16,He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.,"“Tûkhawm nangni thu ngai chu keima thu ngai a nih; tûkhawm a dit naw cheu chu kei a mi dit naw a nih; tûkhawm kei mi dit naw chu a mi tirtu dit naw a nih,” a ta."
17,"And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.","Chun, sâwmsarihai chu lâwm- takin an hung a, “Lalpa, khawhrihai khawm i hming leiin kan thu thuin an um,” an ta."
18,"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Kâwlinlep angin Setan vâna in- thawka hung tla kha ka hmu annaw."
19,"Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.","Ngai ta u, rûlhai le ainuvêthai sirdena thu le, hmêlma thuneina po po letthlâkna thu ka pêk cheu hi; iengkhawmin sukna naw tawp a cheu."
20,"Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.","Nisienlakhawm, khawhrihai in thu thua an um leiin lâwm naw ro; vâna in hming ziek a ni leiin lâwm lem ro,” a ta."
21,"In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.","Chun, chu lai tak chun Isu chu Thlarau Inthiengah a lâwm bêk bêk a, “Aw Pa, hnuoi le vân Lalpa, nangin mi var le mi bengvârhai kuomah hieng thu hi i ip a, nautêhai kuomah i phuong lei hin kân pâk che; anih, Pa, chuong anga thaw chu i ngaiin a ṭha a nih."
22,"All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him.","Ka Pain iengkim a mîn kawltir tah, Naupa chu tû am a na, Pa naw chun tukhawmin an hriet nawh; Pa khawm chu tû am a ni Naupa le an kuomah Naupain a phuong nuomnahai chau naw chun tukhawmin an hriet nawh,” a ta."
23,"And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:","Chun, inchûktirhai kuom tieng chu a nghah a, inrûkin, “In thil hmuhai hi a hmûna mithai chu a vângnei ie!"
24,"for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.","Ka ti cheu hi, zâwlnei tamtak le, lal tamtakhai khawmin in thil hmuhai hi hmu an inhâwk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, an hmu si nawh; naa in hriethai khawm hi hriet an nuom hlak, nisienlakhawm, an hriet si naw a nih,” a ta."
25,"And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?","Chun, ngai ta, dân hretu tû amanih a ngîr a, ama infiena dingin, “Inchûktirtu, chatuona hringna neina dingin ieng am ka thaw ding?” a ta."
26,"And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Dân lekhabuah ieng am ziek a na? chutaka chun ieng am i tiem hlak a?” a ta."
27,"And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.","Chun, ama chun, “ ‘Lalpa i Pa- thien chu i lungril po poin, i thlarau po poin, i hrâtna po poin, i lungvar po poin i hmangai ding a nih’; ‘Nangma în hmangai angin i vênghai khawm i hmangai ding a nih,’ ti hi,” a ta, a dawn a."
28,"And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.","Ama chun a kuomah, “I dawn dik ngawt el ie; chuong ang chun thaw la hring i tih,” a ta."
29,"But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?","Ama ruok chun thiem inchang- tir a tum a, Isu kuomah, “Anleh, ka vênghai chu tuhai am an na?” a ta."
30,"Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.","Isûn a dawn a, “Tû amanih Jerusalema inthawkin Jerikoah a zu fe ding a na, suomhmanghai ân tuokpui hlau a, chuhai chun a silfên an hlîppêk vawng a, an vuok hrep a, thi vâng vângin an fe san tah a."
31,"And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.","Chun, thiempu tû amanih chu lampuia chun a zu fe kher a, a hmu phingleh lampui sîr khat tieng a hêl el tah a."
32,"And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.","Chun, chuong ang bawkin Levi chi mi pakhat khawm chu hmun chu a hung tlung a, a hmu phingleh lam- pui sîr khing tieng a hêl ve el tah a."
33,"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,","Amiruokchu, Samari rama mi tû amanih ân zin fe hin a umna chu a hung tlung a, a hmu phingleh a lunginsiet bêk bêk a."
34,"and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.","A kuomah a va feh a, a pawpahai chun hriek le uoin dâm a nâl a, a tuom a, ama sa chungah ân chuongtir a, khuolbûkah a fepui a, a enkawl tah a."
35,"And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.","Chun, a zînga chun duli pahni a kei dawk a, khuolbûk vêngtu kuomah a pêk a, ‘Lo enkawl la, hi bâka i sêng po chu ka hung kîr nâwk pha hung thung ka ti che,” a ta."
36,"Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?",“Chuhai pathum laia chun suomhmang tuokpa vênghai chu a tû tak chu am ni dingin i ring a?” a ta.
37,"And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.","Ama chun, “Ama lunginsiettu chu,” a ta. Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Nang khawm chuong ang bawk chun va thaw ve rawh,” a ta."
38,"Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.","Chun, an inzin malamin khaw ienga manih a lût a; chun, nuhmei pakhat a hming Marthain a lo intlungtir a."
39,"And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet, and heard his word.","Ama chun zuorpui pakhat a nei a, Mari a na; ama chu Lalpa ke bulah a ṭhung a, a thu a ngai a."
40,"But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.","Martha ruok chu rawngbâwl ngawtin a buoi hleh a; chuongchun, a kuomah a hung a, “Lalpa, ka zuorpuinu hin keia khât chau rawng bâwl dinga a mi dânde hi pawi i ti naw am a nih? mi ṭhangpui dingin hril raw khai,” a ta."
41,"But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:","Chun, Lalpain, “Martha, Martha, thil tamtak i ngaituoa i buoi a ni hi,"
42,"but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.","thil pakhat chau a pawimaw; Mariin chan ṭha a thlang a, chu chu lâkpêk ding a ni nawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
