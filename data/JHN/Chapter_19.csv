1,"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.","Chun, chuong lai chun Pilatin Isu a ṭhuoi a, a vuok a."
2,"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;","Chun, sipaihai chun hling lukhum an phier a, an inkhumtir a, puon sen duk an insiltir bawk a,"
3,"and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.","chun, a kuomah an hung a, “Chibai, Judahai Lal,” an ta, an ben a."
4,"And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.","Pilat chu a suok nâwk a, an kuomah, “En ta u, iengkhawm a suol ka hmu nawh ti in hrietna dingin in kuomah ka hung ṭhuoi suok hi,” a ta."
5,"Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold, the man!","Chun, Isu chu hling lukhum le puon sen duk chu sil pumin a hung suok a. Chun, Pilatin an kuomah, “En ta u, mihriempa hi,” a ta."
6,"When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le manmi- hai chun ama an hmu phingleh an khêk a, “Krawsah hemde rawh, krawsah hemde rawh,” an ta. Pilatin an kuomah, “Nangnîn fepui unla, krawsah hemde ro; kei chu ieng khawm a suolna ka hmu si nawh,” a ta."
7,"The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.","Judahai chun a kuomah, “Kan dân kawng khat a um, chu dân ang peiin Pathien Naua ân siem leiin, a thi ding a nih,” an ta, an dawn a."
8,"When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;",Pilatin chu thu chu a hrietin a ṭi nâwk zuol a;
9,"and he entered into the Prætorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.","a inah a lût nâwk a, Isu kuomah, “Khâwtienga mi am I nih a?” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, Isûn a dawn nawh."
10,"Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?","Chun, Pilatin a kuomah, “Nangin kei i mi biek naw vei maw? Inthla thei che ka nih, krawsa hemde thei che ka nih ti i hriet naw am a nih?” a ta."
11,"Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.","Isûn, “Chungtienga inthawka pêk i ni naw chun, ka chunga hin thaw thei hrim hrim nei naw ti ni; chuleiin, i kuoma mi petu khan suol a phur zuol a nih,” a ta."
12,"Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Cæsar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar.","Chun, chu chena inthawk chu Pilatin inthla a tum a, nisien- lakhawm, Judahai an khêk a, “Hi mipa hi în thla chun Kaisar ruolpa ni naw ti ni, tûkhawm lala insiem taphawt chu Kaisar do an nih,” an ta."
13,"When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.","Chun, Pilatin chuong thu chu a hriet phingleh Isu a ṭhuoi suok a, a hming Lungrem, Hebrai ṭawng chun Gabbatha an ta, chu hmuna chun rorêlna ṭhungphaah a ṭhung a."
14,"Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!","(Chun, chu ni chu Fekân Ruoiṭhe Inringlâwk ni a nih, nisa inding vêl a nih.) Chun, ama chun Judahai kuomah, “En ta u, in Lal hi,” a ta."
15,"They therefore cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cæsar.","Chun, anni chu an khêk a, “Sukbohmang rawh, sukbohmang rawh, krawsah hemde rawh,” an ta. Pilatin an kuomah, “In lal hi krawsah hemdêng ka ti maw?” a ta. Thiempu Lalhaiin, “Kaisar naw chu lal dang kan nei nawh,” an ta, an dawn a."
16,Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.,"Chuongchun, Pilatin krawsa hemde dingin ama chu an kuomah a pêk tah a."
17,"They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha:","Chuongchun, Isu chu an ṭhuoi tah a. Ama chun mâni ta dinga kraws putin, “Lu ru hmun,” an ti, Hebrai ṭawng chun Golgotha an ti, chu hmun chen chun a va suok a."
18,"where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.","Chutaka chun ama chu krawsah an hemdeh a, mi dang pahni khawm krawsah an hemde bawk a, a sîr tuokah pakhat ve vein, a laiah Isu."
19,"And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.","Chun, Pilatin lekha a ziek a, kraws lêr tieng a bel a, “NAZARETH ISU JUDAHAI LAL,” tiin ziek a nih."
20,"This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, and in Latin, and in Greek.","Chu lekha chu Judahai a ṭhen tamtakin an tiem a; Isu krawsa an hemdena hmun chu khawpui kâwl a na, Hebrai ṭawng dâm, Rom ṭawng dâm, Grik ṭawng dâmin ziek a nih."
21,"The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews.","Chuongchun, Judahai thiempu lalhai chun, Pilat kuomah “ ‘Judahai Lal,’ tiin ziek naw la, ‘Judahai Lal ka nih a tih,’ tiin ziek lem rawh,” an ta."
22,"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.","Pilat chun, “Ka ziek kha ka ziek zo tah,” a ta, a dawn a."
23,"The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.","Chun, sipaihaiin Isu chu krawsa an hemde zo chun, a silfênhai an lâk a, phêk liin an siem a, sipaihaiin phêk khatin an chang seng a; a zakuo an lâk bawk a. Zakuo chu ṭhuilo zakuo a na, a rînga inthawka a puma khâwng vawng a nih."
24,"They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.","Chuleiin, anni chun, “Kei thlêr nâwng ei tiu, tu ta tak ding am a na, ai sân lem ei tiu,” an in tih a, Pathien Lekha Thu, “Ka silfênhai an insem a, Ka zakuo dingin ai an sân a,” ti a tlungna dingin. Chuong thil chu sipaihaiin an thaw a nih."
25,"These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.","Chun, Isu kraws kâwlah a nu le a nu zuorpuinu Mari, Kleopa nuhmei, le Mari Magdalin an ngîr a."
26,"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son!","Chun, Isûn a nu le a inchûktir a ihmangai kha a kâwla ngir a hmuh a, a nu kuomah, “Nuhmei, en ta, i naupa kha!” a ta."
27,"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.","Chun, inchûktir kuoma khawm chun, “En ta, i nu kha!” a ta. Chun, chu chena inthawk chu, chu inchûktir chun amanu chu a inah a ṭhuoi tah a."
28,"After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.","Chu hnunga chun Isûn thil iengkim tuhin a kim tah ti a hriet a, Pathien Lekha Thu kha a tlungna dingin, “Ka dang a châr ie,” a ta."
29,"There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.","Chutaka chun bêl pakhat uoin thûra sip an intung a, chuongchun sponj pakhat chu uoin thûra inchie sipin husop hmawlah an târ a, a hmûr an hang intlun a."
30,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.","Chun, Isûn uoin thûr chu a lo dâwn zo chun, “A kin tah,” a ta. A lu a kûn a, a thlarau ân thla tah a."
31,"The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.","Chun, Inringlâwk ni a ni leiin, ruonghai chu Châwlnia krawsa a um zing nawna dingin, (chu Châwlni chu ni ropui a ni sih a,) Judahaiin Pilat kuomah an kehai suktlieka, an ruong fepui dingin an ngên a."
32,"The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:","Chun, sipaihai chu an hung a, a kuoma krawsa an hemde a tawntira mi le mi dang chu an kehai an suktliek a."
33,"but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:","Nisienlakhawm, Isu kuomah an hung a, a thi ta zing ti an hriet a, a kehai an suktliek ve nawh a."
34,"howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.","Nisienlakhawm, sipaihai laia mi pakhatin a nâkah feiin a sun a, chuongchun, thisen le tui a suok nghâl ta a."
35,"And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.","A hmutu chun ân hriettir tah (a thu inhriettir chu ân dik a nih, a hril indik ti khawm a hriet,) nangni khawmin in ringna dingin."
36,"For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.","Pathien Lekha Thu, “A ru pakhat khawm suktliek ni naw ni,” ti a tlungna dingin chuong thil chu a hung um tah a nih."
37,"And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.","Chun, Pathien Lekha Thu dangin “An isun ngei chu la en an tih,” a ti bawk a."
38,"And after these things Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.","Chun, chuong thil thaw zo chun, Josef Arimathai khuoa mi, Isu inchûktir a nih, nisienlakhawm, Judahai a ṭi leiin a rûka um a na, ama chun Isu ruong chu fepui dingin Pilat kuomah a hnih a, chun Pilatin a phal a. Chuongchun, a hung a, a ruong chu a fepui tah a."
39,"And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.","Chun, Nikodem, (a tîra zâna a kuoma hung khan,) murra le aloe inpawlsa bûk sâwmnga lai chawiin a hung veh a."
40,"So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.","Chun, Isu ruong chu an lâk a, Judahai inphûm dân angin thil rim inhnikhai le chun puon zai inhmiin an tuom a."
41,Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.,"Chun, krawsa an hemdena hmuna chun huon pakhat a um a, huona chun tukhawm lân zâlna ngainaw thlân thar pakhat a um."
42,There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.,"Chun, Judahai Inringlâwk ni a ni leiin, thlân chu an kâwl el a ni sih a, chutaka chun Isu chu an inzâl tah a."
