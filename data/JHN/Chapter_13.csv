1,"Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end.","Chun, Fekân Ruoiṭhe hmain Isûn hi khawvêl hi suok sana, Pa kuoma a fe hun a tlung tah ti a hriet a. Amaa mi khawvêla um a hmangai hlakhai chu, a tâwp chen khawmin a hmangai zing a."
2,"And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him,","Chun, zânbu fâk laiin, (chu hma khawm chun diebolin Simon naupa Iskariot Juda chu Isu inmantir dingin ân lungriltir a,)"
3,"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God,","Isûn Pain a kuta thil iengkim ân kawltir dâm, Pathien kuoma in- thawka hung suok a ni dâm, Pathien kuoma a fe ding dâm hre zingin,"
4,"riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself.","a zânbu awt chu a tho a, a puonhai a sieh a, inhrûkna puon a lâk a, a dierkei a."
5,"Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.","Chun, châwtawlah tui a sung a, inchûktirhai ke a sâwp a, inhrûkna puon a dierkei chun a hrûk pei a."
6,"So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?","Chuongchun, Simon Peter kuomah a hung a. Ama chun, “Lalpa, nang êmin ka ke i sâwp ding am a nih?” a ta."
7,"Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.","Isûn a kuomah, “Ka thilthaw hi tuhin i hriet nawh; nisienlakhawm, nakie tieng la hrieng i tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
8,"Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.","Peterin a kuomah, “Ka ke sâwp naw tawp i tih!” a ta; Isûn a kuomah, “Ka sâwp naw che chun ka kuomah iengkhawm chan nei naw ti nih,” a ta."
9,"Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.","Simon Peter chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, chuong a ni chun, ka ke chau ni loin, ka kut le ka lu khawm tie,” a ta."
10,"Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.","Isûn a kuomah, “Insil ta chu a ke naw chu sâwp a ngai nawh, a fai deh annâwm; nangni in fai, in rêng ruok chun ni loin,” a ta."
11,"For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.","(Ân mantirtu ding chu a hriet sih a; chuleiin, “In rêngin in fai nawh,” a ti a nih.)"
12,"So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?","Chuongchun, an ke a sâwp a, a puonhai a lâk a, a ṭhung nâwk chun an kuomah, “In chunga ka thilthaw hi ieng thawna am a na, in hriet am?"
13,"Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.","Nangnîn Inchûktirtu le Lalpa in mi ti hlak; in ti indik hle, ka ni ngei hrim a."
14,"If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.","Kei Lalpa le Inchûktirtu hmanin in ke ka sâwp chun, nangni khawmin in ke in insâwppêk ding a nih."
15,"For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.",In chunga ka thaw ang hin nangni khawmin in thaw vena dingin ka sukhmu cheu a ni sih a.
16,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, suok a pu nêkin a ropui nawh; tirko khawm a tirtu nêkin a ropui bawk nawh."
17,"If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.","Chuong thil chu in hriet chun, thaw unla, hamṭhâng in tih."
18,"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me.","In rênga thu ka hril nawh; ka ithlang hai chu ka hriet, nisienlakhawm, chu chu, ‘Ka bei fatu chun, A kekhawng chu ka chungah ân let tah,’ ti Pathien Lekha Thu kha a hung tlung theina dingin a nih."
19,"From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.","Hi hi a hung tlung hmain tuhin ka hril cheu hi, a hung tlung phaleh, kei kha ka nih ti in ring theina dingin."
20,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm ka itir taphawt lâwm chu, keima mi lâwm a nih; tûkhawm kei mi lâwm chu a mi tirtu lâwm a nih,” a ta."
21,"When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.","Isûn chuong anga a hril zo chun, a lungrilin a lunginzîng a, “Titak- zetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, nangni laia mi pakhatin mîn mantir a tih,” a ta, ân hriettir tah a."
22,"The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.","Chun, inchûktirhai chun a ti bîk an hriet nawh a, an inen tâwl a."
23,"There was at the table reclining in Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.","Chun, a închûktirhai laia mi pakhat, Isûn a ihmangai chu, dawkân sîrah Isu ângsûnga bawkin a um a."
24,"Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell us who it is of whom he speaketh.","Chun, Simon Peterin ama kuoma chun, “Tu thu tak am a na a hril, indawn ta,” tiin zaizirin a biek a."
25,"He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?","Ama chu a umna ngaiah a um a, Isu âwm hnengin a hung thleh a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, tu tak am a na?” a ta."
26,"Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.","Chun, Isûn “Bei hlek inchiepêk ka ta, ka ipêk chu nîng a tih,” a ta, a dawn a. Chuongchun, bei hlek chu ân chie hnungin a lâk a, Iskariot Simon naupa Juda kuoma chun a pêk a."
27,"And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly.","Chun, bei hlek chu a pêk hnung- in a sûngah Setan chu a lût nghâl tah a. Chuongchun, Isûn a kuomah, “I thaw ding chu thaw vak rawh,” a ta."
28,Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.,"(Chun, dawkân kiltuhai tu- khawmin iengtiziea ti am a ni an hriet nawh a."
29,"For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.","Ṭhenkhatin “Juda chun tangka ip a kawl leiin, Isûn ‘Ruoiṭhenaa ding thil ei mamawhai inchaw rawh,’ a ti amanih, ‘Pasiehai kuoma iengkhat pêk ding,’ a ti amanih,” an ti a nih.)"
30,He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.,"Chun, ama chun bei hlek chu a lâk a, a suok nghâl tah a; chu lai hun chu zân a nih."
31,"When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him;","Chuongchun, a suok hnung chun Isûn a hril a, “Tuhin chu Mihriem Naupa chawimawiin a um tah, ama leiin Pathien khawm chawimawiin a um a nih."
32,"and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him.","Pathien chu amaah chawi- mawiin a um chun, Pathien khawmin amaa chun ama chu chawimawi a tih, chawimawi nghâl a tih."
33,"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you.","Nauhai, sâwt nawtê in kuomah ka la um hri hi, nangnîn mi zawng in ta; chun, Judahai kuoma, ‘Ka fena dingah hung thei naw ti niu,’ ti ka hril ang khan, tuhin chuong ang bawk chun in kuomah ka hril hi."
34,"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.","“Thupêk thar ka pêk cheu hi, inhmangai tuo unla; keiin ka hma- ngai ang cheu hin, nangni khawm inhmangai tuo ro."
35,"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.","In inhmangai tuo chun mi po poin ka închûktirhai in ni ti chutaka chun hrieng an tih,” a ta."
36,"Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow afterwards.","Simon Peterin a kuomah, “Lalpa, khâwlai am i fe ding a na?” a ta. Isûn, “Ka fena dingah nangnîn tuhin mi zui thei naw ti niu; nakie pha ruok chu mi zui in tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
37,"Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee.","Peterin a kuomah, “Lalpa, iengdingin am tu khawm hin zui thei nâwng ka ti cheh a? Nangma leiin ka hringna pêng ka tih,” a ta."
38,"Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.","Isûn, “Keima leiin i hringna i pêk ding maw? Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril che hi, nangin vawi thum i mîn phat hmakhat chu âr khuong naw ni."
