40,"He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.","“Amain an mit a sukdel a, An lungril a sukvêt a; Chuong naw chun, an mitin hmu rawi an ta, An lungrilin hre rawi an ta, Ngha kîr nâwk rawi an ta; Keiin anni sukdam rawi ka tih,” ti a hril nâwk lei hin."

44,"And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.","Chun, Isu a khêk a, “Tûkhawm keia mi ring chu keia mi ring a ni nawh a, a mi tirtu ring a ni lem."

46,"I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.","êntua khawvêla hung ka ni hi, tûkhawm a mi ring taphawt inthima an um zing nawna dingin."
47,"And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.","Tûkhawm ka thu hril hrein awi naw sienla khawm, keiin thiemnaw kân chang tir nawh; khawvêl thiemnaw inchangtir dinga hung ka ni nawh a; khawvêl sanhim dinga hung ka ni lem."
48,"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.","Tûkhawm mi dit loa, ka thu hrilhai vawn lo chun, thiemnaw inchangtirtu pakhat a nei a nih; ka thu hril kha, kha thu ngei khan ni kin nia chun ama thiemnaw inchangtir a tih."
49,"For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.","Keia phuokfâwmin ka hril si nawh; Pa a mi tirtu chun, ka hril ding le ka ṭawngna ding chu thu a mi pêk a ni lem."
50,"And I know that his commandment is life eternal; the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.","Ama thupêk chu chatuona hringna a nih ti ka hriet, chuleichun, thu ka hrilhai hi Pa mi hril ang peiin ka hril a nih,” a ta."
