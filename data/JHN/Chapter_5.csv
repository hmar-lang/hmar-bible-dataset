1,After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.,Chuong thil hnunga chun Judahai ruoiṭhe pakhat a um a; Isu Jerusalemah a hang feh a.
2,"Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.","Chun, Jerusalema chun berâm kawtkhâr kâwlah dîl a um a, chu chu Hebrai ṭawngin Bethesda an tih a, tuolpûk panga a nei a."
3,"In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered.","Chuonga chun damnawhai, mitdelhai, ke inbaihai, zenghai tamtak an zâl tâwl a, [tui infâwn hun an nghâk a."
4,,"Akâr po leh dîla chun vântirko a zu feh a, tui chu a sukfâwn hlak a; mi tukhawm ieng ang natna nei khawm ni hai sien, tuifâwn zu pal hmasatak taphawt chu an dam pei hlak sih a.]"
5,"And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.","Chutaka chun, kum sâwm thum pariet natna nei mi tu amanih a um a."
6,"When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?","Isûn a zâl chu a hmuh a, chuong ang chun sâwttak a um tah ti a hriet a, a kuomah, “Sukdam i nuom am?” a ta."
7,"The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.","Chun, damnaw chun, “Pu, tui a hung fâwn pha dîla mi sietu ding ka nei nawh a, ka fe sûngin mi dangin an mi fe khêl nâwk hlak,” a ta, a dawn a."
8,"Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Tho la, i puonpha la la, kein lâwn ta rawh,” a ta."
9,"And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.","Chun, kârloin ama chu a dam nghâl tah a, a puonpha a lâk a, a fe tah a. Chu ni chu Châwlni a na."
10,"So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.","Chuongchun, Judahaiin suk- dama um kuoma chun, “Châwlni a ni hi, i puonpha i lâk a thieng nawh ie,” an ta."
11,"But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.","Ama chun an kuomah, “A mi sukdamtu ngeiin ka kuomah, ‘I puonpha la la, kein lâwn ta rawh,’ a mi ti a nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
12,"They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?","Anni chun a kuomah, “ ‘I puon- pha la la, kein lâwn ta rawh,’ titu che chu tu am a na?” an tih a, an indawn a."
13,"But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.","Nisienlakhawm, sukdama um chun tû a ni a hriet nawh a, chutaka chun mipui an um leiin Isu a fe hmang ta sih a."
14,"Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.","A nakie chun ama chu Isûn Pathien biekinah a hmuh a, a kuomah, “Ngai rawh, i dam ta hi, thil suksuol nâwk ta naw rawh, chuong- naw chun, thil ṭha naw nâwk zuol i chungah hung um rawi a tih,” a ta."
15,"The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.","Chun, ama chu a va feh a, Judahai kuoma chun, ama sukdamtu chu Isu a nih ti a hril a."
16,"And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.","Chuongchun, Châwlnia chuong thilhai chu a thaw leiin Judahaiin Isu an suknawmna tah a."
17,"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn anni chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Ka Pain tu chen khawmin sin a thaw hlak, kei khawmin ka thaw hlak,” a ta."
18,"For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.","Chun, Judahaiin sukhlum an tum nâwk zuol a, Châwlni a bawsiet lei chau khawm a ni nawh a, Pathien ama paah ân bûk a, Pathien tluka ân siem lei khawmin a nih."
19,"Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Naupa hin a khâtin iengkhawm a thaw thei nawh, Pa thilthaw a hmu chau naw chu; thil a thaw ang taphawt chu Naupa khawmin a thaw ve hlak."
20,"For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.","Pain Naupa a hmangai a, a thilthaw taphawt a kuomah ân entir hlak; hieng nêka thil ropui lem hi a kuomah lân entir a tih, mak in ti dingin."
21,"For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.","Pain mithihai a keithoa a sukhring hlak angin, Naupa khawm- in a nuom nuom a sukhring hlak."
22,"For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;","Pain tû thu khawm a rêlpêk ngai nawh, thu po po Naupa ân rêltir lem a;"
23,"that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him.","mi po poin Pa an inza angin Naupa khawm an inzana dingin. Tûkhawm Naupa inza naw chu Pa, ama tirtu inza naw a nih."
24,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.","“Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm ka thu hrea a mi tirtu ring chun chatuona hringna a nei tah, inthiemloin a um nawh a, thinaa inthawkin a suok a, hringnaah a lût lem tah a nih."
25,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, a hun a tlung ding a ni tah, tu khawm hin a tlung zing tah, chu pha chun mithihaiin Pathien Naupa râwl hrieng an ta, a hre taphawt hring an tih."
26,"For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:","Pa chun mânia hringna a nei ang bawkin, Naupa mânia hringna neiin a siem;"
27,"and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.","chun, Mihriem Naupa a ni leiin a kuomah rorêl ding thu a pêk."
28,"Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,","Hieng hi mak ti naw ro, a hun a tlung ding a ni tah, chu pha chun thlâna um po poin a râwl hrieng an ta,"
29,"and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.","suok vawng an tih; thil ṭha thawtuhai chu hringna changin tho nâwk an ta, thil suol thawtuhai chu inthiemnawna changin tho nâwk an tih."
30,"I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.","“Keia khâtin iengkhawm ka thaw thei nawh; naa ka hriet ang peiin ro ka rêl hlak; ka rorêl chu indiktak a nih, keia thu thuin um ka tum nawh a, a mi tirtu thu thua um ka tum lem hlak leiin."
31,"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.","Mâni chanchin inhriettir lang, ka thu inhriettir indik naw ni."
32,It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.,Ka chanchin inhriettirtu chu mi dang a nih; ama chun ka chanchin ân hriettir chu ân dik ti ka hriet.
33,"Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth.","“Nangnîn Johan kuomah mi in tir a, ama chun, thutak chanchin a lo inhriettir kha;"
34,"But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.","Thu inhriettir ka ipawm ruok chu mihriem thu a ni nawh, nisien- lakhawm, in damna dingin hieng thu hi ka hril a ni hi."
35,He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.,"Chu Johan chu khâwnvar chawktak le var tak a nih, a varah lân sukhlim in nuom kha."
36,"But the witness which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.","“Nisienlakhawm, inhriettirna ka nei hi Johan inhriettirna nêk khan a ropui lem a nih; Pain thil thaw zo dinga a mi pêk, ka thilthaw ngei hin Pain a mi tir a ni ti ka chanchin ân hriettir a nih."
37,"And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.","Pa a mi tirtu khawm chun ka chanchin ân hriettir tah. Nangnîn iengtik khawm a râwl in hriet ngai nawh, a hmêl khawm in hmu ngai nawh."
38,"And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.",A thu khawm in lungrilah in pai zing ngai nawh; a itir hi in ring naw leiin.
39,"Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me;","Pathien Lekha in tiem ngun hlak a, a sûnga chatuona hringna um dinga in ring leiin; chuong Lekha chu ka chanchin inhriettirna chu a ni sih a."
40,"and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.","Nisienlakhawm, hringna nei dingin ka kuomah in hung nuom si nawh."
41,I receive not glory from men.,“Mihriem ichawimawina ka pawm nawh.
42,"But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves.","Nangni ka hriet cheu, Pathien hmangaina in lungrilah in nei nawh ie."
43,"I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.","Ka Pa hmingin ka hung a, nangnîn in mi lâwm si nawh; mi dang mâni hmingin hung sienla, ama chu lâwm in tih."
44,"How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not?","“Nangni inchawimawituo lâwm- hai, iengtin am ring thei in ta? Pathien tak chaua suok chawi- mawina chu in zawng si nawh."
45,"Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.","Keiin Pa kuoma ka hêk cheu ring naw ro, nangni hêktu cheu chu pakhat a um, in iring Mosie hi."
46,"For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.","Mosie in ring chun, kei khawm mi ring ta ding in nih; ama chun keia chanchin in sawnnaw a ziek."
47,"But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?","Nisienlakhawm, a thu ziek chu in ring si naw chun, iengtin am ka thu ring in ta?” a ta."
