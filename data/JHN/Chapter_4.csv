1,When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John,"Chun, Isûn Johan nêkin inchûktir tam lem a siem le a baptis ti Pharisaihaiin an hriet ti Lalpa chun a hriet phingleh,"
2,"(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),","(nisienlakhawm, Isu meu chun a baptis nawh a, a închûktirhaiin an baptis lem hlak),"
3,"he left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.","Judai ram chu a fe san a, Galili ramah a fe tah a."
4,And he must needs pass through Samaria.,"Chuongchun, Samari ram a fe thleng ding a na."
5,"So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:","Chuongchun, Samari ram khaw pakhat, Sukar an ti chu a hung tlung a, Jakobin a nau Josef kuoma hmun a ipêk kâwl kha."
6,"and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.","Jakob tuisunsuo khawm kha chutaka chun a um. Chuongchun, Isu chu a fe sâwl leiin tuisunsuo sîra chun a ṭhung chawt a; sûn bufâk pha a nih."
7,"There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.","Samari nuhmei pakhat tui chawi dingin a hung a, Isûn a kuomah, “Dâwn ding mi pe rawh,” a ta."
8,For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.,(A închûktirhai hlak chu fâk ding inchaw dingin khuoah an fe ta sih a.)
9,"The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)","Chuongchun, Samari nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Nang Juda mi i na, kei Samari nuhmei ka ni sih a, iengtizie am a na, ka kuoma dâwn ding i hnih?” a ta. (Judahaiin Samari mihai ieng khawm an inṭâwmpui ngai si nawh.)"
10,"Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.","Chun, Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Pathien thilpêk le, ‘Dâwn ding mi pe rawh,’ i kuoma titu hi hre la chu nangin a kuomah i hni lem ding a nih; chun, ama chun tui hring a pêk ding che a nih,” a ta."
11,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?","Chun, nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Pu, khaina iengkhawm i nei si nawh a, tuisunsuo ân thûk vei leh, khâwlaia inthawkin am tui hring chu i hmuh a?"
12,"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?","Kan pu Jakob nêkin i ropui lem am a nih? Ama chun hi tuisunsuo hi a mi pêk a, ama khawmin a dâwn a, a nauhai le a ranhai leh,” a ta."
13,"Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:","Chun, Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Tûkhawm hi tui dâwn taphawt chu an dang châr nâwk a tih;"
14,but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.,"tûkhawm an kuoma ka pêk ding tui dâwn taphawt ruok chu, kum- khuoin dangchâr naw ni hai, keiin an kuoma tui ka pêk ding chu, an sûngah tuihnâr hung um a ta, chatuona hringna chenin inchik dawk a tih,” a ta."
15,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.","Chun, nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Pu, chu tui chu mi pe rawh, ka dangchâr nawna ding le hi chen chena tui chawi dinga ka hung nawna dingin,” a ta."
16,"Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “I pasal va ko la, hitakah hung nâwk rawh,” a ta."
17,"The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:","Chun, nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Pasal ka nei le,” a ta, a dawn a. Isûn a kuomah, “Pasal ka nei le, i ti hi i ti dik ie;"
18,for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.,"pasal panga i nei tah, tuta mi i nei hi i pasal a ni naw hrim a nih, hi thu hi i ti dik ie,” a ta."
19,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.","Nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Pu, zâwlnei i nih ti ka hriet tah."
20,"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.","Keini thlatuhai chun hi tlânga hin Pathien chibai an bûk hlak; nisienlakhawm, nangni chun, ‘Mihriemin Pathien chibai an bûkna hmun ding chu Jerusalemah a um,’ in ti hlak,” a ta."
21,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Nu- hmei, ka thu awi rawh, hi tlânga kher naw khawm, Jerusalema kher naw khawm, Pathien chibai in bûk hun a tlung ding a ni tah."
22,Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.,"Nangnîn in hriet naw chibai in bûk hlak, keini chun chu kan ihriet chu chibai kan bûk hlak. Sandamna Judahaia inthawkin a hung suok ding a ni sih a."
23,"But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.","Chuongchun, a hun a tlung ding a ni tah, tu khawm hin a tlung zing tah, chu pha chun Pathien chibai bûktu taktakhaiin thlarau le titaktakin Pa chibai bûk an tih, Pa chun chuong ang mi chu ama chibai bûktu dingin a zawng a nih."
24,God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.,"Pathien chu Thlarau a nih; ama chibai bûktuhaiin thlarau le titak- takin chibai an bûk ding a nih,” a ta."
25,"The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.","Chun, nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Messie, Krista an ti chu a hung ding a nih ti ka hriet a, ama chu a hung phaleh iengkim mi la hril a tih,” a ta."
26,"Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Kei a betu che hi ama chu ka ni annâwm,” a ta."
27,"And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?","Chuong lai chun a închûktirhai chu an hung a, nuhmei a biek chu mak an ti hleh a; nisienlakhawm, tukhawmin, “Ieng am i zawng? Ieng- dinga nuhmei i biek am?” khawm an ti nawh."
28,"So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,","Chun, nuhmei chun a tuibêl a mâksan a, khuoah a feh a, mihai kuomah,"
29,"Come, see a man, who told me all things that ever I did: can this be the Christ?","“Ka thilthaw taphawt mi hril peitu mi pakhat a um a, hung unla, en ta u, Krista a ni thei âwm am?” a ta."
30,"They went out of the city, and were coming to him.","Chun, anni chu khuoa inthawk chun an hung suok a, a kuom tieng an pan tah a."
31,"In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.","Chu kâr chun inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, fa rawh,” an lo ti an lo tih a."
32,"But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “Bu in hriet naw fâk ding ka nei,” a ta."
33,"The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat?","Chun, inchûktirhai chu an inbiek a, “A fâk ding miin an hung chawipêk am a ni aw,” an in tih a."
34,"Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah a hril a, “A mi tirtu dit zâwng thaw le, a sin thaw zo ding hi ka bu a nih."
35,"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.","Nangnîn, ‘Bu sîkna ding thla li a la um,’ in ti a ni naw am a ni? Ngai ro, ka hril cheu hi, dâk unla, lohai en ro, tuta inthawkin sîk dingin a hmin a nih."
36,"He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.","A sîktu chun hlaw a hmu hlak a, chatuona hringna chena um dingin ra a sîk hlak, a tutu le a sîktu an lâwm rêl theina dingin."
37,"For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.","‘Pakhatin a tuh a, mi dangin a sîk hlak,’ ti thu hi, chutaka chun ân dik hle a nih."
38,"I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.","In inrimpui naw sîk dingin ka tir cheu hi; mi dangin a thawh a, nangnîn a thawsa chu in sunzawm a nih,” a ta."
39,"And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did.","Chun, nuhmei chun, “Ka thil- thaw po a mi hril pei,” tia ân hriet- tirna thu lei khan, chu khuoa um Samari mi tamtakin Isu an ring tah a."
40,"So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.","Chuongchun, Samari mihai chu Isu kuomah an hung a, an kuoma um dingin an ngên an ngên a; chuongchun, chutaka chun ni hni a châm a."
41,And many more believed because of his word;,"Chun, mi dang tamtakin ama thu leiin an ring ve tah a."
42,"and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.","Chun, anni chun, nuhmei kuoma chun, “Tu zet hin chu i thu hril leia ring kan ni ta nawh; keini ngeiin a thu hril kan hriet tah a, hi mipa hi khawvêl Sandamtu a ni ngei ti kan hriet tah,” an ta."
43,And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.,"Chun, chu ni hni hnunga chun chutaka inthawkin a suok a, Galili ramah a fe tah a."
44,"For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.","Isu ngeiin, zâwlnei chu ama khuo tieng chun chawimawiin a um ngai nawh ti ân hriettir hlak sih a."
45,"So when he came into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.","Chuongchun, Galili ram a hung tlungin Galili rama mihaiin an lo lâwm a, Jerusalema ruoiṭhe laia a thilthaw po po an hmu lei khan; anni khawm chu ruoiṭhenaa chun an fe ve sih a."
46,"He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.","Chun, Galili rama Kana khuo, tui uoina ân changtirna kha a hung tlung nâwk a. Chun, upa tû amanih a um a, a naupa Kapernaumah a damnawh a."
47,"When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.","Chun, Isu Judai rama in- thawkin Galili ramah a hung ti a hriet phingleh a hang feh a, a naupa zu sukdam dingin a ngên a, a thi vâng vâng sih a."
48,"Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.","Isûn a kuomah, “Inchiknahai le thilmakhai in hmu naw chun ring tawp naw ti niu,” a ta."
49,"The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.","Chun, upa chun a kuomah, “Pu, ka nau thi hmain hung thla ta la,” a ta."
50,"Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.","Isûn a kuomah, “Fe nâwk el ta rawh, i naupa chu a dam tah ie,” a ta. Ama chun Isûn a kuoma thu a hril chu a ring a, a fe tah a."
51,"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.","Chun, a fe thlâk lai zingin a suokhaiin ama an lo tuok a, “I naupa chu a dam tah,” an lo tih a."
52,"So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.","Ama chun an kuomah a dam phut hun lai ân dawn a. Anni chun a kuomah, “Zâni nisa inhêm chau khan a khawsik a bo tah a nih,” an ta."
53,"So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.","Chuongchun, a pain Isûn a kuoma, “I naupa chu a dam tah ie,” a ti lai tak chu a nih, ti a hriet tah a; chun, ama le a sûnghaiin an rêngin an ring tah a."
54,"This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judæa into Galilee.","Chu chu Isu thilmak a thaw vawi hnina a nih, Judai rama inthawka Galili rama a hungin."
