1,"After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.","Chuong thil hnunga chun Isu chu Galili dîl, Tiberi dîl an ti râlkhing tieng chun a fe tah a."
2,"And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.","Chun, damnaw chunga thilmak a thawhai chu an hmu leiin mipui tamtakin ama an zui a."
3,"And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.","Chun, Isu chu tlânga chun a hang feh a, chutaka chun a închûktirhai lai a ṭhung a."
4,"Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.",Fekân Ruoiṭhe (Judahai Ruoiṭhe chu) a hnai tah a.
5,"Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?","Chun, Isu a dâk a, mipui tamtakin a kuom tieng hung panin a hmuh a, Philip kuomah, “Hienghai fâk ding bei khâwlai am inchâwng ei ta?” a ta."
6,And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.,Chuong thu chu ama infiena dingin a hril a nih; a thaw ding chu amân a hriet zing sih a.
7,"Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings’ worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.","Philip chun a kuomah, “Mi tinin tlâwmtêa an chang seng ding khawm bei duli za hni manin dai naw ni,” a ta, a dawn a."
8,"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,","Chun, a închûktirhai laia mi pakhat Simon Peter unau Andri chun a kuomah,"
9,"There is a lad here, who hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?","“Buṭei beiphêk panga le nga pahni nei pasaltê pakhat hitaka hin a um; nisienlakhawm, mi hieng zozai lai hin chu chu ieng khawp am nîng a ta?” a ta."
10,"Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.","Chun, Isûn “Mihai chu inṭhung- tir ro,” a ta. Chu hmuna chun hlobet tamtak a um a. Chuongchun, patlinghai chu an ṭhung a; an tamzie chu sâng nga lai an nih."
11,"Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would.","Chun, Isûn beiphêkhai chu a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin a ṭhunghai lai chun a sem a, chuong ang bawkin ngahai khawm chu an dit tâwkin a sem bawk a."
12,"And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost.","Chun, an khawp hnungin, a inchûktirhai kuoma chun, “Ieng khawm inhmang lo dingin a mahla nawihai kha rût ro,” a ta."
13,"So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten.","Chuongchun, an rût a, buṭei bei- phêk panga fatuhai fâk mahla chun bâwm sâwm le pahni an suksip a."
14,"When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.","Chun, mihai chun thilmak a thaw chu an hmu phingleh, “Hi mipa hi zâwlnei, khawvêla hung ding kha a ni ngei hi,” an ta."
15,"Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone.","Chuongchun, ama chu lala siem dinga man el tumin an hung ding a nih ti Isûn a hriet a, tlângah ama khât chauin a tumin a fe nâwk tah a."
16,"And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea;","Chun, khuo a hung inhnu chun, a închûktirhai chu dîla chun an zu feh a."
17,"and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.","Lawngah an chuong a, dîla chun Kapernaum an pan a. Khuo a hung inthim tah a, Isu hlak chu an kuom a la tlung si nawh."
18,And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.,Thlipui nasatak a hrâng leiin tui chu a fâwn insâng deu deu a.
19,"When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid.","Chun, fîng sâwmhni panga amanih, fîng sâwmthum amanih an kar chun, Isu chu dîl chunga chun kea lâwna, lawng hung hnaiin an hmuh a, an ṭih a."
20,"But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “Kei ka nih annâwm, ṭi naw ro,” a ta."
21,They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going.,"Chuongchun, lawnga chun inchuongtir an nuom tah a; chun, kârloin lawng chun an pan khawmuol chu a tlung nghâl tah a."
22,"On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone","A zînga chun dîl râl khing tienga mipui ngîrhai chun, lawng pakhat naw chu lawng dang a um nawh a, Isu chu a închûktirhai lai lawnga chun a chuong ve nawh a, a închûktirhai anni khât chauin an fe ti an hriet a."
23,(howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks):,"(Nisienlakhawm, Lalpain lâwm- thu a hril hnunga, bei an fâkna hmun kâwla khan Tiberi khuoa in- thawkin lawng chînhai a hung tlung sih a)."
24,"when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.","Chuongchun, mipui chun Isu le a închûktirhai chu an um ta nawh ti an hrietin, anni khawm lawng chîn- haia chun an chuong a, Isu zawngin Kapernaum an hung tlung a."
25,"And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?","Chun, dîl râla an hung hmu chun a kuomah, “Rabbi, iengtik am hi tieng i lo tlung a?” an tih a."
26,"Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled.","Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, thilmakhai in hmu leia mi zawng in ni nawh a, bei in fâk khawp leia mi zawng in ni lem hi."
27,"Work not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed.","Bu bohmang nâwk el hlak zawng hin inlap rak rak naw ro, chatuona hringna chena um zing ding bu, Mihriem Naupain a pêk ding cheu chu zawng lem ro; Pa Pathien chun ama chu ân chik ta sih a,” a ta, a dawn a"
28,"They said therefore unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Pathien sin kan thaw theina dingin ieng am thâwng kan ta?” an ta."
29,"Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.","Isu chun an kuomah, “Pathien sin thaw chu hi hi a nih, a mi tir hi ring unla,” a ta, a dawn a."
30,"They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest thou?","Anni chun a kuomah, “Inchikna ieng am thâwng i ta, kan hmua kan ring theina ding chein? Thil ieng am thâwng i ta?"
31,"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.","Kan thlatuhaiin thlalêrah man- na kha an fâk hlak, ‘Vâna inthawk chun an kuomah bei fâk ding a pêk,’ ti ziek ang khan,” an ta."
32,"Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, vâna inthawka bei in hmu kha Mosie pêk cheu a ni nawh, ka Pa ruok chun vâna inthawkin bei tak tak a pêk cheu a ni hi."
33,"For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.","Pathien bei chu vâna inthawka hung ṭuma, khawvêl kuoma hringna petu hi a nih,” a ta."
34,"They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, chu bei chu kumkhuoin mi pe rawh,” an ta."
35,"Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kei hi hringna bei chu ka nih, tûkhawm ka kuoma hung chu phîngṭâm naw ni, tûkhawm a mi ring chu iengtika khawm dangchâr naw ni."
36,"But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not.","Nisienlakhawm, nangnîn in mi hmu khawma in mi ring si nawh ti ka hril cheu kha."
37,All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.,Pain a mi pêkhai po po ka kuomah hung vawng an tih; tûkhawm ka kuoma hung chu hnawt suok naw tawp ka tih.
38,"For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.","Mâni nuom zâwng thaw dinga vâna inthawka hung ka ni nawh a, a mi tirtu dit zâwng thaw dinga hung ṭum ka ni lem."
39,"And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.","Hi hi a mi tirtu dit zâwng chu a nih, amân a mi pêk po po iengkhawm inhmang naw lang, ni kin nia chun keitho lem lang."
40,"For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.","Chun, hi hi ka Pa dit zâwng a nih, tûkhawm Nau hmua ring taphawt chun chatuona hringna nei sienla; chun, keiin ni kin nia chun ama chu kei tho lang,” a ta."
41,"The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.","Chun, “Vâna inthawka bei hung ṭum chu ka nih,” a ti leiin, Judahai chu a chungah an chier a."
42,"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven?","“Hi mipa hi Josef nau Isu a ni naw am a nih? A nu le Pa khawm ei hriet hi. ‘Vâna inthawka hung ṭum ka nih,’ iengti tia ti am a ni leh?” an ta."
43,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Chier chier naw ro."
44,"No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.","Pa a mi tirtuin a hîp naw chun tukhawm ka kuomah hung thei naw ni hai; chun, keiin ni kin nia chun a hung chu keitho ka tih."
45,"It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me.","Zâwlneihai Lekhabuah, ‘Pa- thien inchûktirin um vawng an tih,’ ti ziek a nih. Mi tin Pa thu hrea inchûk taphawt chu ka kuomah an hung hlak."
46,"Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he that is from God, he hath seen the Father.","Tukhawmin Pa an hmu hlak ka ti nawh, Pathien kuoma inthawka hung suok chau naw hin chu; ama chun Pa chu a hmuh."
47,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm a ring chun chatuona hringna a nei tah a nih."
48,I am the bread of life.,Kei hi hringna bei chu ka nih.
49,"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.","“In thlatuhaiin thlalêrah man- na kha an fâk a, an thi tho a."
50,"This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.","Hi hi vâna inthawka bei hung ṭum chu a nih, mîn a fâka a thi nawna dingin."
51,"I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.","Kei hi vâna inthawka bei hring hung ṭum chu ka nih, tûkhawmin hi bei hi a fâk chun chatuonin hring zing a tih, anih, khawvêl hringna dinga ka ipêk ding bei chu, ka taksa hi a nih,” a ta."
52,"The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?","Chuongchun, Judahai an insêl a, “Hi mipa hin iengtin am a taksa fâk dingin mi pe thei a ta?” an ta."
53,"Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Mihriem Naupa taksa in fâka, a thisen in dâwn bawk naw chun, nangni khâtin hringna nei nghâl lo cheu."
54,He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.,"Tûkhawm, ka taksa faa, ka thisen dâwn chun, chatuona hringna a nei tah, chun, ni kin nia chun ama chu keitho ka tih."
55,"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.","Ka taksa hi bu tak a na, ka thisen hi dâwn ding tak a ni sih a."
56,"He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him.","Tûkhawm ka taksa faa, ka thisen dâwn chu, keimaah a um zing hlak, kei khawm amaah ka um zing hlak."
57,"As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me.","Pa hring chun a mi tir a, Pa zâra hring ka ni ang bawkin, tûkhawm a mi fa chu keia zârin hring vêng a tih."
58,"This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever.","Hi hi vâna inthawka bei hung ṭum chu a nih, chi thlatuhaiin bei an fâk ang kha a ni nawh, anni chun an fâka, an thi tah a; tûkhawm hi bei hi fa chu chatuonin hring zing a tih,” a ta."
59,"These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.","Chuong thu chu inkhâwmna inah a hril a, Kapernauma ân chûktir lai khan."
60,"Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?","Chuongchun, a închûktirhai tamtakin chuongchu an hrietin, “Hi hi thu khir tak a nih, tuin am ngai phâk an ta?” an ta."
61,"But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble?","Chuongchun, chu thua chun a închûktirhai an chier ti Isûn a lungrilin a hriet a, an kuomah, “Hi thu hin a suklungninaw cheu am a nih?"
62,What then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before?,Mihriem Naupa hi inhmaa a umna ngaia hang lâwna in hmu chun ieng am lâwng in ta?
63,"It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life.","Sukhringtu chu thlarau a nih, tisa chu ienga ṭhangkai a ni nawh; in kuoma thu ka hrilhai hi thlarau a nih, hringna khawm a nih."
64,"But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him.","Nisienlakhawm, nangni laia a ṭhen ring naw in um,” a ta. Isûn a ring nawtu le ama inmantirtu ding chu a tîra inthawkin a hriet zing sih a."
65,"And he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of the Father.","Chun, ama bawkin, “Chu lei chun a nih in kuomah, ‘Pain a ṭhang- pui naw chun, tukhawm ka kuomah hung thei naw ni hai,’ ka ti kha,” a ta."
66,"Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.","Chu phingle chun a închûk- tirhai tamtak an fe hmang a, ama an pâwl nâwk ta nawh a."
67,"Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would ye also go away?","Chuongchun, Isûn sâwm le pa- hnihai kuoma chun, “Nangni khawm fe hmang in nuom ve am?” a ta."
68,"Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.","Simon Peterin a kuomah, “Lal- pa, tu kuom am fêng kan ta? Nangin chatuona hringna thu i nei annâwm;"
69,And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God.,"Nang Pathien mi inthieng chu i nih ti kan awi tah a, hriet khawm kan hriet ie,” a ta, a dawn a."
70,"Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Nangni sâwm le pahnihai hi keia thlang in ni naw am a nih? Nangni laia pakhat diebol a ni nâwk nghâl si,” a ta."
71,"Now he spake of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.","(Simon Iskariot naupa Juda, sâwm le pahnihai laia ṭhang ve thu kha a hril a nih, ama chu ân mantirtu ding chu a ni sih a.)"
