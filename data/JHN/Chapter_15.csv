verse_no,en,hmr
1,"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.","“Kei grêp hrui tak tak ka nih, Ka Pa a huon enkawltu a nih."
2,"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit.","Ka zawmpui kâu ra naw taphawt chu a peihâwn hlak; a ra taphawt chu a sukthieng hlak, a ra tam nâwk zuolna dingin."
3,Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you.,In kuoma ka thu hril lei chun tu khawm hin in inthieng ta pang a nih.
4,"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.","Keimaah um zing ro, kei khawm nangniah um zing ka tih. Kâu chu grêp hruiah a um zing naw chun a khâtin a ra thei naw ang bawkin, nangni khawm keimaah in um zing naw chun ra thei naw ti niu."
5,"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.","Kei grêp hrui chu ka nih, nangni a kâuhai chu in nih, tûkhawm keimaa a um zing a, kei khawm amaa ka um zingna chu, ama chu tamtakin a ra hlak; ka ṭhang naw chun iengkhawm in thaw thei si nawh."
6,"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.","Mi keimaah a um zing naw chun kâu anga peihâwnin a um a, a vuoi hlak; chun, an inkhâwm a, meiah an pei a, a kâng hlak."
7,"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.","Nangni keimaa in um zing a, ka thu nangnia a um zing chun, in dit dit hni ro, in ta dingin thawin um pei a tih."
8,"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and so shall ye be my disciples.","Hi hi leiin ka Pa chu chawi- mawiin a um hlak, tamtaka in ra hin; chuongchun, ka închûktirhai nîng in tih."
9,"Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love.",“Pain a mi hmangai ang bawkin kei khawmin ka hmangai cheu hi; ka ihmangaiin um zing ro.
10,"If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.","Nangnîn ka thupêkhai in zâwm chun ka ihmangaiin um zing in tih; keiin ka Pa thupêkhai ka zâwm a, a ihmangaia ka um zing ang bawk hin."
11,"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.","Ka lâwm nangnia a um zingna ding le, in lâwm a kimna dingin hieng thu hi in kuomah ka hril hi."
12,"This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.","Hi hi ka thupêk a nih, keiin ka hmangai cheu ang bawkin, nangni inhmangai unla."
13,"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.",Mihriemin a ruol ta dinga a hringna a pêk nêka hmangaina nasa lem tukhawmin an nei nawh.
14,"Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you.","Thu ka pêk taphawt cheu in thaw chun, ka ruolhai nîng in tih."
15,No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father I have made known unto you.,Suok ti nâwk ta naw ning cheu; a pu thilthaw suok chun a hriet si nawh; ruolhai ka ti ta lem cheu a nih. Pa kuoma inthawka thil ka hriet po po in kuomah ka puong ta sih a.
16,"Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.","Nangnîn in mi thlang nawh a, keiin ka thlang lem cheu a, va ra ding le in ra chu um zing dingin ka ruot bawk cheu a nih; ka hminga Pa kuoma in hni taphawt a pêkna ding cheuin."
17,"These things I command you, that ye may love one another.",In inhmangai theina dingin hieng thu hi ka pêk cheu a nih.
18,"If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before it hated you.","“Khawvêlin a theida cheu chun, a theida hma cheu khawmin kei a mi theida tah ti hre ro."
19,"If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.","Nangni khawvêla mi ni unla, khawvêlin amaa mi a hmangai ding bah; khawvêla mi in ni si nawh a, khawvêla inthawka ka thlang suok lem cheu leiin, khawvêlin a theida cheu a nih."
20,"Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.","‘Suok a pu nêkin a ropui nawh,’ ti thu ka hril ta cheu kha hre zing ro. Annîn kei an mi suknawmna ta chun, nangni khawm suknawmnâng an ti cheu; ka thu an zâwm ta chun nangni thu khawm zâwm an tih."
21,"But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.","Nisienlakhawm, hieng thil po po hi ka hming leiin in chungah thâwng an tih, keia mi tirtu an hriet naw leiin."
22,"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.",Kei hungin an kuomah thu hril naw lang chu suol an nei naw ding bah; tu ruok hin chu an suol suonlam ding an nei ta naw a nih.
23,He that hateth me hateth my Father also.,Tûkhawm kei mi theida chun ka Pa khawm a theida a nih.
24,"If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.","Thil, mi dang tukhawm ithaw ngainawhai anni lai thaw naw lang chu, suol an nei naw ding bah; tu ruok hin chu annîn kei le ka Pa kan pahniin an mi hmu tah a, theida khawm an mi theida tah a nih."
25,"But this cometh to pass, that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.","Ieng khawm ni sien, an Dân Lekhabuah, ‘Annîn a san boin an mi theida,’ ti thu ziek kha, a hung tlungna dingin an thaw a ni hi."
26,"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me:","“Chun, ka Pa kuoma inthawka Thlamuongtu in kuoma ka hung tir ding, Paa suok Thlarau indiktak chu, a hung tlung pha, ama chun ka thu inhriettir a tih;"
27,"and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.","nangni khawmin inhriettir bawk in tih, a tîra inthawk ka kuoma in um leiin."
