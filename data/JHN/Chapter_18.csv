1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.","Isûn chuong thu chu a hril zoin, a închûktirhai leh an suok a, Kidron vadung an kai a. Chu- taka chun huon a um a, chutaka chun an lût a, ama le a închûktirhai leh."
2,"Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples.","Chun, ân mantirtu ding Juda khawm chun chu hmun chu a hriet; Isu a închûktirhai leh chutaka chun a lêng rawp leiin."
3,"Judas then, having received the band of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.","Chuongchun, Juda chun sipai pâwl leh, thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai kuoma um manmihai leh a ṭhuoi a, khâwnvarhai, meiserhai, hriemhai chawiin chutaka chun an hung a."
4,"Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye?","Isûn a chunga thil tlung ding po po chu a hriet zing a, a va suok a, an kuomah, “Tu am in zawng a?” a ta."
5,"They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Nazareth Isu,” an ta, an dawn a. Isûn an kuom- ah, “Kei hi ka nih,” a ta. Chun, ân mantirtu Juda khawm chu anni lai a ngîr a."
6,"When therefore he said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.","Isûn, “Kei hi ka nih,” a ti phing- leh, hnungtieng an intâwl a, hnuoiah an tlu tâwl a."
7,"Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.","Isu chun an kuomah, “Tu am in zawng a?” a ti nâwk a. Anni chun, “Nazareth Isu,” an ta."
8,"Jesus answered, I told you that I am he; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:","Chun, Isûn, “Kei hi ka nih ti ka hril cheu annâwm, nangnîn kei in mi zawng chun, hienghai hi inthla ṭha ro,” a ta, a dawn a."
9,"that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.","(A thu hril, “Nangin kei i mi pêkhai pakhat khawm kân hmang nawh,” a ti kha a tlungna dingin.)"
10,"Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.","Chun, Simon Peterin kâwl- hnâm a kawl a, a phawi a, Thiempu Laltak suok a sât a, a nakâwr changtieng a sât thlâkpêk a. Suokpa hming chu Malka a nih."
11,"Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?","Chuongchun, Isûn Peter kuom- ah, “Kâwlhnâm kha a bâwmah thun rawh; Pain no, kei a mi pêk hi ka dâwn naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
12,"So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,","Chuongchun, sipai pâwl leh, an hotu laltak leh, Judahai manmihai le chun Isu an man a, an khuop a,"
13,"and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.","Ana kuomah an ṭhuoi hmasah a, Kaiapha tarpupa a ni leiin, Kaiapha chu, chu kum chun Thiempu Laltak a nih."
14,"Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.","Kaiapha chu, “Mi po po aia mi pakhat thi a ṭha,” tia Judahai rawtpuitu kha a nih."
15,"And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;","Chun, Simon Peterin Isu a zui a, a închûktir dang pakhat leh. Chu inchûktir chu Thiempu Laltak hmêlhriet a na, Thiempu Laltak in inhuon sûng tuolah Isu kuomah a lût veh a,"
16,"but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.","nisienlakhawm, Peter chu tuol- ah kawtkhâr bulah a ngir zing a. Chuongchun, inchûktir dang, Thiem- pu Laltak hmêlhriet chu, a va suok a, kawtkhâr vêngtu a biek a, Peter a ṭhuoi lût a."
17,"The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.","Chun, kawtkhâr vêngtu nu- nghâk chun Peter kuomah, “Nang khawm hi mipa inchûktir laia ṭhang ve i ni maw?” a ta. Ama chun, “Ka ni nawh,” a ta."
18,"Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.","Chun, suokhai le manmihai chu chutaka chun an ngîr tâwl a, a dei leiin meihawlin mei an sêm a, a lum an awi a, Peter khawm anni lai a ṭhang a, ngîr pumin mei lum a awi veh a."
19,"The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun Isu chu a inchûktirhai chanchin le a închûktirzie chanchin ân dawn a."
20,"Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.","Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Khawvêl kuomah, tlâng hrietah thu ka hril hlak kha; inkhâwmna in le, Pathien biekin, Juda po po um khâwmnaahai chun, kân chûktir rawp hlak kha, iengkhawm inrûkin ka hril nawh."
21,"Why askest thou me? ask them that have heard me, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.","Iengdinga kei i mîn dawn am? An kuomah ka thu hrilzie chu ka thu hretuhai indawn rawh; ngai rawh, chuonghai chun ka thu hril chu an hriet annâwm,” a ta."
22,"And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?","Chu chu a hril phingleh, a kâwla ngîr manmi pakhatin Isu a ben a, “Thiempu Laltak hieng ang hin i dawn maw?” a ta."
23,"Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?","Isûn a kuomah, “Thu suol ka hril leh, ka suolna mîn hriettir rawh, nisienlakhawm, thu ṭha ka hril khawmin iengdinga i mi ben am?” a ta, a dawn a."
24,Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.,"Chun, Ana chun khuop pumin Thiempu Laltak Kaiapha kuomah a tir a."
25,"Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.","Chun, Simon Peterin ngîrin mei lum a awi a. Chun, “Nang khawm a inchûktir laia ṭhang ve i ni maw?” an ta. Ama chun, “Ka ni nawh,” tiin ân phah a."
26,"One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?","Chun, Thiempu Laltak suok pakhat, Peterin a nakâwr a sât thlâk pêkpa laibungpa chun, “A kuomah huona khan ka hmu naw che am a nih?” a ta."
27,Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.,"Chuongchun, Peter ân pha nâwk a, âr a khuong tah a."
28,"They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Prætorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Prætorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.","Chun, Isu chu Kaiapha ina inthawk chun lal inah an ṭhuoi nâwk a. Zingkâr a na; chun anni chu lal inah an lût nawh, chuong naw chun, inthieng naw nîng an ta, Fekân Ruoiṭhe fa thei naw ni hai."
29,"Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?","Chun, Pilat an kuomah a va suok a, an kuomah, “Hi mipa chunga hin thupawi ieng am in nei a?” a ta."
30,"They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Hi mipa hi mi suol ni naw sien chu i kuomah hung ṭhuoi naw ning ungah,” an ta, an dawn a."
31,"Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:","Pilat chun an kuomah, “Nangnîn ṭhuoi unla, in dân angin a thu rêl ro,” a ta. Judahai chun a kuomah, “Keini thu chun tukhawm sukhlum dân a ni nawh,” an ta."
32,"that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die.","(A thizie ding thu, Isûn a hril anga, a tlungna dingin)."
33,"Pilate therefore entered again into the Prætorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?","Chuongchun, Pilat chu a inah a lût nâwk a. Isu a ko a, a kuomah, “Judahai lal i ni maw?” a ta."
34,"Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?","Isûn “Hihi nanga lungril puoksuoka i hril am a ni, mi dangin an hril che, ka chunga thu hi?” a ta, a dawn a."
35,"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?","Pilatin, “Kei Juda am ka nih? nangma chihai le thiempu lalhaiin ka kuomah an hung ṭhuoi che a ni hi, thil ieng am i thaw hrim leh?” a ta, a dawn a."
36,"Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.","Isûn, “Ka ram chu hi khawvêla mi hi a ni nawh; ka ram chu hi khawvêla mi hi ni sienla, ka rawi- haiin thâwng an tih, Judahai laia pêka ka um nawna dingin; nisienlakhawm, ka ram chu hitaka mi hi a ni nawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
37,"Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.","Chun, Pilatin a kuomah, “Chu lal i ni am a nih?” a ta. Isûn, “Lal ka nizie i hril zing chu. Thutak inhriettir hi ka pieng san le khawvêla ka hung san a nih. Tukhawm thutaka mi taphawt chun ka thu an pawm hlak,” a ta."
38,"Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him.","Pilatin a kuomah, “Thutak chu ieng am a na?” a ta. Chun, chu thu chu a hril phingleh, Judahai kuomah a va suok nâwk a, an kuomah, “Iengkhawm a suol ka hmu nawh."
39,"But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?","Nisienlakhawm, Fekân Ruoi- ṭheah mi pakhat kân suopêk ding cheuin dân in nei; chuongchun, Judahai lal hi insuopêk lang cheu in nuom am?” a ta."
40,"They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.","Chun, anni chu an khêk nâwk a, “Hi mipa hi chu ni naw raw se, Barabba kha ni lem raw se,” an ta. Barabba chu suomhmang a nih."
