1,"Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.","Chun, mi pakhat, Mari le a zuorpuinu Martha umna khuo Bethania mi, Lazar damnaw a um a."
2,"And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.","(Mari, hriek rim inhnik Lal chu nâla, a sama a ke hrutu kha, kha minu ṭapa Lazar a nih dam naw chu.)"
3,"The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.","Chun, a farnuhaiin Isu kuomah, “Lalpa, ngai ta, i hmangai kha a damnaw ie,” tiin mi an tir a."
4,"But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.","Isûn chu chu a hriet a, “Hi natna hi thina ding a ni nawh, Pathien ropuina ding a ni lem, Pathien Naupa chu hi lei hin a la mawina dingin,” a ta."
5,"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.","Chun, Isûn Martha hai, a zuor- puinu hai, Lazar hai a hmangai a."
6,"When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.","Chuleiin, a damnaw ti a hrietin a umna ngaiah ni hni a la um ta rawp a."
7,"Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judæa again.","Chun, chu hnunga chun a închûktirhai kuomah, “Judai ramah fe nâwk ei tiu,” a ta."
8,"The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?","Chun, inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Rabbi, kha hma el khan Judahaiin lunga dêng an tum che kha; chuong sa sa chun chutaka chun i la fe rawp ding am a nih?” an ta."
9,"Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.","Isûn, “Sûnah dârkâr sâwm le pahni a um naw am a nih? Mi sûnah a lêng chun a pêm ngai nawh, hi khawvêl var hi a hmu leiin."
10,"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.","Amiruokchu, mi zânah a lêng chun a pêm hlak, amaa chun var a um naw leiin,” a ta, a dawn a."
11,"These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.","Chuong thu chu a hril a; chun, chu hnunga chun an kuomah, “Ei ruolpa Lazar chu a ininnghil tah a; a ininnghil keihar dingin ka fe ding a nih,” a ta."
12,"The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.","Chuongchun, inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Lalpa a ininnghil a ni chun dam nâwk el a tih,” an ta."
13,Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.,"(Isûn a thi thu a hril a nih; nisienlakhawm, anni chun a châwl sûnga a ininnghil thu a hril amanih an ta.)"
14,"Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.","Chuongchun, Isûn fietakin an kuomah a hril a, “Lazar a thi a nih."
15,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.","Chutaka ka um naw chu ka lâwm pêk cheu, in ring theina dingin; nisienlakhawm, a kuomah fêng ei tiu,” a ta."
16,"Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.","Chun, Thoma (Didum an ti bawk) chun, ân chûktir chanpuihai kuomah, “A thinaa thi ve dingin fe vêng ei tiu,” a ta."
17,"So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.","Chuongchun, Isûn a tlung chun, ni li thlânah a lo um tah ti a hriet a,"
18,"Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;","Bethani chu Jerusalem kâwl a na, fing sâwmpanga laia hla a nih;"
19,"and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.","chuongchun, an ṭapa thi chunga sukthlamuong dingin Judahai rawi tamtak Martha le Mari kuomah an hung a."
20,"Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.",Martha chun Isu a hung ding a nih ti a hriet phingleh a va tuok a; Mari ruok chu inah a la ṭhung zing a.
21,"Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.","Chun, Martha chun Isu kuomah, “Lalpa hitaka um ni la chu, ka ṭapa a thi naw ding bah."
22,"And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.","Tukhawm hin Pathien kuoma i ngên taphawt chu Pathienin pêng a ti che ti ka hriet,” a ta."
23,"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.","Isûn a kuomah, “I ṭapa tho nâwk a tih,” a ta."
24,"Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.","Martha chun a kuomah, “Ni kin nia, thonâwknaa chun thonâwk a tih ti ka hriet,” a ta."
25,"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Kei hi thonâwkna le hringna chu ka nih; tûkhawm a mi ring chu thi sienla khawm hring zing a tih;"
26,and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?,tukhawm a hring taphawt a mi ring chu kumkhuoin thi naw nih; chu thu chu i ring am?” a ta.
27,"She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, even he that cometh into the world.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Ring e Lalpa, Krista, Pathien Naupa, khawvêla hung ding chu i ni ti ka ring ie,” a ta."
28,"And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.","Chun, chu thu chu a hril zo phingleh a feh a, a zuorpuinu Mari chu inrûkin a va ko a, “Inchûktirtu hitakah a um a, a ko che,” a ta."
29,"And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.","Ama chun chu chu a hriet phingleh a tho vak a, a kuomah a va feh a."
30,"(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)","(Isu chu khuo a la lût nawh a, Marthain a va tuok laia, a umna ngaiah a la um a.)"
31,"The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.","In sûnga a thlamuongtu a umpui Judahai chun, Mari a tho vaka, a suok an hmu phingleh, thlâna ṭap dingin a fe amanih an ta, an zui a."
32,"Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.","Chun, Mari chun Isu umna chu a va tlung a, a hmu phingleh a ke bulah a bawkkhup a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, hitaka um ni la chu ka ṭapa a thi naw ding bah,” a ta."
33,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,","Isu chun Mari ṭap le a hung zuitu Judahai ṭap chu a hmuin, a lungrilin ân rûm a, a lungngai a."
34,"and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.","“Ama chu khâwlai am in inzâl a?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, hung la, en ta,” an ta."
35,Jesus wept.,Isu a ṭap tah a.
36,"The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!","Chun, Judahai chun, “En ta u, Lazar hi a lo va hmangai deh e!” an ta."
37,"But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?","Nisienlakhawm, ṭhenkhat chun, “Hi mitdel mit sukvartu hin, hi mipa khawm hi ân thi naw tir thei naw am a nih?” an ta."
38,"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.","Chun, Isu chu a lungrilin ân rûm nâwk a, thlân chu a tlung tah a. Chu thlân chu pûk a na, a kawtkhâra chun lung pakhat a um a."
39,"Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been dead four days.","Isûn, “Lung hi dawm tâwl ro,” a ta. A thipa farnu Martha chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, tuhin chu thu tâng a tih, a thina ni li a ni ta sih a,” a ta."
40,"Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?","Isûn a kuomah, “I ring chun Pathien ropuizie hmûng i tih, ka ti naw che am a nih?” a ta."
41,"So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.","Chuongchun, lung chu an dawm tâwl a. Chun, Isu a dâk a, “Pa, ka thu i ngai leiin i chungah ka lâwm ie."
42,"And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.","Kumkhuoin ka thu i ngai hlak ti ka hriet zing a nih; nisienlakhawm, mipui ngîr khup lei hin chu chu ka ti a nih, nangin i mi tir ti an ring theina dingin,” a ta."
43,"And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.","Chun, chuonga a ṭawng zo phingleh râwl inringtakin, “Lazar, hung suok rawh,” a ta, a khêk a."
44,"He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.","Mithi chu a kut a ke thlân puona tuom pumin a hung suok tah a, a hmai chu inhrûkna puona tuom a nih. Isûn an kuomah, “Sût unla, infetir ro,” a ta."
45,"Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.","Chuleichun, Mari lêngpuitu Isu thilthaw hmu Juda mi tamtakin Isu an ring tah a."
46,"But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.","Nisienlakhawm, a ṭhen Phari- saihai kuomah an va feh a, an kuomah Isu thilthawhai chu an hril a."
47,"The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.","Chuongchun, thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai chun rorêltuhai an ko khâwm a, “Iengtin am thâwng ei ta? Hi mipa hin thilmak tamtak a thaw sih a."
48,"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.","Hieng anga ei thlathlam el chun mi po poin ama ring an ta; chun, Roma mihai hung an ta, ei hmun le ei chihai hi mi lâkpêk an tih,” an ta."
49,"But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,","Chun, anni laia mi pakhat, Kaiapha, chu kuma Thiempu Laltak chun an kuomah, “Nangnîn ieng- khawm in hriet dêr nawh."
50,"nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.","Ei chi po po bohmang nawna dingin, mi po po nêka mi pakhat thi in ta dingin a ṭha ti in ngaituo bawk nawh,” a ta."
51,"Now this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;","(Chu thu chu ama phuok- fâwmin a hril nawh, chu kum chun Thiempu Laltak a na, an chihai nêka Isu a thi ding thu a hril lâwk a ni lem."
52,"and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.","Chuhai chihai ai chau chun a ni nawh, Pathien nau khawvêla indarhai po po pâwl khata a ṭhuoi khâwmna dingin a ni bawk.)"
53,So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.,"Chuongchun, chu ni chena inthawk chu ama sukhlum dingin an inrâwn rawp a."
54,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.","Chuleiin, Isu chu Judahai lai ân langin a lêng nâwk ta nawh a, chutaka inthawkin thlalêr dep tienga khaw pakhat Ephraim an tia chun a va fe ta lem a; chutaka chun inchûktirhai leh an um ta zing a."
55,"Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.","Chun, Judahai Fekân Ruoiṭhe chu a hnai tah a, mi tamtak inthien dingin rama inthawk, Fekân Ruoiṭhe hma chun, Jerusalemah an hang feh a."
56,"They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?","Chuongchun, Isu an zawng a, Pathien biekinah ngir pumin an inbiek a, “Ieng am in ring a? Ruoi- ṭhenaah hung naw ni maw?” an in tih a."
57,"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.",Thiempu Lalhai le Pharisai- haiin ama chu an man theina dingin tûkhawmin a umna an hriet chun phuong ding a nih ti thu an pêk ta sih a.
