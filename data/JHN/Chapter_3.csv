1,"Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:","Chun, Pharisaihai laia mi, a hming Nikodem, Judahai hotu pakhat a um a;"
2,"the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.","ama chu zânah Isu kuomah a hung a, a kuomah, “Rabbi, Pathiena inthawka inchûktirtua hung i ni ti kan hriet; Pathien an chungah a um naw chun hieng thilmak i thawhai hi tukhawmin thaw thei naw ni hai,” a ta."
3,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.","Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Titak- zetin, titakzetin ka hril che hi mi tûkhawm an pieng thar naw chun, Pathien ram hmu thei naw ni hai,” a ta."
4,"Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?","Nikodemin a kuomah, “Mi a tar hnungin iengtin am pieng thei a ta? A nu sulah vawi hni lûtin a pieng ding am a nih?” a ta."
5,"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.","Isûn a dawn a, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril che hi, mi tûkhawm tuia le Thlaraua an pieng naw chun Pathien ramah lût thei naw ni hai,"
6,That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.,"tisaa pieng taphawt tisa a nih, Thlaraua pieng taphawt chu thlarau a nih."
7,"Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.",In pieng thar ding ka ti che hi mak ti naw rawh.
8,"The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.","Thli khâwlai khawm a nuom nuomin a hrâng hlak, a ri i hriet deh, nisienlakhawm, khâwtaka inthawka hung am, khâwlai am a fe ding ti i hriet si nawh; tûkhawm Thlaraua pieng chu chuong ang chu an nih,” a ta."
9,"Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?","Chun, Nikodemin a dawn a, a kuomah, “Chuong thil chu iengtin am um thei a ta?” a ta."
10,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?","Isûn a dawn a, a kuomah, “Israelhai inchûktirtu i ni sih a, chuong chu i hriet naw maw?"
11,"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril che hi, keinîn kan hriet chu kan hril hlak, kan hmu chu kan inhriettir hlak; nisienlakhawm, kan thu inhriettir in awi ngai si nawh."
12,"If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?","Khawvêla thil ka hril hmana awi lo cheu a, vâna thil hril lang cheu iengtin am awi in ta?"
13,"And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven.","Vânah tukhawm an lâwn ngai nawh, vâna inthawka hung ṭum Mihriem Naupa chau naw hi chu."
14,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;","“Chun, Mosiein thlalêra rûl a khai kâng ang khan, Mihriem Naupa hi khai kângin a um bawk ding a nih;"
15,that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.,tûkhawm a ring taphawt chun ama leia chatuona hringna an neina dingin.
16,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.","Pathienin khawvêl a hmangai bêk bêk a, chuongchun, a Naupa khât nei sun chu a pêk a, ama chu tûkhawm a ring taphawt chu an bohmang nawh a, chatuona hringna an nei lemna dingin."
17,For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.,"Khawvêl thiemnaw inchangtir dingin Pathienin a Nau khawvêlah a tir nawh, khawvêl ama leia an dam theina dingin a tir a ni lem."
18,"He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.","“Tûkhawm ama ring chu inthiemloin um naw ni hai, tukhawm a ring naw chu tuta inthawkin in- thiemloin an um nghâl a nih, Pathien Naupa khât nei hming an ring naw leiin."
19,"And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.","Hi hi thiemnawna a nih, var khawvêlah a hung a, nisienlakhawm, mihaiin var nêkin inthim an dit lem a, an thilthawhai a suol leiin."
20,"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.","Tûkhawm thil suksuol taphawt chun var an theida hlak, vara khawm an hung nawh, chuong naw chun, an thilthawhai inlang a tih."
21,"But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.","Amiruokchu tûkhawm a thaw dik phawt chu, an thilthawhai Pathien leia thaw an ni ti ân langna dingin, varah an hung hlak,” a ta."
22,"After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.","Chuong hnunga chun Isu chu a inchûktirhai leh Judai ramah an feh a, chutaka chun Isu an kuomah a um zing a, a baptis hlak a."
23,"And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.","Johan khawmin Ainonah, Salim kâwlah, a baptis bawk a, chutaka chun tui a tam leiin, chun, mi an hung a, baptisma an chang tâwl a."
24,For John was not yet cast into prison.,Chuong lai chun Johan intâng- na inah an la khum si nawh.
25,There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purifying.,"Chun, Johan inchûktirhai le Juda pakhat inthien dân thuah an lo insêl a."
26,"And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.","Johan kuomah an hung a, a kuomah, “Rabbi, Jordan râla i kuoma um, a thu mi în hriettir khan, ngai ta, kha pa khan mi a baptis a, mi po po a kuomah an hung a nih,” an ta."
27,"John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.","Johanin a dawn a, “Mihriemin iengkhawm an nei thei nawh, vâna mi pêk a ni naw chun,"
28,"Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.","‘Kei Krista ka ni nawh, a hmaa mi tir ka nih,’ ka ti kha nangni ngei a mi hrietpuitu in nih."
29,"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.","Moneitu chu a pasal chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, pasal ṭhien ngîr puma a thu hretu chu, pasal râwl leiin a lâwm bêk bêk hlak; hi ka lâwmna a tlung tah a ni hi."
30,"He must increase, but I must decrease.","Ama chu tlatlum ding a nih, kei ruok chu inlâng ding ka nih."
31,"He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.","“Chung tienga hung chu mi po po nêka chunghnungtak a nih; hnuoia pieng chu hnuoia mi a nih, hnuoi thu a hril hlak, vâna inthawka hung chu mi po po nêka chunghnungtak a nih."
32,"What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.",A hmu le a hriet taphawt ân hriettir hlak a nih; tukhawmin a thu inhriettir an awi nawh.
33,"He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to this, that God is true.","A thu inhriettir awi chun, ‘Pathien chu mi indiktak a nih,’ tiin a hming namin a ziek."
34,For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.,Pathien itir chun Pathien thu a hril hlak; ama chu Pathienin inkhi kherin Thlarau a pêk si nawh.
35,"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.","Pa chun Nau a hmangai a, a kutah iengkim a rêngin a pêk tah."
36,"He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.","Tûkhawm Nau ring taphawt chun chatuona hringna an nei tah, nisienlakhawm, tûkhawm Nau thu awi naw taphawt chun hringna nei naw hi hai, Pathien lunginsenna an chungah a um zing lem a nih,” a ta."
