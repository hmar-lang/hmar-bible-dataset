1,After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested himself on this wise.,"Chun chu hnunga chun, Tiberi dîlah Isu a inchûktirhai kuomah ân lâr nâwk a; hieng ang hin ân lâr;"
2,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.","Simon Peter hai, Thoma (Didum an ti bawk) hai, Galili rama Kana khuoa mi Nathanael hai, Zebedai naupahai pahni, a închûktirhai pahni dang leh an um khâwm a."
3,"Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.","Simon Peter chun an kuomah, “Nga manin ka fe ding a nih,” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Keini khawm i kuomah hung vêng kan tih,” an ta. An fe suok a, lawngah an chuong a; chu zân chun iengkhawm an man nawh."
4,"But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.","Chun, khawfing chatin Isu ṭieuphoah a ngîr a; nisienlakhawm, a închûktirhai chun Isu a nih ti an hriet si nawh."
5,"Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Nauhai, iengkhat fâk ding in nei am?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Nei lo,” an ta, an dawn a."
6,"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Lawng sîr changtieng khan lên dêng unla, hmûng in tih,” a ta. Chun, an dêng a, nga tam lei chun an kei dawk zo ta nawh a."
7,"That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.","Chuongchun, inchûktir Isûn a ihmangai khan Peter kuomah, “Lalpa a ni saw,” a ta. Chuongchun, Lalpa a nih ti Simon Peter chun a hriet phingleh, a silfên ân bel a, (ruoka um a ni sih a,) dîlah ân châwm thla tah a."
8,"But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net full of fishes.","Nisienlakhawm, inchûktir dang- hai chun lawng chîtê têhai chun, lên nga puma hnûk pei pum chun an hung pan a, (khawmuola inthawkin a hla si nawh a, tawng za hni amani chau a nih)."
9,"So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.","Chun, khawmuola an suok phingleh, chutaka chun meihawla mei insêm an hmuh a, a chunga nga le beiphêk raw leh."
10,"Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Tuhin in nga man kha a ṭhen hung la ro,” a ta."
11,"Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.","Chuongchun, Simon Peter a va chuong a, lên chu nga lien tak taka sipin khawmuolah a hnûk dawk a, za le sâwmnga le pathum a nih; chuong zât zât um sien khawm lên chu ân ek si nawh."
12,"Jesus saith unto them, Come and break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Zîngbu hung fa ro,” a ta. Inchûktirhai laia tukhawmin a kuomah, “Tu am i na?” tiin an indawn ngam nawh, Lalpa a nih ti an hriet zing a."
13,"Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.","Chun, Isu a hung a, beiphêk chu a lâk a, an kuomah a pêk a, ngahai khawm chu chuong ang bawkin a pêk a."
14,"This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.",Chu chu Isu mithi laia inthawk- a a thonâwk hnunga a închûktirhai kuoma ân lâr a vawi thumna a nih.
15,"So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.","Chun, zingbu an fâk zoin, Isûn Simon Peter kuomah, “Simon, Johan naupa, hienghai nêk hin nangin kei i mi hmangai lem am?” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “Aw, Lalpa, ka ngaina che ti I hriet,” a ta. Ama chun a kuom- ah, “Ka berâmtehai châwm rawh,” a ta."
16,"He saith to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.","A vawihninaah, a kuomah, “Simon, Johan naupa, nangin kei i mi hmangai am?” a ti nâwk a. Ama chun a kuomah, “Aw, Lalpa, ka ngaina che ti i hriet,” a ti nâwk a. Ama chun a kuomah, “Ka berâmhai enkawl rawh,” a ta."
17,"He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.","A vawithumnaa chun, “Simon, Johan naupa, nangin kei i mi ngaina am?” a ta. Chun, a vawithumnaah “Nangin i mi ngaina am,” a kuoma a ti lei chun Peter a lungngai a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, iengkim i hriet a, ka ngaina che ti i hriet,” a ta. Isûn a kuomah, “Ka berâmhai châwm rawh."
18,"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril che, i naupang lai khan i kâwngah în khit a, i nuomna tieng tieng i fe hlak; nisienlakhawm, i upat pha i kuthai phar i ta, mi dangin khitpêk an ti cheh a, i nuom nawna tieng kei an ti che,” a ta."
19,"Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.","Chuong thu chu iengtiziea thiin am Pathien a chawimawi ding ti inhriettirna dingin a hril a nih. Chun, chu chu a hril zoin a kuomah, “Mi zui rawh,” a ta."
20,"Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?","Chun, Peter chu a nghah a, Isûn inchûktir a ihmangai, zânbu fâk laia a âwm hnenga hung thlea, “ân mantirtu ding che chu tu tak am nîng a ta?” titu khan a hung zui a hmuh a."
21,"Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?","Peterin ama chu a hmu chun Isu kuomah, “Lalpa hi mipa hin ieng am thâwng a ta?” a ta."
22,"Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.","Isûn a kuomah, “Ka hung nâwk chena um zing dingin dit lang lem chu, chu chu ienga i hmang ding am a na? Nangin mi zui el rawh,” a ta."
23,"This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?","Chuongchun, chu inchûktir chu thi naw dingin a thu unauhai lai ân thang tah a. Nisienlakhawm, Isûn thi naw ni ti a kuomah a hril si nawh, “Ka hung nâwk chena um zing dingin dit lang lem chu, chu chu ienga i hmang ding am a na?” a ti el a ni sih a."
24,"This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.",24 Chu inchûktir chu hieng thu ziektu le inhriettirtu hi a nih; a thu inhriettir hi indiktak a nih ti ei hriet.
25,"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.","Chun, hieng naw hi Isu thilthaw dang tamtak a la um, chuongchu ziek fai vawng ding ni sien, lekhabu ziek ding po po chu khawvêla khawm hin inlengin ka ring nawh."
