1,"Now on the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.","Chun, ni saria ni hmasatakah, zîngkâr, khuo a lân thim laiin, Mari Magdalin chu thlâna chun a va feh a, lung chu thlâna inthawka lâk sawnin a hmuh a."
2,"She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.","Chuongchun, a tlân a, Simon Peter le inchûktir dang Isûn a ihmangai kuoma chun a hung a, an kuomah, “Thlâna inthawk khan Lalpa chu an fe hmangpui tah, an siena chin hrim kan hriet nawh,” a ta."
3,"Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.","Chuongchun, Peter chu a suok a, inchûktir dang le chun; chun, thlântieng an pan tah a."
4,"And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;","An tlân rêl a, inchûktir dang chun Peter a lekhêl a, thlân chu a tlung hmasah a."
5,"and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.","A kûn a, a bih a, puon zai inhmi um chu a hmuh a; nisienlakhawm, a sûngah a lût nawh."
6,"Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,","Chun, Simon Peter khawmin a hnungah a hung hnawt phâk a, thlân sûngah a lût a; puon zai inhmihai um le"
7,"and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.","a lua inhrûkna puon um chu, puon zai inhmihai laia um loin, ziel sain hmun tuma um a hmuh a."
8,"Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.","Chuongchun, inchûktir dang, thlân tlung hmasapa khawm chu a lût veh a, a hmuh a, a awi a."
9,"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.",Mithi laia inthawkin a thonâwk ding a ni ti Pathien Lekha Thu kha an la hriet si nawh a.
10,So the disciples went away again unto their own home.,"Chuongchun, inchûktirhai chu anni inah an fe nâwk tah a."
11,"But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;","Nisienlakhawm, Mari chu tuol- ah thlân kâwla chun ṭap pumin a ngîr a; chuongchun, ṭap pumin a kûn a, thlân sûng chu a bih a;"
12,"and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.","chun, vântirko pahni puon vâr silin, Isu ruong inzâlna hmuna chun, pakhat a lu tieng, pakhat a ke tienga ṭhung a hmuh a."
13,"And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Nuhmei, iengdinga i ṭap am?” an ta. Ama chun an kuomah, “Ka Lalpa an fe- hmangpui a, an siena chin ka hriet naw leiin,” a ta."
14,"When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.","Chun, chuonga a hril phingleh a hnung tieng a nghah a, Isu ngîr chu a hmuh a, Isu a ni ti a hriet si nawh a."
15,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.","Isûn a kuomah, “Nuhmei, ieng- dinga i ṭap am? Tû am i zawng a?” a ta. Ama chun huon enkawltu amanih a tih a, a kuomah, “Pu, ama hitaka inthawka i fepui a ni chun i siena chin mi hril rawh, chuongchun lâng ka tih,” a ta."
16,"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.","Isûn a kuomah, “Mari,” a tih a. Ama chu a nghah a, a kuomah, Hebrai ṭawngin, “Rabboni,” a ta; (chu chu Inchûktirtu tina a nih.)"
17,"Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Mi chel naw rawh, tu chen khawmin Pa kuomah ka la hang fe nawh; amiruokchu, ka unauhai kuomah va fe la, an kuomah, ‘Ka pa, in Pa, Ka Pathien, in Pathien kuomah ka lâwn ding a nih,’ a tih, va ti rawh,” a ta."
18,"Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and that he had said these things unto her.","Mari Magdalin chu a va feh a, închûktirhai kuomah, “Lalpa chu kan hmu tah,” a ta, a kuoma thu a hrilziehai khawm chu a hril a."
19,"When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.","Chun, chu ni, ni saria ni hmasatakah, khuo a hung inhnu chun, Judahai ṭi leia inchûktirhai umna kawtkhârhai chu khâr a ni hnungin, Isu anni lai a hung ngîr a, an kuomah, “In chungah thla- muongna um raw se,” a ta."
20,"And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.","Chu chu a hril zo chun, a kut le a nâk an kuomah ân entir a. Chun, Lalpa chu an hmu chun inchûktirhai chu an lâwm tah a."
21,"Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “In chungah thlamuongna um raw se, Pain kei a mi tir ang bawkin ka tir cheu hi,” a ti nâwk a."
22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril zoin, an chungah ân thuok a, an kuomah, “Thlarau Inthieng nei ro,"
23,"whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.","tu suol khawm in ngaidam taphawt chu ngaidam nîng a tih; tu suol khawm in ngaidam naw taphawt chu, ngaidam naw nîng a tih,” a ta."
24,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.","Chun, Isu a hung lai khan, sâwm le pahnihai laia ṭhang ve Thoma (Didum an ti bawk) chu an kuomah a um ve nawh a."
25,"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.","Chuongchun, inchûktir danghai chun a kuomah, “Lalpa chu kan hmu tah,” an ta. Nisienlakhawm, ama chun an kuomah, “A kuta thîr kilna serhai kha ka hmuh a, thîr kilna serhaia chun ka kut pârhai ka khîk lûta, a nâka ka pur meu naw chun, ring naw ning,” a ta."
26,"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.","Chun, ni riet hnungah, a inchûktirhai chu in sûngah an um nâwk a, Thoma khawm an kuomah a um veh a. Chun, Isu a hung a, kawthai chu khâr a ni sih a, anni lai a hung ngîr tah a, an kuomah, “In chungah thlamuongna um raw se,” a ta."
27,"Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.","Chun, Thoma kuoma chun, “I kut pârin hang them la, ka kuthai en rawh; i kut hang ban la, ka nak pur rawh; ring loin um naw la, ring el rawh,” a ta."
28,"Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.","Thoman a kuomah, “Ka Lalpa le ka Pathien i nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
29,"Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.","Isûn a kuomah, “Nangin kei i mi hmu leiin i ring a ni maw? Hmu loa ring taphawthai chu an hamṭha,” a ta."
30,"Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:","Chun, Isûn inchûktirhai hmaah inchikna dang tamtak a thaw ṭeu a, chuonghai chu hi lekhabua hin ziek a ni nawh."
31,"but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.","Nisienlakhawm, hieng hi, Isu chu, Krista, Pathien Naupa a nih ti in ringna ding le, in ring a, a hminga hringna in neina dinga ziek a nih."
