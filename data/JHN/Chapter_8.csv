1,but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.,Isu ruok chu Oliv tlângah a fe ta lem a.
2,"And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.","Chun, zingkâr inhmatakin Pathien biekinah a lût nâwk a, mi po po a kuomah an hung a; chun, ama chu a ṭhung a, anni ân chûktir a."
3,"And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,","Chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihaiin nuhmei pakhat a uiret leia an man an hung ṭhuoi a; a laiah an inngîrtir a."
4,"they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.","Isu kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, hi nuhmei hi a uiret lai an man a nih, a uiret lai takin."
5,Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?,Dân Lekhabuah Mosiein hieng ang mi hi lunga dêng hlum thu a mi pêk a; nangin iengtin am i ngai a?” an ta.
6,"And this they said, trying him, that they might have whereof to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.","Chu thu chu ama fiena dingin an thaw a nih, a hêkna ding an hmu theina dingin. Chuongchun, Isu a kûn a, a kutpârin hnuoiah a ziek a."
7,"But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.","Chun, an indawn sek sek leiin ama chu a tho a, an kuomah, “Nangni laia suol nei naw naw chun ama chu lungin dêng hmasa raw se,” a ta."
8,"And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.","Chun, a kûn nâwk a, a kutpârin hnuoi a ziek nâwk a."
9,"And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.","Chun, anni chun a thu hril chu an hrietin, a upatakin a phut a, a tâwp chenin, pakhat khatin an inrel hmang ta pei a; chuongchun, Isu chau a um tah a, nuhmei a laia a umna ngaia um le khan."
10,"And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?","Chun, Isu a tho a, a kuomah, “Nuhmei, khâwlai am an um tah a? Tukhawmin thiemnaw an inchangtir naw che a ni maw?” a ta."
11,"And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.]","Ama chun, “Lalpa, tukhawmin an mîn changtir nawh,” a ta. Chun, Isûn, “Kei khawmin thiemnaw kân changtir naw che; fe la, tuta hnung chu suksuol nâwk ta naw,” a ta.]"
12,"Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah thu a hril nâwk a, “Kei khawvêl êntu ka nih, tûkhawm a mi zui chu inthimah lêng tawp naw ni; hringna var nei lem a tih,” a ta."
13,"The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.","Chuongchun, Pharisaihaiin a kuomah, “Mâni thu inhriettir i nih, i thu inhriettir ân dik nawh,” an ta."
14,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.","Isûn an kuomah, “Mâni thu in- hriettir lang khawm ka thu inhriettir ân dik a nih; keiin ka hung suokna le ka fena ding chin khawm ka hriet a; nangni chun chu ka hung suokna le ka fena ding chin khawm in hriet si nawh."
15,Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.,Nangnîn tisa angin in sawisêl hlak; kei ruok chun tukhawm ka sawisêl nawh.
16,"Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.","Anih, sawisêl lang khawm ka sawisêlna chu indik a tih; keia khât chau ka ni nawh a, kei le Pa a mi tirtu leh kan ni lem leiin."
17,"Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.","Anih, in Dân Lekhabua khawm, ‘Mi pahni thu ân dik,’ ti ziek a ni bawk annâwm."
18,"I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.","Kei hi mâni thu inhriettirtu ka nih, Pa a mi tirtu chun ka thu ân hriettir bawk,” a ta, a dawn a."
19,"They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I pa khâwlai am?” an tih a. Isûn “Nangnîn kei in mi hriet nawh, ka Pa khawm in hriet nawh; kei mi hrie ni unla chu, ka Pa khawm hrieng in tih,” a ta."
20,"These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.","Chuong thu chu Pathien biekinah inchûktir malamin, thaw- lâwm siena hmunah a hril a; tukhawmin ama an man si nawh, a hun a la tlung naw leiin."
21,"He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Ka fe hmang ding a ni hi, nangnîn mi zawng in ta, in suol nei zingin thîng in tih; ka fena dingah hung thei naw ti niu,” a ti nâwk a."
22,"The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?","Chun, Judahaiin, “ ‘Ka fena dingah hung thei naw ti niu,’ a ti hi ân sukhlum ding am a nih?” an ta."
23,"And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni hnuoi tienga inthawka suok in nih, kei chu chung tienga suok ka nih; nangni hi khawvêla suok in nih, kei chu hi khawvêla suok ka ni nawh."
24,"I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.","Chuleiin, in kuomah, ‘In suol nei zingin thîng in tih,’ ka ti kha; ama chu ka nih ti in awi naw chun, in suol nei zingin thi mawl in tih,” a ta."
25,"They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Tû am i ni leh?” an tih a. Isûn an kuomah, “A tira inthawkin in kuomah ka hril hlak kha."
26,"I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.","Nangni chungchâng thua hin thil tamtak hril ding le ngaituo ding ka nei; ieng khawm ni raw se, a mi tirtu chu mi indiktak a nih; a kuoma inthawka thu ka hriet taphawt khawvêl kuomah ka hril hi,” a ta."
27,They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.,Pa thu an kuomah a hril ti an hriet nawh.
28,"Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.","Chuongchun, Isu bawkin, “Nangnîn Mihriem Naupa hi in khai kâng hnungin, ama chu ka ni le, kei mâni thuin thil iengkhawm ka thaw nawh a, Pain a mi hril ang peiin hieng thu hi ka hril a nih ti la hung hrieng in tih."
29,And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.,"A mi tirtu chu ka kuomah a um, a mi thlâthlam nawh; a thil lâwm zâwng taphawt ka thaw pei hlak leiin,” a ta."
30,"As he spake these things, many believed on him.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril laiin mi tamtakin ama chu an ring tah a."
31,"Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my disciples;","Chuongchun, Isûn a ringtu Judahai kuoma chun, “Ka thua in um zing chun, ka inchûktirhai ni taktak in tih;"
32,"and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.","chun, thutak hrieng in ta, thutak chun suok ni bân a ti cheu,” a ta."
33,"They answered unto him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?","Anni chun a kuomah, “Abraham thlahai kan nih ie, tu chen hin tu suoka khawm kan la um ngai nawh, ‘Suok ni bân a ti cheu,’ ieng ti tia i ti am a na?” an ta, an dawn a."
34,"Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.","Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm thil suksuol taphawt chu suol suok a nih."
35,And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.,Suok chu kumkhuoin inah a um zing nawh; naupa ruok chu kum- khuoin a um zing hlak.
36,"If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.","Chuongchun, Naupa hin suok ni a bân cheu chun, suok taktak in tih."
37,"I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.","Abraham thlahai in nih ti ka hriet deh; ni unla khawm mi that in tum si, ka thu hin in lungrilah umna a nei naw leiin."
38,I speak the things which I have seen with my Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father.,"Keiin ka Pa kuoma thil ka hmu chu ka hril hlak; nangni khawmin in pa kuoma thil in hriet chu in thaw hlak,” a ta."
39,"They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Kan pa Abraham a nih,” an tih a, an dawn a. Isûn an kuomah, “Abraham nauhai in ni chun, Abraham thil thaw naw ti niu am."
40,"But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin mi that in tum si. Pathien kuoma inthawka thutak ka ihriet hriltu cheu ka nih in sawnnaw; Abraham chun hieng hin a thaw naw kha."
41,"Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.","Nangni chun chu in pa thil chu in thaw hlak,” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Uire naua pieng kan ni nawh ie, Pa pakhat chau kan nei, Pathien chu,” an ta."
42,"Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.","Isûn an kuomah, “Pathien in Pa a ni chun nangnîn mi hmangai naw ti niu am; Pathien kuoma inthawka suok le a kuoma inthawka hung ka ni sih a; keima thua hung ka ni bawk nawh, ama chun a mi tir lem a nih."
43,Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word.,Iengdinga ka ṭawng umzie in hriet naw am a na? Ka thu hril in ngai phâk naw lei a nih.
44,"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.","Nangni chu in pa diebola inthawka suok in na, in pa dit zâwng thaw in nuom a nih. Ama chu a tîra inthawk tuolthattu a nih, thutakah a um nawh, a sûngah thutak hrim a um naw leiin. Khêl thu a hrilin ama suksuok a hril a ni hlak, khêlhlip a ni si; thukhêl pa khawm a nih."
45,"But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.",Thutak ka hril leiin nangnîn in mi ring naw a nih.
46,"Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?",Nangni lai tûin am suol kawngah thiemnaw mîn changtir a ta? Thutak ka hril khawmin nangnîn iengdinga in mi ring naw am a na?
47,"He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear them not, because ye are not of God.","Pathien kuoma inthawka suok chun Pathien thu a pawm hlak; hi lei hin in pawm naw a nih, Pathien kuoma inthawka suok in ni naw leiin,” a ta."
48,"The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?","Chun, Judahai chun a kuomah, “Samari mi khawhri zâwl i nih kan ti kha kan ti indik ngawt a ni naw am a nih?” an ta, an dawn a."
49,"Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.","Isûn, “Khawhri zâwl ka ni nawh ie, ka Pa ka chawimawi a ni lem; nangnîn ka hming in suksiet hi."
50,But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.,Mâni mawina zawng ka ni nawh; a zawngtu le a ngaituotu mi pakhat a um a nih.
51,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, miin ka thu a zâwm chun, kumkhuoin thi ni hmêl hmu naw ni,” a ta."
52,"The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.","Judahaiin a kuomah, “Khawhri zâwl i nih ti tuhin kan hriet tah. Abraham a thi tah, zâwlneihai leh, nangin, ‘Miin ka thu a zâwm chun, kumkhuoin thina intem naw nih,’ i ti sih a."
53,"Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?","Kan thlatu Abraham nêkin i ropui lem am a nih? Ama khawm a thi tah, zâwlneihai khawm an thi tah; tuin am însiem leh?” an ta."
54,"Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;","Chun, Isûn “Mâni inchawimawi lang, ka mawi ienga ding khawm a ni nawh: ‘Kan Pathien,’ in ti, ka Pa chu, a mi chawimawitu a nih;"
55,"and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.","nangnîn ama in hriet si nawh; kei ruok chun ama ka hriet; ‘Ama ka hriet nawh,’ ti lang nangni anga khêlhlip bawk nîng ka tih; chuong- chun, ama ka hriet a, a thu khawm ka zâwm hlak."
56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.","In thlatu Abraham kha ka ni hmu ding a ni leiin a hlim bêk bêk hlak; chun, a hmu ngei a, a lâwm hleh a,” a ta, a dawn a."
57,"The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?","Chun, Judahai chun a kuomah, “Nang kum sâwmnga khawm la tling lo el cheh a, Abraham i hmu am a nih?” an ta."
58,"Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.","Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Abraham um hma khawmin ka um,” a ta."
59,"They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.","Chuongchun, ama dêngna dingin lung an rût a; nisienlakhawm, Isu ân bi hmang a, Pathien biekina inthawk chu a suok tah a."
