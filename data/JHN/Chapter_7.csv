1,"And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judæa, because the Jews sought to kill him.","Chu zoa chun Isûn Galili ram a fang a, Judahaiin ama sukhlum an tum leiin Judai ram chu a fang nuom nawh a."
2,"Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.","Chun, Judahai Bâwktê Ruoiṭhe chu a hnai tah a."
3,"His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.","Chuongchun, a unauhaiin a kuomah, “Hitaka inthawkin Judai ramah va fe rawh, i închûktirhai khawmin i thilthaw hi an hmu theina dingin."
4,"For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.","Tûkhawmin mâni hming inthang nuom siin arûkin thil iengkhawm an thaw nawh. Hieng thilhai hi i thaw tak zet chun, khawvêl kâwlah inentir rawh,” an ta."
5,For even his brethren did not believe on him.,(A unauhai khawm chun ama an ring si nawh a).
6,"Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Ka hun a la tlung nawh; nangni hun ruok chu a tlung zing a nih."
7,"The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.","Khawvêlin nangni an theida thei naw cheu, kei ruok chu an mi theida hlak, an thilthawhai a suol ti ka hrilfie hlak leiin."
8,Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.,"Nangni ruoiṭhenaah hang fe ro, kei chu hi ruoiṭhea hin la fe hri naw ning, ka hun a la tlung naw leiin,” a ta."
9,"And having said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee.","Chun, chuong thu chu an kuomah a hril a, Galili ramah a la um zing a."
10,"But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.","Nisienlakhawm, a unauhai chu ruoiṭhenaa an hang fe hnung chun, ama khawm vântlâng ihriet loin, inrûkin a hang fe veh a."
11,"The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?","Chun, Judahaiin ruoiṭhenaa chun ama chu an zawng a, “Khâwlai am a um a?” an tih a."
12,"And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.","A chungah mipuihai laia mi an chier sup sup a, a ṭhenin, “Mi ṭha a nih ie,” an tih a; ṭhenkhatin, “Teu lo e, mipui a hlêm lem hlak a nih,” an ta."
13,Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.,"Nisienlakhawm, Judahai an ṭi leiin tûkhawmin a chungchâng thu an hril lang nawh."
14,"But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.","Chun, ruoiṭhe ṭhat lai takin, Isu Pathien biekinah a hang feh a, ân chûktir a."
15,"The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?","Chun, Judahaiin, “Hi mipa hin inchûk ngai loin iengtin am lekha a hriet a?” an ta, mak an ti hleh a."
16,"Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.","Chun, Isûn anni chu a dawn a, “Ka thu inchûktir hi ka ta a ni nawh a, a mi tirtu ta a ni lem."
17,"If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself.","Tûkhawm ama dit zâwng thaw nuom chun, thu inchûktir hi Pathien suksuok am a ni, keia phuokfâwma ka hril, hrieng a tih."
18,"He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.","Tûkhawm mâni phuokfâwm thu hril chu mâni mawina zawng a nih; a tirtu mawina zawng ruok chu, ama chu mi tak zet a nih, amaa chun indik nawna hrim a um nawh."
19,"Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?","Mosiein Dân chu a pêk naw cheu am a nih? Nisienlakhawm, nangni lai tukhawmin Dân chu in hraw si nawh. Nangnîn iengdinga mi sukhlum in tum am?” a ta."
20,"The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?","Chun, mipui chun, “Khawhri zâwl i ni hi, tuin am sukhlum a tum che leh?” an ta, an dawn a."
21,"Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.","Isu chun a dawn a, an kuomah, “Thil pakhat ka thaw kha nangni po poin mak in ti kha."
22,"Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.","Mosiein sertan thu kha a pêk cheu a, chu chu Mosie suksuok ni loin, thlâtuhai suksuok a ni lem. Chu lei chun a nih Châwlni khawma mi ser in tan hlak chu."
23,"If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?","Mosie Dân bawsiet nawna dingin Châwlnia khawm pasalin ser ân tantir si chun, keiin Châwlnia mi ka sukdam hieu leiin ka chungah in lunginsen bîk maw?"
24,"Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.","ân lang angin ngaituo naw unla, feltakin ngaituo lem ro,” a ta."
25,"Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?","Chun, Jerusalema mi ṭhen- khatin, “Hi mipa hi sukhlum an itum chu a ni naw am a nih?"
26,"And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?","En ta u, ân langin thu a hril a, a kuomah iengkhawm an hril si nawh. Ama hi Krista a ni ti hotuhaiin an hriet tak tak am a ni tah aw?"
27,"Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.","Hi mipa hi a piengna chenin ei hriet sih a, Krista ruok chu a tlung pha chun a piengna chin tukhawmin hre naw ni hai,” an ta."
28,"Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.","Chuong lei chun Isûn Pathien biekina ân chûktir malamin a khêk a, “Nangnîn in mi hriet, ka piengna chin khawm in hriet deh. Nisienlakhawm mâni thua hung ka ni nawh, a mi tirtu hi mi tak zet a nih, ama chu in hriet si nawh."
29,"I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.","Kei ruok chun ama chu ka hriet; a kuoma inthawka hung suok ka na, ama chun a mi tir a ni sih a,” a ta."
30,"They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.","Chuongchun, ama chu man an tum a, nisienlakhawm, a hun a la tlung naw leiin tukhawmin a chungah kut an thlâk si nawh."
31,"But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?","Mipui a ṭhen tamtak ruok chun ama chu an ring a, “Krista chu a hung tlung pha khawm, hi mipa thaw nêka tam thilmak a hung thaw ding am a nih?” an ta."
32,The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.,"Chun, Pharisaihaiin a chunga mipui chier rûknahai chu an hriet a, chuongchun, thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai chun ama man dingin manmihai an tir tah a."
33,"Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.","Chun, Isûn “Sâwt nawtê in kuomah la um hri phawt ka ta, chun a mi tirtu kuomah fêng ka tih."
34,"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.","Nangnîn mi zawng in ta, mi hmu si naw ti niu; ka umnaa khawm hung thei naw ti niu,” a ta."
35,"The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?","Chun, Judahai an inbiek a, “Ei hmu naw dingin hi mipa hi khâwlai am a fe ding a ni leh? Grikhai laia Inpêmdarhai laia fein Grikhai chu ân chûktir ding am nîng a ti?"
36,"What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?","‘Nangnîn mi zawng in ta, mi hmu si naw ti niu a; ka umnaa khawm hung thei naw ti niu,’ a ti hi, ieng a tina am a na?” an ta."
37,"Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.","Chun, ruoiṭhe ṭumṭiek ding ni, ni ropuitaka chun Isu a ngîr a, a khêk a, “Tûkhawm a dangchâr chun ka kuomah hung sienla, dâwn raw se."
38,"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.","Tûkhawm a mi ring chu Pathien Lekha hril angin, tui hring vadunghai a phînga inthawkin hung luong suok a tih,” a ta."
39,"But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.","(Chuong thu chu ama ring- tuhaiin Thlarau an nei dingzie thu a hrilna a nih; Thlarau chu pêk a la ni hri nawh, Isu chu chawimawia a la um hri naw leiin.)"
40,"Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.","Chuongchun, mipui laia ṭhen- khatin chuong thu chu an hrietin, “Hi mipa hi zâwlnei chu a ni ngei hi,” an ta."
41,"Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?","Ṭhenkhatin, “Hi hi Krista chu a nih,” an ta. Ṭhenkhatin, “Khâwlai am Krista chu Galili ramah hung suok hlak a ta?"
42,"Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?","Krista chu David thlahai laiah, David umna khuo Bethlehemah a suok ding a nih ti Pathien Lekhain a hril naw am a nih?” an ta."
43,So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.,"Chuongchun, ama leiin mipui chu an inṭheh a, an inkhing tah a."
44,And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.,"Ṭhenkhat chun man an nuom a, nisienlakhawm, tukhawmin a chung- ah kut an thlâk si nawh."
45,"The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?","Chun, manmihai chu thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai kuomah an hung nâwk a, chun, anni chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga in hung ṭhuoi naw?” an lo tih a."
46,"The officers answered, Never man so spake.","Manmihai chun, “Hi mipa thuhril ang hrim hin tukhawmin thu an hril ngai nawh,” an ta, an dawn a."
47,"The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?","Chun, Pharisaihai chun an kuomah, “Nangni khawm hlêmin in um ve tah a ni maw chu?"
48,"Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?",Hotuhai le Pharisaihai laia mi hrim hrim ama ring an um ta am a nih?
49,But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.,"Hieng dân hre naw mipuihai hrep hi ṭawngsephur an nih in sawnnaw,” an ta, an dawn a."
50,"Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),","Nikodem, inhmaa Isu kuoma hung kha, anni laia ṭhang ve a na, an kuomah,"
51,"Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?",“Ama bau ngeia a thu hriet le a thilthaw hriet hmain ei dânin mi thiemnaw ân changtir hlak am a nih?” a ta.
52,"They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Nang khawm chu Galili mi i ni ve am a nih? Zawng la, Galili rama chun zâwlnei tukhawm an suok ngai nawh ti hrieng i tih,” an ta, an dawn a."
53,[And they went every man unto his own house:,"[Chun, mi tin mâni in sengah an fe tah a."
