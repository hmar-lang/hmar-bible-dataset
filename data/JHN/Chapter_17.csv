verse_no,en,hmr
1,"These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee:","Chuong thu chu Isûn a hril a; chun vântieng nghain, “Pa, a hun a tlung tah; i Naupa chawimawi rawh, Naupa hin a chawimawina ding chein;"
2,"even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life.","khânga mi po po chunga thuneia i siem khan, a kuoma i pêkhai po chu chatuona hringna a pêk theina dingin."
3,"And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ.",Hi hi chatuona hringna a nih: nang Pathien tak chau le i tir Isu Krista hriet hi.
4,"I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.","Nangin thil thaw ding i mi pêk kha ka thaw zo tah a, khawvêla hin ka chawimawi ta che."
5,"And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.","Aw Pa, khawvêl um hmaa i kuoma mawina ka inei khan, tuhin nangma kuoma ngei mi chawimawi rawh."
6,"I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.","“Nangin khawvêla inthawka mî i mi pêkhai kuoma khan i hming ka suklang tah. Anni chu i ta an ni tah, nangin anni chu kei i mi pêk tah a, anni chun i thu an zâwm tah:"
7,Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:,"Nangin thil i mi pêk po po, i kuoma inthawka suok an nih ti tuhin an hriet tah."
8,"for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received them, and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.","Nangin thu i mi pêkhai kha an kuoma ka pêk ta sih a; chuong chu an vawn a, i kuoma inthawka suok ka nih ti indiktakin an hriet tah, nangin i mi tir ti khawm an awi tah."
9,"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:","“An ta dinga ka ngênpêk hi, khawvêl ta dinga ngênpêk ka ni nawh; nangin i mi pêkhai ta ding lemin a nih; i ta an ni si."
10,"and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.","Thil po po ka ta taphawt chu i ta a nih, i ta chu ka ta a nih; anni leiin chawimawiin ka um hlak."
11,"And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are.","Chun, kei chu khawvêlah um ta naw ning, hienghai hi chu khaw- vêlah um an tih, kei chu i kuomah ka hung ding a ni tah. Pa Inthieng, anni chu I hmingin hum rawh, I hming mi pêk khan, eini ang bawka pumkhat an ni theina dingin."
12,"While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.","“An kuomah ka um sûng khan, anni chu i hmingin ka hum hlak, i hming mi pêk khan, anni chu ka vêng a, anni lai pakhat khawm an bohmang nawh, bohmang naupa naw kha chu; Lekha thu kha a hung tlungna dingin."
13,"But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin i kuom- ah ka hung ding a ni tah; khawvêlah hieng thu hi ka hril a nih, ka lâwm annia an nei kimna dingin."
14,"I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.","I thu an kuomah ka pêk tah; chun, khawvêlin anni chu an theidah a, khawvêla mi an ni naw leiin, kei khawvêla mi ka ni naw ang bawkin."
15,"I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one.","“Nangin anni chu khawvêla inthawka i lâk suok dinga ngên ka ni nawh a, mi suola inthawk chun i hum ding a nih ka ti lem a nih."
16,"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.","Anni chu khawvêla mi an ni nawh, kei khawvêla mi ka ni naw ang bawk hin."
17,Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.,"Anni chu thutakin sukthieng rawh, i thu chu thutak a nih."
18,"As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.","Nangin khawvêla kei i mi tir ang khan, kei khawmin anni chu khawvêlah ka tir hi."
19,"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.","Anni leiin kân sukthieng a nih, anni khawm thutaka an inthieng theina dingin."
20,"Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;","“Hienghai ta ding chau hin ngên pêk ka ni nawh, an thu leia kei mi la hung ring dinghai ta ding khawma ngênpêk ka ni bawk ie, an rênga pumkhat an nina dingin;"
21,"that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.","Pa, nang keimaa i um le, kei nangmaa ka um ang bawk hin, anni khawm einia an umna dingin: nangin i mi tir ti khawvêlin an awi theina dingin."
22,"And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we are one;","Chun, nangin ropuina i mi pêk kha keiin an kuomah ka pêk tah; anni chu pumkhat an nina dingin, eini pumkhat ei ni ang bawk hin;"
23,"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.","kei anniah, nang keimaah, anni pumkhata an um a, an famkim theina dingin, nangin kei i mi tir ti le, i mi hmangai angin anni hi i hmangai ti, khawvêlin an hriet theina dingin."
24,"Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.","Pa, nangin kei i mi pêkhai hi ka umnaah ka kuoma um dingin ka dit; nangin i mi pêk ka ropuina kha an hmuna dingin; leihnuoi insieng hma khawmin nangin i mi hmangai ta sih a."
25,"O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;","Aw Pa feltak, khawvêl chun an hriet naw cheh a, kei ruok chun ka hriet che kha, hienghai khawm hin nangin kei i mi tir ti an hriet kha."
26,"and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.","Chun, an kuomah i hming kân hriettir a, inhriettir nâwk rawp ka tih; nangin kei i mi hmangaina kha anniah a um a, kei khawm annia ka um theina dingin,” a ta."
