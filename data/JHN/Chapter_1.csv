1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.","A tîrin thu a um, Thu chu Pathien kuomah a um, Thu chu Pathien a nih."
2,The same was in the beginning with God.,Chu chu a tîrin Pathien kuomah a um.
3,All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.,Iengkim a rêngin ama siem a nih; thil siem po po hi ama siem naw iengkhawm a um nawh.
4,In him was life; and the life was the light of men.,Amaa chun hringna a um; chu hringna chu mihriemhai var a nih.
5,And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.,"Var chu inthim lai a hung var a, inthimin chu chu a hriet nawh."
6,"There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.","Pathien tir mi pakhat a lo um a, a hming chu Johan a nih."
7,"The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.","Ama chu inhriettir dingin a hung a, var thu chu inhriettir dingin; ama leia mi po poin an awina dingin."
8,"He was not the light, but came that he might bear witness of the light.","Ama chu var chu a ni nawh, var thu chu inhriettir dinga hung a ni lem."
9,"There was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into the world.","Var indik tak mi tin sukvar hlak kha a um a, khawvêlah a hung zing a nih."
10,"He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.","Ama chu khawvêlah a um a, khawvêl ama siem a na, khawvêlin ama a hriet si nawh."
11,"He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.","Ama mihai kuomah a hung a, ama mihaiin an lo lâwm si nawh."
12,"But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name:","Nisienlakhawm, ama lâwm taphawt chu, an kuomah Pathien nauhai ni theina ding a pêk, a hming ringtuhai chu."
13,"who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.","Chuong mihai chu thisena nei an ni nawh a, tisa dit zâwnga nei an ni bawk nawh a, pasal dit zâwnga nei khawm an ni nawh a, Pathien inei an ni lem."
14,"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.","Chun, Thu chu tisain a hung inchang a, eini lai a hung um tah a, (Pa nau khât nei ropui angin a ropuizie ei hmuh), lunginsietna le thutakin a sip."
15,"John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.","Johan chun a thu ân hriettir a, a khêk a, “ ‘Ka hnunga hung ding chu ka nêka ropui lem a nih, ka um hmaa um ta hrim a ni leiin,’ tia a thu ka hril kha ama hi a nih,” a ta."
16,"For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.","A famkimna ei chang seng, lunginsietna chunga lunginsiet nâwksâwnna leh."
17,For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.,"Dân chu Mosie hmanga pêk a na, lunginsietna le thutak chu Isu Krista leiin a hung um."
18,"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.","Tukhawmin ienglai khawmin Pathien an hmu nawh; a Naupa khât nei sun, Pa ângsûnga um ngei khan a chanchin a hril tah a nih."
19,"And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?","Chun, Judahaiin, “Tû am i na?” tia indawn dingin Jerusalema inthawkin a kuomah thiempuhai le Levi chia mihai an tir lai khan, hieng hi Johan thu lo inhriettir chu a nih:"
20,"And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.",“Kei chu Krista chu ka ni nawh” tiin inphat loin ân phuong a.
21,"And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Tû am i ni leh? Elija i ni?” an ta, an indawn a. Ama chun, “Ka ni nawh,” a ta. “Zâwlnei kha i ni?” an ta, ama chun, “Ni lo e,” a ta, a dawn a."
22,"They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Anleh, tû am i na? a mi tirtuhai kan dawn theina dingin mi hril ta la. I chanchin hrim ieng am i hril ding a na?” an ta."
23,"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.","Ama chun, “ ‘Lalpa lampui suk- ruol ro,’ tia thlalêra khêktu râwl chu ka nih; zâwlnei Isai hril ang khan,” a ta."
24,And they had been sent from the Pharisees.,Mi tirhai chu Pharisaihai kuoma mi an nih.
25,"And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?","Anni chun a kuomah, “Krista bêk, Elija bêk, zâwlnei amani bêk i ni si naw chun, iengdinga i baptis hlak am a na?” an ta, an indawn a."
26,"John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,","Chun, Johan chun an kuomah, “Keiin tuiin ka baptis hlak, nangni lai in hriet naw mi pakhat a ngîr a nih,"
27,"even he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.","ama chu ka hnunga hung ding chu a na, a kekawk hrui sût tlâk khawm ka ni nawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
28,"These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",Chuong thil chu Jordan râla Bethania Johanin a baptisnaa kha thaw an nih.
29,"On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!","Chun, a zînga chun Johanin Isu a kuoma hung ding a hmuh a. Chun, a hril a, “En ta u, Pathien Berâmte khawvêl suol fepuitu ding saw!"
30,"This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.","Saw saw a nih, ‘mi pakhat ka nêka ropui lem, ka hnunga hung ding a um, ama chu ka um hmaa um ta hrim a nih,’ ka ti kha."
31,"And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.","Ama chu ka lo hriet si nawh; nisienlakhawm, Israelhai kuoma a hung inlangna dingin, tuia baptis-in ka hung a nih,” a ta."
32,"And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.","Chun, Johanin a thu ân hriettir a, a hril a, “Thlarau chu vaṭhu angin vâna inthawka ṭum ka hmuh a, a chungah a fu zing a."
33,"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.","Ama chu ka hriet si nawh a, nisienlakhawm, tuia baptis dinga a mi tirtu khan ka kuomah, ‘Tû chunga khawm Thlarau zu fua, a chunga um zing i hmu chun, ama chu Thlarau Inthienga baptistu ding chu nîng a tih,’ a tih a."
34,"And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.","Chu chu ka hmu tah a, ama hi Pathien Naupa a nih ti kân hriettir tah,” a ta."
35,"Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;","Chun, a zîng nâwk chun Johan a ngîr a, a închûktirhai pahni leh;"
36,"and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!","chun, Isu invâk vêl lai chu an en a, “En ta u, Pathien Berâmte saw,” a ta."
37,"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.","Chun, a închûktirhai pahni chun a thu hril chu an hriet a, Isu an zui tah a."
38,"And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abidest thou?","Chun, Isu a nghah a, an hung zui chu a hmuh a, an kuomah, “Ieng am in zawng a?” a ta. Anni chun, “Rabbi, (chu chu inchûktirtu tina a nih), khâwlai am i um a?” an ta."
39,"He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hung unla, hmûng in tih,” a ta. Chuong- chun, an feh a, a umna chu an hmuh a, chu ni chun a kuomah an um zing a; zânbu suong pha vêl a nih."
40,"One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.","Johan thu hril hrea Isu zuihai pahni chu, a pakhat lem chu Andri, Simon Peter unau a nih."
41,"He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).","Ama chun a hmasatakin ama unau Simon a hmuh a, a kuomah “Messie kan hmu tah,” a ta, (chu chu Krista tina a nih.)"
42,"He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).","Chuongchun, Isu kuomah a hung ṭhuoi a, Isûn ama chu a lo en a, “Johan naupa Simon i nih, Kipha tîng an ti che,” a ta, (chu chu Peter tina a nih.)"
43,"On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.","Chun, a zînga chun Isu Galili ramah fe a tum a, Philip a hmuh a, “Mi zui rawh,” a ta."
44,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.","Philip chu Bethsaida khuoa mi a nih, chu chu Andri le Peter umna khuo bawk a nih."
45,"Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.","Philip chun Nathanael a hmuh a, a kuomah, “A chanchin Mosiein Dân lekhabua a ziek le, zâwlneihaiin an ziek kha, ama chu kan hmu tah, Nazareth Isu, Josef naupa chu,” a ta."
46,"And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.","Chun, Nathanael chun a kuomah, “Nazareth khuoah thil ṭha a suok thei am a nih?” a ta. Philip chun a kuomah, “Hung la, en rawh,” a ta."
47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!","Isûn Nathanael a kuoma hung ding chu a hmuh a, a chanchin a lo hril a, “En ta u, Israel mi tak, rîtlona hrim hrim nei lo saw,” a ta."
48,"Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.","Nathanael chun a kuomah, “Nangin iengtin am i mi hriet a?” a ta. Isûn a kuomah, “Philipin a ko hma cheh a, theichang bula i um lai khan ka hmu che annâwm,” a ta, a dawn a."
49,"Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.","Nathanaelin a kuomah, “Rabbi, Pathien Naupa i nih, Israelhai Laltak i nih,” tiin a dawn a."
50,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.","Isûn a kuomah, “ ‘Theichang bulah ka hmu che,’ i kuoma ka ti leiin i ring a ni maw? Hieng nêka thil ropui lem la hmûng i tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
51,"And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.","Chun, Isu bawkin a kuomah, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, vân inhawngah, Pathien vântir- kohai Mihriem Naupa chunga hin a lâwn le a ṭum la hmûng in tih,” a ta."
