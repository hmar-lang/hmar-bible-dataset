1,"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be caused to stumble.",“Sukthlûka in um nawna dingin hieng thu hi in kuomah ka hril ta hi.
2,"They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God.","Inkhâwmna inahai inhnawngtir an ti cheu a, anih, tûkhawm a sukhlum dinghai po cheuin Pathien chungah thilṭha thawin inhrieng an tih, chuong ang hun chu a tlung ding a nih."
3,"And these things will they do, because they have not known the Father, nor me.","Chuong thil chu thâwng an tih, Pa le kei an mi hriet naw leiin."
4,"But these things have I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.","Hieng thu hi in kuomah ka hril ta hi, a hun chu a hung tlung pha, ka hril ta cheu ti in hriet nâwkna dingin. Hieng thil hi a tîra inthawk ka la hril naw hrim cheu a nih, in kuoma ka la um leiin."
5,"But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?","Tu ruok hin chu a mi tirtu kuomah ka fe ding a nih, nangni rawi tukhawmin, ‘Khâwlai am i fe ding?’ tiin in mîn dawn si nawh."
6,"But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.",Hieng thu hi in kuomah ka hril leiin in lungril chu lungngaiin a sip ṭeu lem tah a.
7,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.","“Nisienlakhawm, thu indiktak ka hril cheu hi, ka fe in ta dingin a ṭha; ka fe naw chun Thlamuongtu chu in kuomah a hung naw ding a ni sih a; kei ka fe ruok chun in kuomah hung tir ka tih."
8,"And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:","Ama chu a hung tlung chun suol thua dâm, fel thua dâm, rorêl thua dâm khawvêl an thiemnaw inhriettir a tih;"
9,"of sin, because they believe not on me;","suol thua dâm thiemnaw chang an tih, kei an mi ring naw leiin,"
10,"of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more;","fel thua dâm thiemnaw chang an tih, Pa kuomah ka fe ding a na, nangnîn in mi hmu nâwk ta naw ding lei hin;"
11,"of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.","rorêl thua dâm thiemnaw chang an tih, hi khawvêl lal hi inthiemloa a tlûk ta leiin."
12,"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.","“In kuomah thu hril ding tamtak ka la nei ta rawp a; nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu tlin hri naw ti niu."
13,"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.","Nisienlakhawm, ama Thlarau indiktak chu a hung tlung pha chun, thutak po poa chun ṭhuoi lût a ti cheu a, ama phuok fâwmin thu a hril âwm si nawh a, thu a idawng taphawt chu hril lem a tih; thil hung tlung dinghai khawm inhriettir a ti cheu."
14,"He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare it unto you.","Ama chun kei mi chawimawi a tih, ka taa mi lâng a ta, in kuomah ân hriettir ding cheu a ni sih a."
15,"All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare it unto you.","Pain thil a nei po po ka ta a nih; chuleiin, ‘ka taa mi lâng a ta, in kuomah inhriettir a ti cheu,’ ka ti hi."
16,"A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.","“Sâwt nawtêah nangnîn kei mi hmu naw ti niu a, sâwt nawtêa bawk nangnîn kei mi hmu nâwk in tih,” a ta."
17,"Some of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?","Chun, a închûktirhai ṭhenkhat- in, “Ei kuoma a thu hril hi ieng am a na? ‘Sâwt nawtêah nangnîn kei mi hmu naw ti niu a, sâwt nawtêa bawk nangnîn kei mi hmu nâwk in tih,’ a ti le, ‘Pa kuoma ka fe ding leiin,’ a ti hi,” an in tih a."
18,"They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.","Chun, anni ma chun, “Hi hi ieng am a na? ‘Sâwt nawtê,’ a ti hi. A thu hril hi a ngaina ei hriet nawh,” an ta."
19,"Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?","Chun, ama indawn an nuom ti Isûn a hriet a, an kuomah, “ ‘Sâwt nawtêah nangnîn kei mi hmu naw ti niu, sâwt nawtêa bawk nangnîn kei mi hmu nâwk in tih,’ tia hi ka thu hril hi in indawn maw?"
20,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.","Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, nangni in mitthli tlâng a ta, ṭap rak bawk in ta, khawvêl ruok chu lâwm an tih, nangni lungngai in ta, nisienlakhawm, in lungngai chu lâwmin inchang a tih."
21,"A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.","Nuhmeiin nauha ân vawiin a lungngai hlak, a hun a tlung ta leiin, nisienlakhawm, nau a hung nei phing chun a thlaphâng chu a hriet nâwk ta ngai nawh, khawvêla mihriem hung pieng chu a lâwm leiin."
22,"And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.","Chun, tuhin nangni in lung- ngai, nisienlakhawm, hmu nâwk ka ti cheu a, in lungril lâwm a tih, in lâwm chu tukhawmin lâkpêk naw ni hai cheu."
23,"And in that day ye shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name.","Chu ni chun nangnîn kei iengkhawm mîn dawn naw ti niu. Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Pa kuomah in hni taphawt chu ka hmingin pêng a ti cheu."
24,"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.","Tu chen hin keia hmingin iengkhawm in la hni nawh; hni ro, chuongchun hmûng in tih, in lâwm a kimna dingin."
25,"These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.","“Chuong thu chu a thawiin in kuomah ka hril tah; a hun a tlung ding a nih, chu pha chun a thawiin in kuomah thu hril nâwk ta naw ning a, fietakin Pa chanchin hril lem ka ti cheu."
26,"In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;","Chu ni chun keia hmingin thil hnîng in ta, chun, ‘Pa kuomah keiin ngên pêk ka ti cheu,’ ka ti naw cheu a,"
27,"for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.","Pa ngeiin a hmangai si cheu a, nangnîn kei in mi hmangai a, Pathiena suok ka nih ti in ring leiin."
28,"I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.","Kei Pa kuoma inthawka hung suok a, khawvêla hung ka nih; khawvêl fe san a, Pa kuoma fe nâwk ding ka nih,” a ta."
29,"His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.","A închûktirhaiin, “Ngai ta, tuhin chu fietakin thu i hril a, a thawi hrim hrimin i hril ta naw hi."
30,"Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.","Nangin iengkim i hriet a, tukhawm indawn che i ngai nawh ti tuhin kan hriet tah; hi hi lei hin Pathien kuoma hung suok i ni ti kan awi ie,” an ta."
31,"Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?","Chun, Isûn a dawn a, an kuomah, “Tuhin chu in awi ta maw?"
32,"Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.","Ngai ro, a hun a tlung ding a ni tah, anih, a tlung zing tah, chu pha chun, mâni in sengah indar vawng in tih, keia khât chauin mi thlâthlam in tih; nisienlakhawm, Pa ka kuoma a um leiin makhât chauin ka um si nawh."
33,"These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.","Hieng thu hi in kuomah ka hril ta hi, keimaa in thlamuongna dingin. Khawvêla hin rinumin in um hlak; nisienlakhawm, thlamuong- takin um ro, keiin khawvêl ka hne tah,” a ta."
