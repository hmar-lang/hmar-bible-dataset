1,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.","“Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tûkhawm berâm huona kawtkhâra lût loa, a dang tienga lâwn lût chu ama chu iengkhat inruhmang le suomhmang a nih."
2,But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.,"Tûkhawm kawtkhâra lût ruok chu, berâm vêngtu a nih."
3,"To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.","Kawtkhâr vêngtuin ama chu a lo hawng pêk hlak a; berâmhaiin a râwl an hriet hlak a; ama berâmhai chu an hmingin a ko seng a, a ṭhuoi suok hlak a."
4,"When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.","A ta po po ân suoktir phingleh, an hma a ṭhuoi a, berâmhaiin ama an zu i hlak a, a râwl an hriet sih a."
5,"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.","Mi dang chu zui naw ni hai a, tlân hmang san lem an tih; mi danghai râwl chu an hriet naw leiin,” a ta."
6,This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.,"Chu tekhithu chu Isûn an kuomah a hril a; nisienlakhawm, ieng thu am a na an kuomah a hril an hriet si nawh a."
7,"Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.","Chuongchun, Isûn an kuomah a hril nâwk a, “Titakzetin, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, kei hi berâm kawtkhâr chu ka nih,"
8,All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.,"ka hmaa hunghai po po kha inruhmanghai, suomhmanghai an ni vawng a; nisienlakhawm, berâmhai chun an thu an awi nawh."
9,"I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.","Kei kawtkhâr chu ka nih; tûkhawm keimaah a lût chun, humhimin um a ta, lûtin suok a ta, fâk ding hmu bawk a tih."
10,"The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.","Inruhmang chu, inru ding le, sukhlum ding le sukse ding naw chun a hung nawh; kei chu hringna an neina dingin, tamtaka an neina dinga hung ka nih."
11,I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.,Kei bêram vêngtu ṭha chu ka nih; berâm vêngtu ṭha chun berâmhai ta dingin a hringna a pêk hlak.
12,"He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth them:","Inhlawfa, berâm vêngtu tak ni loa, berâmhai a ta ni lo chun satene hung a hmu chun berâmhai a tlânsan hlak; chun, satene chun berâmhai a seh a, a sukdar hlak;"
13,"he fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.","inhlawfa a na, berâmhai a ngai- sak naw leiin a tlânsan hlak a nih."
14,"I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,","Kei chu berâm vêngtu ṭha ka nih; ka ta chu ka hriet a, ka ta khawmin an mi hriet a nih,"
15,"even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.","Pain a mi hriet a, kei khawmin Pa ka hriet ang hin; chun, berâmhai ta ding chun ka hringna ka pêk."
16,"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.","Chun, hi berâm huona mi naw khawm hi, berâm dang ka nei; anni khawm ka la hung ṭhuoi ding a nih, ka râwl khawm hrieng an tih, chuongchun, pâwl khatin um an ta, a vêngtu pakhat leh."
17,"Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.","“Hi lei hin Pain a mi hmangai a nih, lâk nâwk dinga ka hringna ka pêk ding leiin."
18,"No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.","Tûkhawmin mi lâkpêk naw ni hai, keima thu thuin ka pêk lem ding a nih; pe thei ka nih, la nâwk thei khawm ka nih. Hi thupêk hi ka Pa kuoma inthawka ka hmu a nih,” a ta."
19,There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.,"Chuong thu lei chun Judahai an inṭheh a, an inkhing nâwk a."
20,"And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?","A ṭhen tamtakin, “Khawhri a zâwl a, ân vêt a ni hi; iengdinga a thu in ngai am a na?” an ta."
21,"Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?","A ṭhenin, “Hieng thu hi khawhri zâwl thuhril a ni nawh ie. Khawhri chun mitdel mit a sukvar thei am a nih?” an ta."
22,And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:,"Chun, Jerusalema Inpumpêk Ruoiṭhe lai a na; chu chu thlasik lai a nih."
23,it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.,"Chun, Isu Pathien biekinah, Solomon tuolpûka chun ân lawn ân lawn a."
24,"The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.","Chun, Judahai a kâwlah an hung a, a kuomah, “Ieng chen am lungâwpinkaiin i mi sie ding a na? Krista i ni chun feltakin mi hril rawh,” an ta."
25,"Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.","Isûn an kuomah, “Ka hril ta cheu kha in awi si nawh; ka Pa hminga thil ka thaw hi, hieng hin ka chanchin ân hriettir a ni hi."
26,"But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.","Nisienlakhawm, in awi si nawh, ka berâm laia mi in ni naw leiin."
27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:","Ka berâmhaiin ka râwl an hriet hlak, kei khawmin anni chu ka hriet, anni chun an mi zui hlak."
28,"and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.","An kuomah chatuona hringna ka pêk hlak; kumkhuoin bohmang naw ni hai a, tukhawmin ka kuta inthawkin mi lâkpêk bawk naw ni hai."
29,"My Father, who hath given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.","Anni mi petu ka Pa chu mi po po nêka ropui a nih, tukhawmin Pa kuta inthawk chu lâkpêk thei naw ni hai."
30,I and the Father are one.,"Kei le Pa chu pumkhat kan nih,” tiin a dawn a."
31,The Jews took up stones again to stone him.,"Chun, Judahai chun a dêngna dingin lung an rût nâwk a."
32,"Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?","Chun, Isûn anni chu a biek a, “Pa kuoma inthawka suok sinthaw ṭha tamtak kân entir cheu a, khâng sinthawhai laia ieng sinthaw lei khan am a ni lunga in mi dêng ding hi?” a ta."
33,"The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.","Judahai chun a kuomah, “Sin ṭha chunga lunga dêng ding che kan ni nawh a; Pathien i hrilsietna chunga le, nang mihriem ni sih a, Pathiena în siem lei hin a ni lem a nih,” tiin an dawn a."
34,"Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?","Isûn an kuomah, “In Dân lekhabuah, ‘Pathienhai in nih ka tih,’ ti ziek a ni naw am a nih?"
35,"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),","Pathien thu tlungnahai hman pathienhai an ti chun, (Pathien Lekha thu bân thei a ni si nawh a)"
36,"say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?","Pain a iruot, khawvêla a itir chunga hin, ‘Pathien Naupa ka nih,’ ka ti leiin, ‘Pathien i hrilsiet,’ in ti a ni maw?"
37,"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.",Ka pa sinthaw ka ni naw chun mi ring naw ro.
38,"But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.","Amiruokchu, thaw ka ni chun, kei mi ring naw unla khawm, sin- thawhai bêk hi ring ro; Pa keimaah a um ti le, kei Paah ka um ti in hriet a, in ringna dingin,” a ta, a dawn a."
39,They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.,"Chuongchun, ama chu man an tum nâwk a, nisienlakhawm, an kuta inthawkin a suok a."
40,And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode.,"Jordan vadung râlah, Johanin a tîra mi a baptisna hmun tieng khan a fe hmang nâwk tah a, chutaka chun a um ta zing a."
41,"And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.","Chun, mi tamtak a kuomah an hung a, “Johanin thilmak iengkhawm chu a thaw nawh a; nisienlakhawm, Johanin hi mipa chungchâng thu a hril taphawt kha chu ân dik hle hi,” an ta."
42,And many believed on him there.,"Chun, chutaka chun mi tam- takin ama an ring tah a."
