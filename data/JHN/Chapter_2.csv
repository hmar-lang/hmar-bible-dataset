1,And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:,"Chun, ni thum niah, Galili rama Kana khuoah inneina ruoiṭhe a um a, chutaka chun Isu nu a um a."
2,"and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.",Isu le a închûktirhai khawm inneinaa chun an fiel a.
3,"And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.","Chun, uoinin a dai ta nawh a, Isu nu chun a kuomah, “Uoin an tlasam tah ie,” a ta."
4,"And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.","Isu chun a kuomah, “Nuhmei, nanga mi lo hrietpêk ding ieng am a um a? ka hun a la tlung nawh,” a ta."
5,"His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.","Chun, a nu chun rawngbâwltu- hai kuomah, “In kuoma a hril taphawt chu thaw pei ro,” a ta."
6,"Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews’ manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.","Chun, Judahai inthien dân angin lung tuibêl paruk, bûk sâwmli hmun hni amanih, hmun thum amanih keng seng chutaka chun an intung a."
7,"Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Tuibêl- ahai tui suksip ro,” a ta. A rei inruolin an suksip seng a."
8,"And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.","Chun, an kuomah, “Tuhin thâl unla, ruoiṭhe hotu kuomah fepui ro,” a ta. Chun, an fepui tah a."
9,"And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,","Chun, ruoiṭhe hotu chun tui uoina hung inchang chu ân tem a, a suokna chin a hriet nawh a, (tui thâl rawngbâwltuhai ruok chun an hriet a), nuhmei nei tupa chu a ko tah a,"
10,"and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when men have drunk freely, then that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.","a kuomah, “Mi tinin a tirin uoin ṭha an sie suok hlak, chun, a tam deu an dâwn hnungin a ṭha naw deu chu an sie suok hlak, nang ruok chun tu chen hin uoin ṭha i la nei zing a,” a ta."
11,"This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.","Isûn hi a thilmak thaw phutna hi Galili ram Kana khuoa chun a thaw a nih, a ropuizie ân langtir a; chun, a inchûktirhai chun ama chu an ring tah a."
12,"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.","Chun, chu hnunga chun, Kaper- naumah a zu fe a, ama le a nu leh, a unauhai le, a închûktirhai leh; chutaka chun ni sâwt nawtê an um a."
13,"And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","Chun, Judahai Fekân Ruoiṭhe a hnai tah a, Isu Jerusalemah a hang feh a."
14,"And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:","Chun, Pathien biekina se- bâwnghai, berâmhai, vaṭhuhai zawr- tuhai le tangka thlengtuhai ṭhung a hmuh a."
15,"and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables;","Chun, hruihruol invuokna a siem a, sebâwng le berâm an rêngin Pathien biekina inthawk chun a hnawt dawk a, tangka thlengtuhai tangka chu a bunthlâk a, an dawkânhai a nam thlûkpêk bawk a;"
16,"and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.","chun, vaṭhu zawrtuhai kuoma chun, “Hieng thilhai hi hitaka inthawkin fepui ro, ka Pa in sum- dâwngna inin siem naw ro,” a ta."
17,"His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.","Chun, a inchûktirhai chun, “I ina ka ṭhahnemngainân mi fa zo a tih” ti ziek a nih ti an hriet nâwk tah a."
18,"The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?","Chun, Judahaiin a kuomah, “Hieng thil i thaw hi inchikna ieng am i mîn hmutir thei a?” tiin ama an in dawn a."
19,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.","Isûn an kuomah, “Hi in hi sukseb unla, ni thum sûngin inngîr nâwk ka tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
20,"The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?","Chun, Judahai chun, “Hi in hi kum sâwmli paruk sûng bâwl a nih, nangin ni thum sûngin inngîr i ti maw?” an ta."
21,But he spake of the temple of his body.,"(Nisienlakhawm, a taksa in chu hril a lo ni lem sih a."
22,"When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.","Chuleiin, mithi laia inthawka a thonâwkin, chu thu chu a hril tah ti a închûktirhai chun an hriet nâwk tah a; chun, Pathien Lekha Thu le Isu thu hril chu an ring tah a)."
23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.","Chun, Fekân Ruoiṭhea Jerusa- lema a um lai chun, a thilmak thawhai an hmuh a, mi tamtakin a hming an ring tah a."
24,"But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,","Nisienlakhawm, Isu chu anni lai a ngam nawh, mi po po a hriet a."
25,and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.,"Mihriem thu tukhawm ihril a ngai nawh, ama chun mihriem sûnga um taphawt chu a hriet sih a."
