1,"And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.","Chun, Isûn a fe malamin a pieng tîra inthawka mitdel pakhat a hmuh a."
2,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?","Chun, a închûktirhaiin a kuomah, “Rabbi, mitdel saa a pieng hi tuin am thil a suksuol, ama hin am, a nu le a pain?” an ta, an indawn a."
3,"Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.","Isûn, “Hi mipa hin a suksuol nawh, a nu le a pain an suksuol bawk nawh, Pathien sinthaw a chunga ân langna dingin a ni lem."
4,"We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.","Sûn a ni laiin a mi tirtu sin ei thaw ding a nih, zân a ni ding a ni ta hi, chu pha chun tukhawmin thaw thei naw ni hai."
5,"When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.","Khawvêla ka um sûngin khawvêl êntu ka nih,” a ta, a dawn a."
6,"When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,","Chuong anga a hril zo chun, hnuoiah chil a sâk a, chil chun pil- pawk a siema, pilpawk chu a mitah a nâl a,"
7,"and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.","chun, a kuomah, “Siloam dîlah va sâwp rawh,” a ta. (Siloam chu, “Tir,” tina a nih.) Chun, a va feh a, a sâwp a, mit varin a hung tah a."
8,"The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?","Chuongchun, a vênghai le inhmaa a kutdaw hmu hlakhai chun, “Hi mipa hi ṭhung puma kut daw hlak kha a ni naw am a nih?” an ta."
9,"Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.","Ṭhenkhatin, “Ama kha a ni hi,” an ta. Mi dangin, “A ni nawh ie, ân angpui a ni lem hi,” an ta. Ama chun, “Kha kha ka nih,” a ta."
10,"They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I mit iengtin am a hung var leh?” an ta."
11,"He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.","Ama chun, “Isu an ti khan pilpawk a siem a, ka mitah a nâl a, ‘Siloam dîlah va sâwp rawh,’ a mi tih a. Chuongchun, ka va feh a, ka sâwp a, mitvarna ka hmu tah a ni hi,” a ta."
12,"And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Ama chu khâwlai am a um a?” an ta. Ama chun, “Ka hriet nawh,” a ta."
13,They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.,"Chun, chu hmaa mit indel chu Pharisaihai kuomah an ṭhuoi a."
14,"Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.","Chun, Isûn pilpawk a siem a, a mit a sukvar ni kha châwlni a na."
15,"Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.","Chuongchun, Pharisaihaiin mitvarna a hmu dân an indawn nâwk a. Ama chun an kuomah, “Ka mitah pilpawk a sieh a, ka sâwp a, ka hmu thei el a nih,” a ta."
16,"Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.","Chun, Pharisai ṭhenkhatin, “Chu mipa chu châwlni a hlutsak naw leiin Pathien kuoma inthawka suok ni naw ni,” an ta. Ṭhenkhat ruok chun, “Mi suolin iengtin am hieng ang thilmak thaw thei a ta?” an ta. An inṭheh a, an inkhing tah a."
17,"They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.","Chun, mitdel kuoma chun, “I mit a sukvar kha nang ieng angin am i ngai a?” an ti nâwk a. Ama chun, “Zâwlnei a nih,” a ta."
18,"The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,","Nisienlakhawm, Judahaiin mit- varna hmutu nu le pa chu an ko hmakhat chu mitdel a na, mitvarna a hmu ti, a chungchâng thu chu an awi nawh a."
19,"and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?","Chun, a nu le pa kuoma chun, “Hi mipa hi in naupa, mitdel saa pieng a nih in ti kha a ni am a nih? Iengtin am tuhin a hmu thei ta a?” tiin an indawn a."
20,"His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:","A nu le pa chun, “Hi mipa hi kan naupa a nih ti kan hriet, mitdel sain a pieng ti khawm kan hriet,"
21,"but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.","nisienlakhawm, iengtin am tuhin a hung hmu thei tah a na kan hriet nawh, a mit sukvartu khawm kan hriet bawk nawh; ama indawn ro; patling a nih annâwm, ama thu chu ama bawkin hril raw se,” an ta, an dawn a."
22,"These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.","Judahai an ṭi leiin a nu le pa chun chuong thu chu an hril a nih; Judahaiin, chu hma khawm chun tûkhawmin “Ama chu Krista a nih,” tia an ṭan chun, inkhâwmna inah hnawng an tih ti hi an remti sa a na."
23,"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.","Chuleichun a nih, a nu le pa chun, “Patling a nih annâwm, ama indawn ro,” an ti chu."
24,"So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.","Chuongchun, mitdel chu an ko nâwk a, a kuomah, “Pathien inpâk rawh, ama kha chu mi suol a nih ti kan hriet,” an ta."
25,"He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.","Ama chun, “Mi suol a ni le ni naw ka hriet nawh, kawng khat ka hriet, kha hma khan ka mit ân del a, tuhin ka hmu thei ta hi,” a ta, a dawn a."
26,"They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I chungah iengtin am a thawh a? I mit iengtin am a sukvar a?” an ta."
27,"He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Nakie khan ka hril ta cheu kha, in hriet nuom si nawh; iengdinga in hriet nuom nâwk ta am a ni leh? Nangni khawm ama inchûktirhai ni in nuom ve am a nih?” tiin a dawn a."
28,"And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.","Chun, anni chun an hal a, “Nang hi ama inchûktir i na, keini chu Mosie inchûktirhai kan ni hi teh."
29,"We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.","Pathienin Mosie a biek ti kan hriet, hi mipa hrep hi khâwlaia inthawka hung suok am a na, kan hriet hrep nawh,” an ta."
30,"The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Chu chu a nih a makna chu, khâwlaia inthawka hung suok am a ni in hriet nawh a, ka mit a sukvar tlat si hi."
31,"We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.","Pathienin mi suol thu a ngai ngai nawh ti ei hriet; nisienlakhawm, tukhawmin Pathien a ngaisak a, a dit zâwng a thaw chun, Pathienin ama chu a thu a ngai hlak."
32,Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.,Khawvêl insieng tira inthawk tukhawmin mitdel saa pieng mit an sukvar nâwk ti an hriet ngai nawh.
33,"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.","Hi mipa hi Pathien kuoma inthawka suok a ni naw chun, iengkhawm thaw thei naw ni,” a ta, a dawn a."
34,"They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Nang suol letdêra pieng i nih annâwm, nangin i mi hril vei maw?” an ta, an dawn a. Chuongchun, ama chu an hnawt dawk tah a."
35,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?","Chun, an hnawt dawk ti Isûn a lo hriet a; chun, a zawng dawk a, “Pathien Naupa i ring am?” a ta."
36,"He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?","Ama chun, “Pu, ama chu tu am a na, mi hril rawh, ka ring theina dingin?” a ta, a dawn a."
37,"Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.","Isûn a kuomah, “Ama chu i hmu zing tah, a be zingtu che hi a nih,” a ta."
38,"And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.","Ama chun, “Lalpa, ka ring ie,” a ta, chibai a bûk a."
39,"And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.","Chun, Isûn, “Rorêl dinga hi khawvêla hin hung ka nih, mitdelhai chu an mit a hung varna ding le, mitvarhai chu an mit a hung indelna dingin,” a ta."
40,"Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?","Chun, a kâwla Pharisai umhai chun chuong thu chu an hriet a, a kuomah, “Keini khawm hi mitdel kan ni ve am a nih?” an ta."
41,"Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.","Isûn an kuomah, “Mitdel in ni chun suol nei naw ti niu a, nisienlakhawm, ‘Kan hmu thei ie,’ tuhin in ti sih a, chuleiin, in suol a um zing a nih."
