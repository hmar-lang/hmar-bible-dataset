1,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.","Naomi chun a pasal laibung, Elimelek pahnama mi neinung- tak laibung a nei a, a hming chu Boaz a nih."
2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.","Chun, Moab mi Ruth chun Naomi kuomah, “Lo tieng va fêng ka ta, a mi lo lunginsiet taphawt hai buhnung va zawng ka tih aw,” a tih a. Ama chun a kuomah, “Fe raw chu, ka naunu,” a tih a."
3,"And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.","Chuongchun, a fe tah a, busîk- tuhai lâk ṭhel chu a va zawng a: Elimelek pahnam, Boaz lo kherah a va fe fûk hlau el a."
4,"And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee.","Chun, ngai ta, Bethlehema in- thawkin Boaz chu a hung a, busîktuhai kuoma chun, “In kuomah LALPA um raw se,” a tih a. Anni chun, “LALPAIN malsâwm raw se che,” tiin an dawn a."
5,"Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?","Chun, Boaz chun a siehlaw, bu- sîktuhai chunga hotu kuoma chun, “Hi hi tu nunghâk am a ni leh?” a tih a."
6,"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:","Busîktuhai chunga hotu chun, “Moab nunghâk, Moab rama in- thawka Naomi le hung kîr a nih."
7,"and she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.","‘Mi lunginsiet la, in bu lâk ṭhel zawng ka tih, busîktuhaiin an buphalhai an inkhâwm zona hnung peiah zawng ka tih,’ a tih a; chuongchun, a hung a, ṭuah sâwt nawte a châwl ti naw chu, zîngkâra inthawkin a la zawng ta zing a nih,” tiin a dawn a."
8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.","Chun, Boaz chun Ruth kuomah, “Ka naunu, lo ngai ta, lo danga chu buhnung zawngin fe naw la, hitaka inthawk hi fe sawn naw rawh, ka siehlaw nunghâkhai kuoma hin um zing rawh."
9,"Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.","An busîk hi en zing la, an hnung hi zui pei rawh, tlangvâlhai chu iengkhawm law lo ding chein thu ka pêk diem tah; chun, i dang a châr po leh tuibêla tlangvâlhai tui chawisa va dâwn hlak la,” a tih a."
10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found favor in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?","Chun, ama chu a kûn a, hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a, a kuomah, “Hnam dang ka ni sih a, hienga i mi lo hriet nuoma i mi lo lunginsiet hi iengtizie am a ni leh?” a tih a."
11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.","Boaz chun a dawn a, “I pasal thiha inthawka i tarpinu chunga i thilthawhai po po miin an mi hril vawng a; chun i pa le nu le i pieng- na ram mâksana mi i la hriet ngailohai kuoma i hung dânhai chen hin."
12,"Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.","LALPA chun i thilthaw tahai chu thung sienla che, LALPA, Israel- hai Pathien, inhumhimna dinga a thla hnuoi i hung phên chun, i ṭhat man pe ṭeu raw se che,” tiin."
13,"Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.","Chun, amain, “Pu, nangin i mi thlamuon a, i siehlaw nunghâkhai laia mi ni naw lang khawm, ngil- neitaka i mi biek hi ka ta dingin lunginsiettu ropuitak i nih,” a tih a."
14,"And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof.","Chun, bu fâk hunah Boaz chun a kuomah, “Taka hin hung la, beihai hi hung fa ve la, i bei tlanghai chu uoin thûrah inchie ve rawh,” a tih a. Chuongchun, busîktuhai kâwla chun a ṭhung a; chun, buzeu chu an pêk a, a fâk a, a khawp hnung khawm chun fâk sênglo a la nei ta rawp a."
15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.","Chun, buhnung zawng dinga ân thawk nâwk chun, Boaz chun a tlangvâlhai kuomah, “Buphal laia mi khawm rût sienla, hal naw ro."
16,"And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.","Chun, a têla mi khawm kei- dawkpêk unla, mâksan pei unla, rût raw se, hal naw ro,” tiin a hril a."
17,"So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.","Chuongchun, loa buhnung chu zântieng chenin a zawng khâwm a, a zawngsa chu a vuok a, buṭei epha khat zet a nih."
18,"And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.","Chun, a phur a, khuo tieng a fe tah a; chun, a bu zawng khâwm chu a tarpinu chu ân entir a, a khawp hnunga a fâk sênglo khawm chu a phawr a, a pêk a."
19,"And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.","A tarpinu chun a kuomah, “Vawisûn khan khâw tienga buhnung am i zawng a? Khâwlai am sin i thawh a? A lo hre nuomtu che chu malsâwmin um raw se,” a tih a."
20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.","Ama chun tu kuom am sin a va thaw ti a tarpinu chu a hril a, “Vawisûna sin ka va thawnapa hming chu Boaz a nih,” tiin. Chun, Naomiin a monu kuoma chun, “LALPA, a lung- insietnaa mi dam le mithi thlathlam ngainawtu chun, ama chu malsâwm raw se,” a tih a. Naomi bawk chun a kuomah, “Ama chu ei inhnaipui, ei laibung bul a nih,” a tih a."
21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.","Chun, Moab mi Ruth chun, “A ni ngei chu tie, ka kuoma khawm, ‘Ka bu hi an sîk zo vawng hmakhat chun, ka siehlawhai lai hin ṭhang ve zing rawh,’ a mi ti nghe nghe an naw,” a tih a."
22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field.","Chun, Naomi chun a monu Ruth kuomah, “Ka naunu, lo danga an hmu dêr nawna ding chein, a siehlaw nunghâkhai lai ruok chun fe la ṭhang a tih,” a tih a."
23,"So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.","Chuongchun, buṭei le bupui sîk zo chenin, Boaz siehlaw nunghâkhai lai ruok chun buhnung zawngin a fe hlak a; chun, a tarpinu kuoma chun a um a."
