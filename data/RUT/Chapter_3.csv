1,"And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?","Chun, a tarpinu Naomi chun a kuomah, “Ka naunu, i ta dinga khawsakna ṭha ka zawngpêk naw ding che am a nih?"
2,"And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.","Boaz, a siehlaw nunghâkhai laia sin i va thawnapa kha ei laibung bul a ni naw am a nih? Ngai ta, vawizân hin buṭei hrizâwlah a zâp fai ding a nih."
3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor, but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.","Insil la, sahriek innâl la, i incheina puon ṭha takhai sil la, hri- zâwla chun zu fe rawh: amiruokchu, ama chu fâk le dâwn ân zo hmakhat chu a kuomah inhriettir dêr naw rawh."
4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.","Chun, a zâl phaleh a zâlna chu inchik la, lût la, a ke hlîm la zâl rawh; chun, amain i thaw ding chu lo hril a ti che,” a tih a."
5,"And she said unto her, All that thou sayest I will do.","Ruth chun a dawn a, “I hril taphawt chu thâwng ka tih,” tiin."
6,"And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.","Chuongchun, hrizâwla chun a zu feh a, a tarpinuin a hril ang tak chun a thawh a."
7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.","Chun, Boaz chu bu a fâka a dâwn zo chun a lungril a hung hlim ta hleh a, bu hlûm bula zâl dingin a fe tah a. Ruth chu to ṭawkin a va feh a, a ke chu a hlîma a zâl ve tah a."
8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.","Zânrilah chupa chu inlâurakin a ṭhanghar a, a hei inlet a; a ke thluona nuhmei lo zâl ve zing chu a hmuh a."
9,"And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.","Chun, ama chun, “Tu am i nih a?” a tih a. Ama chun, “I siehlawnu Ruth ka nih, i siehlawnu hi i puon mi hung kêuzawm rawh; ka laibung bul i ni sih a,” a tih a."
10,"And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter: thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.","Ama chun, ka naunu LALPAIN malsâwm raw se che; tlangvâl pasie amanih hausa i zui nawa hin a hma- saa nêk hmanin a hi hnunga mia hin ṭhatna i suklang nasa ta lem a nih."
11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a worthy woman.","Tuhin, “ka naunu, ṭi naw rawh; i hni taphawt thawpêk pei ka ti che; ka khaw mi chanpui po poin nuhmei feltak i nih ti an hriet seng sih a."
12,And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.,"Chun, tuhin, laibung bul chu ka ni ngei el; amiruokchu, keia nêka hnai lem a um a."
13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as Jehovah liveth: lie down until the morning.","Vawizân chu um phawt el la, zingkâr ama chun i ta dinga laibung chan chu a thaw nuom chun ṭhang a ta, thaw raw se; amiruokchu, laibung chan chu a thawpêk nuom naw che chun, LALPA hringna sâlin, laibung chan chu thawpêk ngei ka ti che, zingkâr chenin zâl zing el rawh,” a tih a."
14,"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.","Chuongchun, zingkâr chenin a ke thluona chun a zâl tah a, chun tukhawm lân hmu chieng thei hmain a tho a; chun, ama chun, “Hrizâwla chun nuhmei chu a hung ti tu- khawmin hre naw raw se,” a tih a."
15,"And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.","Chun, “I puon bât kha hung la la dâw rawh,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a dawh a, buṭei chu tekhâwng ruk ân khi suok a, a sung a, ân phurtir a, chun, khuoa chun a fe tah a."
16,"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.","A tarpinu kuom a hang tlung chun, “Ka naunu, ieng am i chang a?” a lo tih a. Ama chun, chu mipain thil a thawpêk po po chu a hril vawng a."
17,"And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said, Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.","“Hi buṭei tekhâwng ruk hi a mi pêk a, ‘I tarpinu kuoma chun kut ruokin fe dêr naw ti nih,’ a mi ti a nih,” tiin."
18,"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka naunu, ieng angin am thil a hung um ding ti i hriet hma chun nghâk el rawh, vawisûn niha hi thil hi a thaw zo hmakhat chun ama chu a to el âwm si nawh a,” a tih a."
