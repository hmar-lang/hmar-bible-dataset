1,"And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.","Rorêltuhaiin ro an rêl laiin chu rama chun ṭâm a hung tlah a, chun, Juda ram Bethlehema mi pakhat Moab rama um dingin, ama le a nuhmei le a naupasalhai pahni chu an feh a."
2,"And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.","Chu mipa hming chu Elimelek a nih, a nuhmei hming chu Naomi, a naupasalhai pahni hming chu Mahlon le Kilion an nih; Juda ram, Bethlehema Ephrath mi an nih. Moab rama chun an feh a, chutaka chun an um ta zing a."
3,"And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.","Nisienlakhawm, Elimelek, Nao- mi pasal chu, a thih a, amanu le a naupasalhai pahni chau chu an um tah a."
4,"And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.","Chuhai chun Moab nuhmeihai nuhmeiah an nei a, pakhat hming chu Orpah a nih a, pakhat dang hming chu Ruth a nih. Chutaka chun kum sâwm lai an um a."
5,And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.,"Chun, Mahlon le Kilion chu an thi ve veh a; chuongchun, chu nuhmei chu a naupasalhai pahni le a pasal chun an thi san tah a."
6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread.","Chun, Moab rama inthawkin, LALPAIN a mihai chu kanin fâk ding a pêkzie thu a lo hriet leiin, a mohai pahni leh Moab rama inthawk kîr nâwk dingin ân thawk suok a."
7,"And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.","Chuongchun, a umnaa inthawk chun a mohai pahni le chun a suok a, Juda rama kîr nâwk dingin an fe tah a."
8,"And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother’s house: Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.","Chun, Naomi chun a mohai pahni kuoma chun, “Fe unla, in nuhai in ve veah kîr nâwk el ta ro; mithihai chunga le ka chunga in thaw ang tak hin, LALPAIN in chungah ngilnei- takin thaw ve raw se."
9,"Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.","Pasal dang ina khawsakna in tuok ve ve theina dingin LALPAIN ngaituopêk raw se cheu,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a fâwp a, râwl insuo meuin an ṭap ta rak el a."
10,"And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.","Anni chun, “Ni lo e, i chihai kuoma i kîrnaa chun hung zui kan ti che,” an tih a."
11,"And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?","Naomi chun, “Ka naunuhai, kîr nâwk lem ro, iengdingin am mi zui in tih a? In pasal ding naupasalhai ka la vawn zing am a nih?"
12,"Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband to-night, and should also bear sons;","Kîr nâwk unla, ka naunuhai, fe el lem ro, pasal hang nei dingin ka upa taluo ta sih a. Beiseina ka la nei tiin, vawizân hin pasal nei elin nau- pasalhai nei ding hrim lang khawm,"
13,"would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me.","an puitling chenin in nghâk el ding am a nih? Chu chu lei chun pasal nei loin in um el ding am a nih? Ni lo e, ka naunuhai, ka chunga LALPA kut hieng anga a hung tla ta hi, nangni ta ding hin ka lung a na bêk bêk a nih,” a tih a."
14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her.","Chuongchun, an râwlhai insuo meuin an ṭap rak rak nâwk a; chun, Orpah chun a tarpinu chu a fâwp a, Ruth ruok chun amanu chu a chel tlat a."
15,"And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister-in-law.","Chun, amanu chun, “En ta, i mo chanpuinu chu a chihai kuoma le a pathien kuoma chun a kîr nâwk tah a, nang khawm i mo chanpuinu zuiin kîr nâwk el rawh aw,” a tih a."
16,"And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;","Nisienlakhawm, Ruth chun, “Nang kîrsan ding che le zui lo ding chein mîn fui naw rawh; i fena phawtah fêng ka ta, i riekna phawtah riek ka ta, i chihai chu ka chihai nîng an ta, i Pathien chu ka Pathien nîng a ta;"
17,"where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.","i thinaa chun thîng ka ta, chutaka chun phûmin um ve el ka tih. Nang le kei hi thina chau naw thil dangin a mi ṭhe ding chun LALPAIN a law law mi law el sienla, chu nêka nasa khawmin,” a tih a."
18,"And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.",Naomi chun ama zui a tum tlat a nih ti a hrietin a tosan tah a.
19,"So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and the women said, Is this Naomi?","Chuongchun, an pahni chun Bethlehem chenin an fe tah a. Bethlehem an tlung chun anni lei chun a khaw phêkin an inhnîng ta sup sup el a; chun, nuhmeihai chun, “Hi hi Naomi kha a ni maw?” an tih a."
20,"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Naomi mi ti naw ro, Marah mi ti lem ro, Iengkimthawthei chun lungsiet- thlâktakin a mi thaw ta sih a."
21,"I went out full, and Jehovah hath brought me home again empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?","Buriptakin ka suok a, LALPA chun kutbenthekin a mi ṭhuoi kîr nâwk a ni hi: LALPA chun ka chung- ah a lungninawna a suklang a, Iengkimthawthei chun a mi sukrimsi ta hnungin, iengdinga Naomi in mi la ti rawp am a na?” a tih a."
22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.","Chuongchun, Naomi chu a hung kîr a, a monu Moab mi Ruth leh, Moab rama inthawk a hung kîr a nih. Bethlehem chu buṭei sîk hun ṭantirin an hung tlung a nih."
