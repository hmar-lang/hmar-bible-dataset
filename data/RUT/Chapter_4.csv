1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.","Chuongchun, Boaz chu kul kawtkhâra chun a hang feh a, chutaka chun a ṭhung a. An laibung bul Boazin a hril kha a hung chun, “Ruola, taka hin la hung la, hung ṭhung ta,” a tih a. Ama chu a va feh a, ân ṭhung a."
2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.","Chun, chu khuoa mi upa sâwm a ṭhuoi a, an kuomah, “Hitaka hin ṭhung ta u khai,” a tih a; chuongchun, an ṭhung tah a."
3,"And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:","Chun, an laibung bul kuoma chun, “Moab rama inthawka hung kîr nâwk Naomi chun ei unaupa Elimelek ram kha a zawr a."
4,"and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.","Chuleiin, hi thu hi hril cheha i kuomah, ‘Hitaka ṭhunghai mithmua le ka mihai upahai mithmua hin inchaw rawh. În tlan nuom chun intlan la, în tlan naw ding chun mi hril rawh, ka hriet theina dingin, nang naw chu a hang intlan ding âwm tu dang khawm an um si nawh a; chun, nanga dawta chun kei ka nih,’ tiha inhriettir che ṭûlin ka hriet a,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Intlan ka tih,” a tih a."
5,"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.","Boaz chun, “Naomi kuta in- thawka ram chu în châwk ni chun mithi nuhmei Moab mi Ruth în châwk sa ding a nih, amaa inthawka mithi hming chu dei loa a ro hluo ding an um theina dingin,” a tih a."
6,"And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.","An laibung bul chun, “Keia ta ding chun kân tlan thei nawh, keima rohluona ding tieng sukbuoi rawi ka tih, intlan theitu ka nina ai chu nangin chang el rawh, kei chun chu kân tlan thei naw a ni hi,” a tih a."
7,"Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.","Tienlaia Israelhai laia thil iengkim an sukdetna dinga an intlan dân le an inthleng dân chu hieng hi a nih: Pakhatin kekawk a hlîp a, mi dang chu a pêk a, chu chu Israelhai laia thil sukdet dân a nih."
8,"So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.","Chuongchun, an laibung bul chun Boaz kuomah, “Nangin i ta dingin inchaw lem rawh,” tiin a kekawk chu a hlîp tah a."
9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.","Boaz chun upahai le mipui po po kuoma chun, “Vawisûn hin nangni hi, Elimelek thil nei po po le Kilion le Mahlon thil nei po po Naomi kuta inthawkin kân châwk tah ti hretuhai in nih."
10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.","Chu chau chu ni loin, mithi chu a hming a um zingna dinga rohluotu siempêk dingin le, mithi chu a unau- haia le a umna kul kawtkhâra a hming a bo nawna dingin, Moab nuhmei Ruth, Mahlon nuhmei chu ka nuhmei dingin kân châwk a, vawisûn hin chu hrepuituhai chu nangni hi in nih,” a tih a."
11,"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:","Chun, kul kawtkhâra mipui po po le upahai chun, “Hrepuituhai kan nih. I ina nuhmei hung lût chu, Israel sûngkuo indintu pahni Rakil le Leah ang khan LALPA chun siem raw se; chun, Ephrathaa chun tluongtlung- takin um la, Bethlehema chun hminginthangtakin um rawh;"
12,"and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman.","chun, LALPAIN hi nunghâka inthawka a thla a la siempêk ding che lei chun, i sûngkuo chu Tamarin Juda a neipêk Perez sûngkuo ang hung ni raw se,” an tih a."
13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bare a son.","Chuleiin, Boaz chun Ruth chu a ṭhuoi a, a nuhmei a hung ni tah a; ama chu a pâwl a, LALPAIN Ruth chu nau ân paitir a, naupasal a nei tah a."
14,"And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.","Chuongchun, nuhmeihai chun Naomi kuomah, “LALPA chu inpâk- in um raw se. Ama chun laibung boin a thlathlam naw cheh a; a hming chu Israel ramah hung inthang raw se!"
15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.","Ama chu i ta dingin hringna tungding nâwktu le i tar tieng châwmtu hung ni raw se; i monu, a hmangaitu che hi, naupasal pasari nêkin i ta dingin a tam lem a, ama chun naupa a neipêk ta che hi,” an ta."
16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.","Chuongchun, Naomi chun naute chu a lâk a, a ângsûngah a pawm a; chun, ama dawntu chu a hung ni tah a."
17,"And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.","Chun, a tuolbâwm nuhmei- hai chun, nau hming chu an hung sak a, “Naomiin naupasal a nei tah,” tiin a hmingah Obed an sak a; ama chu, David pa Jesai a pa a hung nih."
18,"Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron,","Chuongchun, Perez thlahai chu hienghai hi an nih: Perez chu Hezron pa a na,"
19,"and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,","Hezron chu Ram pa a na, Ram chu Amminadab pa a na,"
20,"and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,","Amminadab chu Nason pa a na, Nason chu Salmon pa a na,"
21,"and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,","Salmon chu Boaz pa a na, Boaz chu Obed pa a na,"
22,"and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.","Obed chu Jesai pa a na, Jesai chu David pa a nih."
