1,"But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,","Nisienlakhawm, Thlarau chun chiengtakin a hril: nakie pha chun mi ṭhenkhathai chun ṭhuoi hmangna thlarauhai le khawhrihai inchûktirna thu ngaisakin ringna chu la bânsan an tih, mi khêlhliphai vervêkna leiin ti hi."
2,"through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;","Chuong mi khêlhliphai chu anni sie le ṭha hrietna ngeia thîr linga bel ang an na,"
3,"forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.","innei an khap hlak a, iengkhat fâk dinghai (thutak hrea ringtuhai lâwmthu hrila pawm dinga Pathienin a isiemhai chu) fâk naw ding an ti hlak."
4,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:","Pathien thilsiem tinrêng hi a ṭha sih a, lâwmthu hrila pawm a ni taphawt chun iengkhawm dit naw ding a ni nawh,"
5,for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.,Pathien thu le ṭawngṭainain sukthieng a ni ta sih a.
6,"If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed until now:","Chuonghai chu unauhai în hriettir chun, Krista Isu rawng- bâwltu ṭhatak nîng i tih, ringna le inchûktirna ṭha tu chena i la zâwm thuah châwm i ni ang khan."
7,but refuse profane and old wives’ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:,"Amiruokchu, Pathien inza nâw- na le pitarhai tienami thu mei mei chu dit naw rawh. Chun, Pathien ngaisak dingin insawizawi rawh."
8,"for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.","Taksa insawizawina hi ṭhahnem chu a ṭhahnem ve bawk a, Pathien ngaisakna ruok hin chu, hringna tuta umsa le la hung um ding pêk tiemna a nei leiin kawng tinrêngah a ṭhahnem a nih."
9,"Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.",Hi thu hi ring a umin pawm tlâk bêk bêk a nih.
10,"For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.","Chuongchun, Pathien hring chu ei awi leiin sin ei inrim a; ei thaw hrâm hrâm a nih, ama chu mi po po sandamtu a na, ama ringtuhai sandamtu a ni bîk tak a nih."
11,These things command and teach.,"Chuong thu chu pe la, inchûktir rawh."
12,"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.","I naupangna tûkhawmin ngai- nêp naw raw hai seh, thu hril kawnga dâm, chângzie kawnga dâm, hmangaina kawnga dâm, ringna kawnga dâm, inthiengna kawnga dâm, ringtuhai sukhmutu ni lem raw khai."
13,"Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.","Ka hung hmakhat chu tiem dâm, thu hril dâm, inchûktir dâm thaw rawh."
14,"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.","Nangmaa um, thilpêk hril lâwk ta anga, upahai kut innghata, Pathienin ân neitir che kha thla- thlam naw."
15,Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.,"Mi po po kuomah i ṭhathnemna ân lang theina dingin chuongahai chun taima la, chuonga chun in- hmang zo rawh."
16,"Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.","Nangma le i inchûktirnaa chun fimkhur la, chuong thilhai chu thawin um zing rawh; chuong anga thawin nangma le i thu ngaituhai chu i sandam ding a nih."
