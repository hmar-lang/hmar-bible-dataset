1,"Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine be not blasphemed.","Pathien hming le a închûktirna thu hrilsieta a um nâwna dingin, suok rîngkawl bât taphawthai chun anni puhai iengkimah chawimawi tlâkah ngai raw hai se."
2,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. These things teach and exhort.","Chun, ringtu pu neihai chun, unau an ni leiin ngainêp naw raw hai se; amiruokchu, ṭhathnemna hmutu- hai chu ringtu le dittakhai an ni leiin an rawng bâwlpêk zuol lem raw hai se. Hieng thu hi inchûktir la, infui rawh."
3,"If any man teacheth a different doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;","Mi tûkhawmin inchûktirna dang ân chûktir a, thutak (Ei Lalpa Isu Krista thu) le, Pathien ngaisakna inchûktirna tieng a awi naw chun,"
4,"he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,","ama chu a chapo a, iengkhawm a hriet nawh a, hriet nêk hmanin insêl le thu kal kawnga chun ân vêt ta lem a nih. Chuonga inthawk chun, inhnarna dâm, insuolna dâm, hril- sietna dâm, a ṭha naw tieng ringna dâm a hung suok a,"
5,"wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.","lungril sie nei le thutak nei naw mi nina, sêlhrâtna dâm a suok hlak; chuonghai chu, Pathien ngaisak hi hlâwkna amanih titu an nih."
6,But godliness with contentment is great gain:,Pathien ngaisak hi lungawina ṭhang chun hlâwkna nasatak a ni hrim a nih.
7,"for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out;","Khawvêla hin iengkhawm ei lûtpui nawh a, iengkhawm ei suokpui thei bawk nawh."
8,but having food and covering we shall be therewith content.,"Nisienlakhawm, fâk ding le sil ding neiin, chuonga chun lungawi ei tih."
9,"But they that are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.","Amiruokchu, hausak tumtuhai chu thlêmnaa dâm, chânga dâm, invêtthlâk le sukkhawhlo thei inhâwkna tamtaka dâm an tlu lût a, chuong inhâwknahai chun sietna le bohmangnaah mi a suktlum hlak."
10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.","Tangka sum ngainat hi suol tinrêng bul a ni sih a; chu chu ṭhenkhatin an inhnar a, ringna chu an fe hmang san a, anni le anni lungngaina tamtakin an insun tlang ta nghuon a."
11,"But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.","Nisienlakhawm, nang Pathien mi, chuong thilhai chu tlânsan la, felna dâm, Pathien ngaisakna dâm, ringna dâm, hmangaina dâm, daw- theina dâm, thuhnuoirawlna dâm hnawt pei rawh."
12,"Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.","Ringna inruolsiekna ṭha chu thaw la, chatuon hringna chu chel rawh; chu chu chang dinga ko i na, hretu tamtakhai mithmuah ṭanna ṭha chu i ṭan ta kha."
13,"I charge thee in the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;","Pathien thil tinrêng sukhringtu le, Krista Isu, Pontia Pilat hmaa ṭanna ṭha ṭantu mithmua chun, thu ka pêk che;"
14,"that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:",ei Lalpa Isu hung inlar nâwk hmakhat chu thupêk kha sawisêlbo le inthiengtaka pawm dingin.
15,"which in its own times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;","Chu inlârna chu a hun taka chun inpâktlâk thuneitu tak chau, laltakhai laltak, lalhai lal chun inentir a ti che."
16,"who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power eternal. Amen.","Ama chau chun thi thei nawna a nei a, var hnai thei ruol loa chun a um a, ama chu tûkhawmin an hmu ngai nawh a, hmu khawm an hmu thei naw bawk a, ama kuoma chun chatuona chawimawina le thilthawtheina chu um raw se. Amen."
17,"Charge them that are rich in this present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;","Hi khawvêla hausahai hi chapo naw ding le sum ringum nawah an beiseina innghat loa, thil po po lâwm- na dinga mi petu Pathien chunga chun innghat lem dingin kâwk rawh."
18,"that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;","Thil ṭha thaw dingin, thil ṭha thaw hau dingin, tiktlaia thâwlâwm pe pei dingin,"
19,"laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which is life indeed.","hringna, hringna taktak chu an vawng theina dingin, hun hung tlung dinga ding chun lungphûm ṭhatak an ta dinga lo rem dingin infui rawh."
20,"O Timothy, guard that which is committed unto thee, turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;","Aw Timothe, i kuoma inkawltira um chu kawl ṭha rawh, Pathien inzâ naw tieng thu hril mei mei le, indik nawtaka, “Varna,” an iti insêlna hi nghat san rawh."
21,which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.,"Chu chu ṭhenkhathaiin nei amanih insâwnin, ringna chu an fe kawisan tah a. Lunginsietna in kuomah um raw se."
