verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren:","Putar deuhai chu hal naw la, pa angin thlêm lem rawh; tlang- lakhai chu unau angin;"
2,"the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.","pitar deuhai chu nu angin, nunghâkhai chu inthiengtakin farnu angin."
3,Honor widows that are widows indeed.,"Hmeithai, hmeithai taktakhai chu chawimawi rawh."
4,"But if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.","Nisienlakhawm, hmeithai tû- khawmin nauhai amanih, tuhai amanih nei sienla, chuonghai chun anni insûng tienga Pathien ngaisaka um dân le, anni keitleituhai chunga ṭhatzie inchûk zet raw hai se; chu chu Pathien lâwm zâwng a ni sih a."
5,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.","Hmeithai taktak mâkhât chaua um chun Pathien chungah beiseina a nei tlat a, a sûn a zânin hni le ṭawng- ṭaiin a um rawp hlak."
6,But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.,"Nisienlakhawm, hmeithai mâni inhawitirna ngawta inpe chu, a dam lai khawm a thi a nih."
7,"These things also command, that they may be without reproach.",Sawisêlboa an um theina dingin chuong thu khawm chu pe rawh.
8,"But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.","Nisienlakhawm, tûkhawmin mâ- ni mihai ta ding a ngaituo lâwk naw a, mâni insûnga mihai ta ding hman a ngaituo lâwk naw chun, ringna chu ân phat san a, awi naw mi nêkin a suol lem a nih."
9,"Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,","Hmeithaihai kum sâwmruk chen hnuoi tieng ni loa, mi pakhat nuhmei lo ni ta chu hmeithaia ziek thei a nih-"
10,"well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath washed the saints’ feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work.","thil ṭha thaw kawnga mi inpâka um tah, nauhai lo châwm tlei taa, mikhuolhai lo intlungtir taa, mi inthienghai ke lo sâwp taa; lungin- zînghai lo sawmdâwl taa, thil ṭha tinrêng taimataka a lo thaw ta phawt chun."
11,"But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;","Hmeithai la nunghâk deuhai chu ziek nuom naw rawh; Krista tieng an det nawin, pasal nei an nuom hlak sih a;"
12,"having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.",an thutiem hmasa chu an bawsiet hlak leiin thiemnaw changin an um hlak a nih.
13,"And withal they learn also to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.","Chu naw khawm chu, in tinah an lêng lâwr a, thabo khawm an chîng hlak a, thabo chau khawm ni loin, thu hril naw ding ding hrilin, bau tam le mihai thil thaw dempêk an hmang bawk a nih."
14,"I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, give no occasion to the adversary for reviling:","Chuongchun, hmeithai la nu- nghâk deuhai chu pasal nei hai sienla, nauhai nei sienla, insûng khawsak rel hai sienla, sawisêlna ding remchâng hrim hmêlma chu inhmutir naw hai sienla ka nuom a nih."
15,for already some are turned aside after Satan.,Tu khawm hin mi ṭhenkhat chu Setana tieng panin an pêt hmang ta sih a.
16,"If any woman that believeth hath widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.","Ringtu nuhmeiin hmeithaihai kawl nei sienla, amain sawmdâwl raw se; Kohran chu sukbuoiin um naw raw se, hmeithai taktakhai chu an sawmdâwl theina dingin."
17,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.",Kohran upa ro rêl ṭhahai chu a lêt hnia chawimawi tlâka ngai ni raw hai se; thu hril le inchûktirna kawnga sininrimhai chu chawimawi tlâka ngai nâwk zuol ni raw hai se.
18,"For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his hire.","Pathien Lekha Thu chun, “Sebâwng chalin bu a chîl laiin a hmûr khit naw rawh,” a tih a. “Sinthawtu chu a hlaw hmu tlâk a nih,” a ti bawk a."
19,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, except at the mouth of two or three witnesses.","Kohran upa an hêkna chu hretu pahni amanih, pathum amanih baua inthawk naw chu pawm naw."
20,"Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.",Thil suksuoltuhai chu mi po po hmaah kâwk rawh; mi dang khawma an ṭi ve theina dingin.
21,"I charge thee in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.","Hieng thu hi thlier bîk nei loin, thlier bîk neia iengkhawm thaw loin, Pathien le Krista Isu le Vântirko thlanghai mithmuin zâwm dingin ṭhahnemngaitakin kân hriettir che."
22,"Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.","Tû chunga khawm kut innghat thut naw la, mi dang suolnahaia chun ṭhang bawk naw; insukthieng zing rawh."
23,"Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.","Tui chau dâwn mi ni ta naw la, i phîng lei le i damnaw rawp leiin uoin tlâwmtê hmang hlak rawh."
24,"Some men’s sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.","Mi ṭhenkhat suolhai chu ân lang zing a, rorêlna chu a tlung hmasa hlak; mi ṭhenkhat suol chun an hnungah a zui lem hlak."
25,In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.,"Chuong ang bawkin thil thaw ṭhat ân lang zing chi a um a, chuong ang nawhai khawm chu thup thei a ni nawh."
