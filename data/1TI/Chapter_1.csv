1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;","Paula, Pathien a mi Sandamtu le Krista Isu ei Beiseina ruot anga Krista Isu Tirko chun;"
2,"unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.","Ringnaa ka nau taktak Timothe kuomah: Pathien ei Pa le, ei Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka lunginsietna dâm, zângaina dâm, inremna dâm hung um raw se."
3,"As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,","Makedonia rama ka fe ding laia Ephesia um zing dinga ka ngên che ang khan, mi ṭhenkhathai chu inchûktirna danglam hrim inchûktir lo dinga i kâwk theina ding le,"
4,"neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; so do I now.",tienami mei mei le sui sêng lo thlatuhai thu (ringnaa Pathien khawsakzie um hi sukṭhat nêka insêlna siem lem hlaktu chu) ngaisak lo dinga kâwk dingin tu khawm hin ka la ngên rawp che a nih.
5,But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:,"Nisienlakhawm, kâwkna san chu lungril inthieng le, sie le ṭha hrietna inthieng le, ringna taktaka inthawka hung suok hmangaina chu an nei theina dingin a nih;"
6,from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking;,"mi ṭhenkhathai an fe kâwi leiin chu chu an pêtsan a, thu teplo hrilna tieng an fe ta lem a."
7,"desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm.","An thu hril umzie le ngamtaka an thu hril chanchin chu hre si loin, Dân inchûktirtuhai ni an nuom hlak a nih."
8,"But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,","Dân chu a ṭha ti ei hriet sih a, miin a hmang ṭha phawt chun."
9,"as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,","Hieng hi hre hai sienla, “Dân hi mi feltak ta dinga siem a ni nawh a, dân pawisa nawhai le dân bawsiehai ta ding dâm, mi inthieng nawhai le Pathien inzâ nawhai ta ding dâm, pahai thattuhai le nuhai thattuhai ta ding dâmin,"
10,"for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;","indit hmanghai ta ding dâm, mawngkawhurhai ta ding dâm, mihriem inru hmanghai ta ding dâm, khêl hril hmanghai ta ding dâm, inkhâm tehlêm hmanghai ta ding dâm, inchûktirna indik ang ni loa thil dang hrim;"
11,"according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.",inpâktlâk Pathien Chanchin Ṭha ropui inchûktirna indik ka kuomah inkawltira um ang ni lo ta ding chun siem a ni lem.
12,"I thank him that enabled me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to his service;","A mi sukhrâttu Krista Isu ei Lalpa kuoma chun lâwmthu ka hril a nih; ringumah a mi ngai a, a rawng- bâwltuah a mi ruot ta leiin."
13,"though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;","Inhma chun hrilsetu le suknawm- natu le sawisatu ni lang khawm, awi naw puma hre loa thaw ka ni leiin zângaina chu ka hmu a nih;"
14,and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.,chun ei Lalpa lunginsietna chu ringna le Krista Isu hmangainain nasatakin a liem tah a.
15,"Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:","“Krista Isu mi suolhai sandam dingin khawvêla hin a hung,” ti hi ring a umin, pawm tlâk tak a nih; anni laia mi suol tak ka ni hi."
16,"howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life.","Nisienlakhawm, hi lei hin a nih, zângaina ka hmu chu, Isu Krista chun mi suol tak keimaa hin a daw- theizie po po ân langtir theina dingin, tuta chen chu chatuon hringna hmu dinga ama la hung awi dinghai khîkhmûna dingin."
17,"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.","Laltak chatuona um, se thei lo, hmu thei lo Pathien tak chau chu chatuona chawimawi le ropuiin um raw se. Amen."
18,"This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare;","Ka nau Timothe, inhmaa i chanchin an hril lâwk thuhai ang khan chu kâwkna thu chu kân kawltir che; chuong le chun, indona ṭha chu i do theina dingin;"
19,holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith:,"ringna le sie le ṭha hrietna inthiengtak pawm tlatin. Mi ṭhen- khathaiin chuong chu pei thlain, ringna kawnga chun lawngkawi angin an kawi se tah a."
20,"of whom is Hymenæus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.",Chuhai lai chun Humenai le Alexander an na; Pathien hrilsiet naw an inchûk theina dingin anni chu Setan ka pêk a nih.
