1,"Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.","Jeriko khuo chu Israel thlahai lei chun an khâr tlat a, tukhawm an suok nawh a, tukhawm an lût bawk nawh."
2,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “En ta, Jeriko le a lal le mi hrât huoisenhai hi i kutah ka pêk tah."
3,"And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.",Râl kâp mi po po hin khawpui hi vêlin vawikhat chu hang vêl suok phawt in ta; chuong ang ruok chun ni ruk in thaw ding a nih.
4,"And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.","Chun, thiempu pasariin bâwm hma tieng berâmchal ki tawtawrâwt pasari chawi an ta; chun, a ni sari ni chun khawpui chu vawi sari vêl suok in ta, chun, thiempuhai chun taw- tawrâwthai chu mût an tih."
5,"And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.","Chun, berâmchal ki an mût rik ruoi ruoi a, tawtawrâwt ri in hriet pha chun, mipui po po chu inring- takin khêk dur dur raw se; chuong- chun, khawpui kul chu chim rup a ta, mipui chu mâni hma zâwn sengah chun hang fêng an tih,” a ta."
6,"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah.","Chun, Nun naupa Josua chun thiempuhai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Thuthlung bâwm hi zâwn unla, thiempu pasariin LALPA bâwm hmatienga chun berâmchal ki taw- tawrâwt pasari chawi raw se,” a ta."
7,"And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah.","Chun, ama chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “Fe pei unla, khawpui chu vêl suok ro, chun, inrâlthuomhai kha LAL- PA bâwm hmatieng fe pei raw se,” a ta."
8,"And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.","Josuain mipuihai kuoma thu a hril zo chun LALPA hmaa berâmchal ki tawtawrâwt pasari chawi thiempu pasarihai chu an fe pei a, tawtawrâwt chu an mût a; chun, LALPA thu- thlung bâwm chun a zui a."
9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.","Chun, inrâlthuomhai chu taw- tawrâwt mûttu thiempuhai hmaa chun an feh a, chun a hnungdâlhai chun bâwm chu an sawm a, thiem- puhai chun fe malamin tawtawrâwt chu an mût pei a."
10,"And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.","Chun, Josua chun mipuihai chu, “Khêk dêr naw unla, in râwl khawm hriet ni naw raw se, khêk dinga thu ka pêk ni cheu a tlung hmakhat chu in bâua inthawkin thu hrim hrim suok bawk naw sien, chu pha ruok chun chu khêk ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
11,"So he caused the ark of Jehovah to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.","Chuongchun, LALPA bâwm chun khawpui chu vêl khat ân vêl suoktir a; chun, riebûka chun an feh a, riebûka chun an riek tah a."
12,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.","Chun, Josua chu zingkâr in- hmatakin a tho a, thiempuhai chun LALPA bâwm chu an zâwn a."
13,"And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Jehovah, the priests blowing the trumpets as they went.","Chun, LALPA bâwm hmaa be- râmchal ki tawtawrâwt pasari chawi thiempu pasarihai kha an fe pei a; tawtawrâwt an mût a; chun, inrâl- thuomhai chu an hmaah an feh a; chun, a hnungdâlhai chun LALPA bâwm chu an sawm a, thiempuhai chun, fe malamin tawtawrâwt an mût pei a."
14,"And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.","Chun, a ni hni ni chun khawpui chu vawi khat an hang vêl suok nâwk a, riebûka chun an kîr nâwk a; chuong ang ruok chun ni ruk an thawh a."
15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.","A ni sari ni chun zîngkâr vâr- ṭienin an tho a, thaw dân pângngaiin vawi sari an vêl suok a, chu ni chau chun khawpui chu vawi sari an vêl suok a nih."
16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Jehovah hath given you the city.","A vawi sarinaa thiempuhaiin tawtawrâwt an hang mût chun Josua chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “Khêk ro khai, LALPAIN khawpui hi a pêk ta cheu a nih."
17,"And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.","Khawpui hi a sûnga thil um po po pumin suksiet dinga LALPA kuoma pumpêk vawng ding a nih; Rahab nawchizawr chau, ama le a in sûnga ama le um po pohai ruok chu ei mi tirhai kha a lo thuphmang leiin hla ding a nih."
18,"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.","Nangni ruokchu suksiet dinga thil pumpêka inthawk chun insie- kieng hlau ro, chuong naw chun, suksiet dinga thil pumpêk laia mi ieng khawm lo lain, Israelhai riebûk hi suksiet dingah siem in ta, lunginzîngna intlun hlau rawi in tih."
19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.","Tangkaruo dâm, rângkachak dâm, dâr le thîr bûrlebêlhai ruok chu a rêngin LALPA kuoma inthieng a na, LALPA sum inah an lût vawng ding a nih,” a ta."
20,"So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.","Chuongchun, mipuihai chu an khêk a, tawtawrâwthai mût an nih a. Tawtawrâwt ri an hang hriet phingleh, an khêk ta dur dur a, kul chu a chim hmât vawng a; chuong- chun, mi tin chu mâni hma zawn senga chun an feh a, khawpuia chun an lût a, khawpui chu an lâk tah a."
21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.","Khawpui sûnga mi po po nuhmei pasal, a chîn a lien, bâwng- chal dâm, sabengtung dâm leh kâwl- hnâmin an sât hlum vawng tah a."
22,"And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.","Chun, Josua chun mi pahni ram va enthlatuhai kuoma chun, “Nâw- chizawr ina chun va lût unla, a kuoma ṭawng in lo inkhâm ta ang khan chu nuhmei chu a nei po po leh va ṭhuoi suok ro,” a ta."
23,"And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.","Chuongchun, enthlatu tlang- vâlhai chu an va lût a, Rahab le a pa le a nu leh, a unaupahai leh, a nei po pohai le chun an va ṭhuoi suok a, a laibung unauhai po po khawm an va ṭhuoi suok a, Israelhai riebûk puo- tienga chun an inumtir a."
24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.","Chun, khawpui chu a sûnga thil um po po leh meiin an raw vawng a, tangkaruo dâm, rângkachak dâm, dâr le thîr bûr le bêlhai chau chu LALPA in sum inah an sieh a."
25,"But Rahab the harlot, and her father’s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.","Amiruokchu, Rahab nawchi- zawr le a nei po po le a pa sûnghai chu Josua chun a hla vawng a; chuong- chun, Israelhai lai chun tu chen hin a la ṭhang ta zing a nih, Josuain Jeriko khuo enthla dinga a tirhai kha a lo thuphmang leiin."
26,"And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.","Chuong lai chun Josua chun, “Hi Jeriko khuo hi hung indina hung bâwl taphawt chu LALPA hmaa chun ṭawngsephurin um raw se, a nau lutîr chu chânin a lungphûm chu phûm a ta, a nau mitlum chânin a kul kawtkhârhai chu indin a tih,” tiin anni chu a vau a."
27,So Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.,"Chuongchun, LALPA chu Josua kuoma chun a um a, a ram pumpuia chun a hming a hung inthang tah a."
