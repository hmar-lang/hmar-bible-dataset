1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.","Chun, Jordan vadung thlang tienga um Amorhai lalhai po po le, tuisuoriet panga um Kanaan ram lal po pohai chun, an kai hmakhat chun LALPAIN Jordan tuihai chu Israel thlahai hmaa chun a sukkang- tan ti an lo hriet a, Israel thlahai lei chun an lungril chu ân tui zo tah a, annia chun lungril mumal hrim hrim a um ta nawh a."
2,"At that time Jehovah said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.","Chuong lai chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “Meitâwklung chemte siem la, Israel thlahai hi sertanna neipui nâwk rawh,” a ta."
3,"And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.","Chuongchun, Josua chun mei- tâwklung chemtehai a siem a, Israel thlahai chu Gibeath-haaraloth  a chun an ser a tanpêk a."
4,"And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.","Josua chun an ser a tanna san chu hi hi a nih: Aiguptaa inthawka suokhai po po, pasal, râl kâp mi po pohai kha Aiguptaa inthawka an suok hnung khan lam kârlakah thlalêra khan an thi zo tah a nih."
5,"For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.","A hung suokhai po po kha chu ser tan sa vawng an na, amiruokchu, Aiguptaa inthawka an suok a, thlalêra lam kârlaka pienghai po po kha chu ser tan an ni ve nawh."
6,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah: unto whom Jehovah sware that he would not let them see the land which Jehovah sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.","LALPA râwl an ngai nuom naw leiin mipui po po Aiguptaa inthawka hung suok, râl kap mihai chena, sukbohmanga an um vawng chenin Israel thlahai chu kum sâwmli zet thlalêra chun an invâk a, LALPAIN an thlatuhai kuoma nênetui le khuoi- zua luong ram inkhâma eini mi pêk a lo tiem kha, chu ram chu hmu lo dingin LALPAIN an kuomah ṭawng ân khâm a nih."
7,"And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.","Chuongchun, an thlahai anni aia ân ngîrhai chu Josua chun an ser a tanpêk a, lam kâra khan an ser tan a ni naw leiin, sertanlo an lo ni zing sih a,"
8,"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.","Chun, mipuihai po po ser an tan zo chun an dam hmakhat chu an riebûk mâni hmun sengah an um a."
9,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “Vawisûn hin Aigupta mihai hmusit- na cheu hi kân hlum hmang tah,” a ta. Chuongchun, chu hmun chu tu chen hin Gilgal an lo ti a nih."
10,And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.,"Israel thlahai chun Gilgala chun umhmun an khuor a; chun, Jeriko phaiahai chun chu thla ni sâwmpali ni, zântieng chun Fêkân Ruoiṭhe an hmang tah a."
11,"And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day.",Fêkân Ruoiṭhe zo tûk ni ngei chun chu rama bu chawl ṭhanglo bei le bu zêupuok an fâk a.
12,"And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.","Chu rama bu an fâk zînga inthawk chun manna kha a tla ta nawh a; Israel thlahai chun manna chu an dawng ta ngai bawk nawh, chu kum chun Kanaan rama bu le bâl chu an fâk ta lem a nih."
13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?","Chun, Josua chu Jeriko khaw bula a la um lai chun a dâk a, a hang en a; a hma zâwn ela chun mi pakhat a kâwlhnâm phawisa chawia lo ngîr zing hi a hmuh a. Josua chun a hang pan a, a kuoma chun, “Keini tienga ṭhang am i ni, kan hmêlmahai tieng?” a ta."
14,"And he said, Nay; but as prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?","Ama chun, “Ni lo e, LALPA sipaihai hotu dinga hung ka ni lem,” a tih a. Chuongchun, Josua chu hnuoiah a bawkkhup a, chibai a bûk a, a kuom- ah, “Ka Lalpa chun a siehlaw kuoma hin ieng am hril ding a nei a?” a ta."
15,"And the prince of Jehovah’s host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.","Chun LALPA sipaihai hotu chun Josua kuomah, “I kephaa in- thawkin i kekawk kha hlîp rawh, i ngîrna hmun kha ân thieng a nih ie,” a tih a. Chuongchun, Josua chun chuong ang chun a thaw tah a."
