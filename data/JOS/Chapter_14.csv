1,"And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,","Hienghai hi a nih Israel thla- haiin Kanaan ram an lâk, thiempu Eleazar hai, Nun naupa Josua hai, Israel thlahai hnam sûng- kaw puipahaiin an rochan dinga an lo semhai chu."
2,"by the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.","An rochan chu, LALPAIN Mosie thu a lo pêk ta angin, aisânin hnam kuo le hnam zâtve hai ta dinga sem a nih."
3,For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.,Mosie chun hnam hni le hnam zâtvehai kha Jordan râla khan an rochan ding a lo pêk ta sih a; Levi chihai ruok chu anni lai an rochan ding a pêk ve nawh.
4,"For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.","Josef thlahai chu hnam hni an na, Manasse le Ephraim chu; Levi chihai chu chu rama chun chanpuol an pêk ve nawh, an umna ding khaw- puihai le a khawkâwl vêl ran ruol tlatna hmun ding ti chau naw chu."
5,"As Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.","LALPAIN Mosie thu a lo pêk ta ang khan Israel thlahai chun an thawh a, ram chu an sem a."
6,"Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that Jehovah spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.","Chuongchun, Juda thlahai chu Gilgalah Josua kuomah an va feh a, Keniz mi Jephunne naupa Kaleb chun a kuomah, “Kades-barneaa Pathien mi Mosie kuoma LALPAIN ka chungchâng le nanga chungchâng thu a hril kha i hriet a."
7,Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.,"LALPA siehlaw Mosien Kades- barneaa inthawka ram va enthla dinga a mi tir lai khan kum sâwmli mi ka ni tah a; chun, ka lungrila um ang chie chu a kuoma khan kân tlun nâwk a."
8,Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.,"Amiruokchu, ka unau kei le fe vehai khan mipuihai lungril an suk- tuipêk a, kei ruok chun chu LALPA ka Pathien chu titakzetin ka zui tlat a."
9,"And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God.","Chuongchun, chu ni chun Mosien, ‘LALPA ka Pathien hi titakzeta i zui tlat leiin i kein a lo sir ta ram chu kumkhuoin nangma le i thlahai rochan ding ni ngei ngei a tih,’ tiin ṭawng ân khâm a."
10,"And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.","Ngai ta, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- a chuong thuhai chu a hrila inthawk Israelhai thlalêra an invâk an invâk sûng po po, kum sâwmli panga zet chu a lo hril ta angin LALPA chun a mîn damtir tah a; chuongchun, ngai ta, tuhin kum sâwmriet panga ka lo ni tah a."
11,"As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.","Chuong sa khawm chun tu chen hin Mosien a mi tir lai ang el khan ka la hrât zing a, inhmaa indona ding le suok invâkna dinga thahrui ka nei ang khan tu khawm hin ka la nei zing i sawnnaw."
12,"Now therefore give me this hill-country, whereof Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Jehovah spake.","Chuongchun, hi tlâng LALPAIN kha nia a lo hril ta kha mi pe el ta la, khânga Anakim mihai an um a, an khawpuihai khawm a ropuiin kula inhuon khup a nih ti kha nia khan i hriet kha, LALPA chun mi umpuiin, anni chu ka hnawt suok thei rawi mawh, LALPAIN a lo hril ta ang khan,” a ta."
13,And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.,"Chuongchun, Josua chun ama chu mal a sâwm a; Jephunne naupa Kaleb chu a rochan dingin Hebron chu a pêk tah a."
14,"Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chuleiin, Hebron chu tu chen hin Keniz mi, Jephunne naupa Kaleb rochan a hung ni tah a nih, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu titakzeta a zui tlat leiin."
15,Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.,"Hebron khuo hming chu a hma chun Kiriath-arba a na, Arba chu Anakim mihai laia mi lientak a nih. Chuongchun, ram chu râlmuongin a um hri taphawt a."
