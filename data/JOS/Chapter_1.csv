2,"Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.","“Ka siehlaw Mosie chu a thi tah a; tho la, nang le hieng mipui po pohai le hin Jordan hi kân unla, anni Israel thlahai ngei ka ipêk rama chun fe ro."

7,"Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.","Ka siehlaw Mosiein dân po po zâwm dinga a pêk che kha zâwm tlat dingin hrâttak le huoitakin um phawt el rawh. I fena taphawta i tluongtlung peina dingin i changtieng amanih, i vawitieng amaniha khawm pêtsan dêr naw rawh."
8,"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.","Hi dân bu hin i bâu chu suoksan hlek naw sienla, chu thu ziekhai po po chu i zâwm tlat theina dingin sûn le zânin i ngaituo ding a nih, chuong- chun, i lampuihai chu suktluong pei i ta; i hung tluongtlung pei ding a nih. Thu ka pêk che a ni naw am a nih?"
9,"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.","Hrâttak le huoitakin um rawh; ṭi naw la, zâm bawk naw rawh, LALPA i Pathien chu i fena taphawtah i kuomah a um pei ding annâwm,” tiin, a hril a."
10,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,","Chuongchun, Josua chun mipui hotuhai chu thu a pêk a,"
11,"Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.","“Riebûk chu va fang unla, mi- puihai kuoma chun, ‘Fâk dinghai buot- sai ro khai, ni thum sûngin LALPA in Pathienin ram hluo ding a pêk cheu hi hluo dingin Jordan vadung hi in kân ding a nih,’ tiin thu pe ro,” tiin."

13,"Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land.","“LALPA in Pathienin châwlna a pêk cheu a, hi ram hi a la pêk ding cheu a nih, tia LALPA siehlaw Mosien thu a pêk cheu hi hre zing unla."
14,"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;","In nuhmeihai, in nau le tehai le in ran ruolhai hi chu Jordan râla Mosien ram a lo pêka cheu chun um an ta; nangni mi hrât huoihai po chu inrâlthuomin lo kai hmasâng in ta, in unauhai lo ṭhangpui in ta;"
15,"until Jehovah have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.","LALPAIN in unauhai khawm chu nangni ang bawka châwlna a pêka, LALPA in Pathienin ram a pêk chu anni khawma an hluo ve hma- khat chun; chuongchun, LALPA sie- hlaw Mosien Jordan râl, nisa suokna tieng ram in puola a lo pêk ta cheu tieng chun kîr nâwk in ta, in la hluo ding a nih,” tiin, a hril a."

17,"According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Jehovah thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.","Kawng iengkima Mosie thu kan zâwm pei hlak ang khan, i thu khawm zâwm pei kan tih. LALPA i Pathien chu Mosie kuoma a um hlak ang khan i kuoma hin um ve phawt sienla."
18,"Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of good courage.","Tukhawm i thupêk chunga hela, thu i pêk taphawt zâwm nuom lo chu sukhlum ding nîng an tih, hrâttak le huoitakin um phawt el rawh,” tiin."
