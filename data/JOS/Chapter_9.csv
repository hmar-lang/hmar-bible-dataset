1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;","Chun, Jordan vadung râla lalhai po po tlânga mi le phaia mi dâm, tuisuoriet lientak vatluona Lebanon chena um po po Hit mihai, Amor mihai, Kanaan mihai, Periz mihai, Hiv mihai, Jebus mihai chun an lo hriet chun,"
2,"that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.",Josua le Israelhai chu inthuruola thawhrawn tumin an pungkhâwm tah a.
3,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,","Nisienlakhawm, Gibeon khuoa umhai chun Josuain Jeriko khuo le Ai khuo a thaw dân an lo hriet chun,"
4,"they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,","var vervêkin an châng ve ta thung a, palai angin an insiem a, ip hluitak tak an sabengtunghai an inphurtir a, uoin peng hluitak tak, a ṭiek tahai leh,"
5,"and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy.","kekawk hluitak tak, inphâwk ṭêt ṭût hi an bun a, puon hluitak tak an sil a, an fâk dinga an hung chawi beihai chu ṭâwl ṭekṭuk le ap bur el dâm hi a na."
6,"And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.","Chun, Josua kuomah Gilgala an riebûka chun an va feh a, a kuoma le Israelhai kuoma chun, “Ram hlataka inthawka hung kan na; chuongchun, kan kuoma hin thu thlung ro khai,” an va tih a."
7,"And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?","Israelhai ruok chun Hiv mihai kuoma chun, “Keini laia chêng ve hi in lo ni zing el rawi maw; iengtin am in kuomah thu thlung el thei kan ta?” an tih a."
8,"And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?","Anni chun Josua kuoma chun, “I siehlawhai kan ni hi,” an ta. Josua chun an kuomah, “Tuhai am in ni leh? Khâwtienga inthawka hung am in ni leh?” a tih a."
9,"And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,","Anni chun a kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien hming leiin i siehlawhai hi ram hlataka inthawka hung kan nih, a hming inthangzie dâm, Aiguptaa a thilthaw po po dâm,"
10,"and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.","Jordan vadung râla Amor mihai lal pahnihai Hesbon ram lal Sihon hai dâm, Basan ram lal Astaroth khuoa um Og hai dâm chunga a thilthaw po pohai kha kan hriet sih a."
11,"And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us.","Chun, kan upahai le kan rama chênghai po po chun kan kuomah, ‘Lampuia dingin fâk dinghai chawiin anni va be ro khai; chun, an kuomah, in siehlawhai kan ni hi, kan kuomah thu thlung ro khai ti unla,’ tiin an hril a."
12,"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:","Hieng kan fâk dinga kan beihai hi in kuoma hung dinga kan hung suok niin kan ina inthawka a luma kan hung chawi an na, nisienla- khawm, tuhin chu en hman ta u, a ṭâwl ṭuk tah a, a ap bur ta hi."
13,"and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.","Hieng uoin peng kan thunnahai khawm hi a thar an na, en hman ta u, an inek vawng ta hi. Hieng kan puonhai le kan kekawkhai khawm hi kan hungna a hla khawp a, an hlui vawng ta hi,” an ta."
14,"And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.","Israel mihai chun an fâk ding hung chawi chu an lâk a, LALPA bâua thurâwn hrim an indawn nawh a."
15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.","Chuongchun, Josua chun anni le chun inremna a siem a, anni chu hlâ dingin an inkârah thuthlung a siem tah a, chun, a pungkhâwmhai laia mi lienhai khawm chun an kuomah ṭawng an inkhâm tah a."
16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.","Chun, an kuoma thu an thlung china inthawka ni thuma chun an khaw kâwlhnai, anni laia lo um ve zing hlakhai an nih ti an hriet suok tah a."
17,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.","Chun, Israel thlahai chu an fe pei a, ni thum ni chun an khawpuihai chu an va tlung a. An khawpuihai chu Gibeon dâm, Kephira dâm, Beeroth dâm, Kiriath-Jearim dâm an nih."
18,"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.","Pungkhâwmhai mi lienhai chun LALPA Israelhai Pathien sâla ṭawng an lo inkhâm ta leiin, Israel thlahai chun anni an tâwk nawh a. Chuong- chun, pungkhâwmhai po po chu mi lienhai chunga chun an chier a."
19,"But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.","Nisienlakhawm, mi lienhai po po chun pungkhâwmhai po po kuoma chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien sâlin an kuomah ṭawng kan lo inkhâm ta sih a; chuleiin, anni chu tuhin ei tâwk a thieng naw a nih."
20,"This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.","Hieng ang hin an chungah thâwng ei ta, hla el ei tiu, chuong naw chun an kuoma ṭawng kan lo inkhâm ta leiin ei chunga hin lunginsenna hung tlung el a tih,” an tih a."
21,"And the princes said unto them, Let them live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them.","Chun, mi lienhai ma chun an kuomah, “Hlain um el raw hai se,” an tih a. Chuongchun, pungkhâwmhai po po thing inkhâwmtua le tui chawi- tuah an hung um tah a, mi lienhaiin an hril ang chun."
22,"And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?","Josua chun anni chu ân kotir a, an kuomah, “Iengdinga, ‘Ram hla- taka inthawka hung kan nih,’ tia in mi hlêm el am? Keini laia chêng ve in lo ni zing el sih a."
23,"Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.","Chuleiin, ṭawngsephur in hung ni a ni ta hi, ieng lai khawmin nangni laia mi ṭhenkhat hi suok ni zing an ta, kan Pathien ta dinga thing inkhâwm- tua le tui chawituah um zing an tih,” tiin a hril a."
24,"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.","Anni chun Josua chu an dawn a, “LALPA i Pathien a siehlaw Mosie khan ram pumpui hi pe cheua in hmaa a ram hluotu um po pohai hi sukbohmang pei ding a nih ti thu a lo pêk kha i siehlawhai hi an lo hril chieng êm a; chuleiin, nangni leiin kan hringna hi chân kan inlau êm a, hieng ang hin kan lo thaw el a nih."
25,"And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.","Tuhin, ngai ta, i kuta um kan na, i ngaia ṭha le indika i hriet ang ang chun kan chunga hin thaw pei el rawh,” an tih a."
26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.","Chuongchun, an chunga chun chuong ang chun a thaw tah a, Israel thlahaia inthawk chun a sansuok a, anni chu an that ta nawh a."
27,"And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Jehovah, unto this day, in the place which he should choose.",Josua chun chu ni chun LALPA- IN hmun a ruotna taphawtah pung- khâwmhai le LALPA mâichâm ta dinga tulai chena thing inkhâwmtua le tui chawituah a ruot a.
