1,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;","LALPA chun Josua kuomah, “Ṭi naw la, zâm bawk naw rawh, râlkâp mi po po i kuomah ṭhuoi la, tho la, Ai khuoah hang fe rawh; ngai ta, Ai khaw lal le, a mihai le, a khuo le a ram chu i kutah ka pêk tah."
2,"and thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it.","Jeriko le an lal chunga i thaw ang khan Ai khuo le a lal chunga khawm thâwng i ta, râllâk le ranhai chau chu nangni chan dingin lâng in tih. Khawpui inchânru ding a hnung tiengah sie bawk rawh,” a tih a."
3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.","Chuongchun, Josua le râl kâp mi po po chu Ai khuo tienga hang fe ding chun an inthawk tah a; Josua chun mi hrât huoisen sîng thum a thlang suok a, zânah ân fetir a."
4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:","Anni chu thu a pêk a, “Ngai ta u, khawpui hnungtienga chun khawpui chu thaw dingin inchânru unla, khawpuia inthawka hlatakah fe naw unla, inzosa zingin um phawt el ro."
5,"and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;","Kei le keia kuoma umhai po po chun khawpui chu hung hnai kan ta; inhma ang bawka eini mi thaw dinga an hung suok phaleh, an hmaah tlânsieng kan ta."
6,"and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;","Chuongchun, mi hung hnawt dingin hung suok an ta, khuoa inthawka hla rei chen kan zâwr suok chenin; anni chun, ‘Inhma ang bawk khan ei hmaah an tlansie nâwk tah,’ an ti ding a nih. Chuongchun, an hmaah tlânsieng kan tih."
7,"and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.","Chun, inchânrûknaa inthawk chun hung suok in ta, khawpui chu la el in tih; LALPA in Pathienin in kutah a pêk ding a nih."
8,"And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.","Khawpui chu in lâk phingleh, khawpui chu raw el ro, LALPA thu ang peiin in thaw ding a nih; ngai ta u, thu ka pêk ta cheu hi,” tiin."
9,"And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.","Chun, Josua chun ân fetir tah a, inchânrûkna hmuna chun an feh a. Ai khuo thlangtienga Bethel le Ai khuo inkâra chun an um a, Josua ruok chu, chu zân chun mipuihai lai a riek a."
10,"And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.","Chun, Josua chu zîngkâr in- hmatakin a tho a, mipuihai chu a kei khâwm a; chun, ama le Israel upahai chu mipuihai hmaa chun Ai khuo tieng an hang feh a."
11,"And all the people, even the men of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.","A kuoma râl kâp mi umhai po po chu an hang feh a, khawpui bul chen chu an hang feh a, Ai khuo hmârtieng panga chun an riek a; Ai khuo le an inkâra chun ruom a um a."
12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.","Chun, mi sâng nga lai a ṭhuoi a, khawpui thlangtieng pang Bethel le Ai khuo inkâra chun ân chânrûktir a."
13,"So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.","Chuongchun, mipui khawpui hmârtieng panga sipaihai ṭhang- hmun le, khawpui thlangtieng panga inchânrutuhai ṭhanghmun chu an hang ruot fel a; Josua chu chu zân chun ruom laitaka chun a riek a."
14,"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.","Chun, Ai khuo lal chun chu chu a hmu phingleh, inhmâwtakin chu tûk chun, chu khuoa mihai, ama le a rawihai po po chu an tho a, a hmun ruot Araba zâwnah Israelhai chu thaw dingin an hung suok tah a; nisienlakhawm, khuo hnungtieng chun ama thaw dingin an inchânrûk ti a hriet nawh a."
15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.","Josua le Israel mihai po po chu tlâwm ni âwmtakin an um a, thlalêr tienga lampuia chun an tlân tah a."
16,"And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.","Chun, khawpuia mi umhai po po chu anni hnawt dingin an ko khâwm a, chuongchun, Josua chu an hnawt a, khawpuia inthawk chun hla rei chu zâwr suokin an um tah a."
17,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.","Ai khuo le Bethel khuoa chun Israelhai hnawt lo chu pakhat bek khawm an um ta nawh a; khawpui chu khâr loin an mâksan el tah a, Israelhai chu an hnawt tah a."
18,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuom- ah, “Fei i kuta um kha Ai khuo tieng nghain inlet rawh, i kutah ka pêk ding a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Josua chun a kuta fei chu khawpui tieng ngha chun a hang inlet tah a."
19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.","Chun, ân chânrutuhai kha an umna hmuna inthawk chun an hung suok vat a; a kut chu a hang phar phingleh an tlân a, khawpuia chun an lût a, an lâk tah a; khuo chu an raw tah a."
20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.","Chuongchun, Ai mihai chun an hnungtieng an hei thlîr chun, khaw- pui khu vântienga tung ngut ngut el chu an hmu tah a, khawtieng tienga khawm tlân theina hrim hrim an nei ta nawh a; chuongchun, thlalêra tlânhai khan anni hnawttuhai chu an hung lenghat ve ta thung a."
21,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.","Chun, Josua le Israelhai po po chun inchânrutuhaiin khawpui an lâk, khawpui khu chu ân tung ngut ngut an hei hmu chun an hung kîr a, Ai mihai chu an that tah a."
22,"And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.","Chun, mi danghai chu a thaw dingin khaw sûnga inthawk chun an hung suok a; chuongchun, Israelhai chun ruongchaiche an thlâk tah a; a ṭhen khingtieng an um a, a ṭhen khingtieng an um bawk a; chuong- chun, an that a, pakhat khawm hla le insuo hrim hrim an nei nawh a."
23,"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.","Ai khuo lal ruok chu a hringin an man a, Josua kuomah an ṭhuoi a."
24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.","Israel mihai chun Ai khuoa mi phûla umhai po po chu thlalêr rama anni an va hnawtna hmunah an that zo a, an rênga kâwlhnâma an that rêm dêr hnung chun, Israel mihai po po chu Ai khuo tieng chun an kîr nâwk a, kâwlhnâmin an that tah a."
25,"And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.","Chu nia thihai po po chu nuhmei le pasal mi sîng khat le sâng hni an nih, Ai khuoa mihai po po chu."
26,"For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.",Josua chun a fei inletna kut chu Ai mihai po po a sukbohmang vawng hmakhat chun a kei thlâk nawh a.
27,"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.","LALPAIN Josua thu a pêk a, thaw ding a ti ang ngei khan chu khawpuia ranhai le râllâkhai chau chu Israelhai chun anni chanpuolah an nei a."
28,"So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.","Chuongchun, Josua chun Ai khuo chu a rawh a, kumkhuoa dingin hnuoi pâwngah a siem a, tu chen hin râusan a lo ni tah a nih."
29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.","Chun, Ai khuo lal chu zântieng chenin thinglêrah a khai a; nisa tlâka chun Josuain thu a pêk a; chuong- chun, a ruong chu thinglêra inthawk chun an lâk thlâk a, khawpui dâi kawtkhâr lûtnaah an pei a, a chungah lung an dêng vûm thûr a, chu chu tu chen hin a la um."
30,"Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,","Josua chun Ebal tlângah LALPA, Israelhai Pathien ta dingin mâichâm a siem a;"
31,"as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings.","Mosie dân lekhabua ziek ta anga, LALPA siehlaw Mosien Israel thlahai chu a lo pêk ta ang khan; chu mâichâm chu lung sut lo, tukhawma a chunga thîr an lân let ngailo a na; chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai an in- hlân a, inremna thilinhlânhaiin an inthâwi a."
32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.","Chun, chutaka chun Israel thlahai hma ngeia Mosien dân a ziek kha lungahai chun a zieksâwng a,"
33,"And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the home-born; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.","Chun, Israelhai po po, an upa- hai le hotuhai, an rorêltuhai leh, Levi chi thiempuhai, LALPA thuthlungna bâwm zâwntuhai hmaah, bâwm khingtieng khingtieng panga chun hnam danghai le, chu rama pienghai khawm chu an ngîr hmunkhat seng a. A zâtve chu Gerizim tlâng pangah an um a, a zâtve chu Ebal tlâng pangah an um a, LALPA siehlaw Mosiein Israelhai chu mal a sâwmpêk ding a nih tia thu a lo pêk tah ang khan."
34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.","Chun, chu hnunga chun dân thu po po, malsâwmna thu le ṭawngse- phurna thu chu a tiem a, dân lekha- bua chuong ang po po el kha."
35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners that were among them.",Mosie thupêk ang po po chu Israel pungkhâwm po pohai le nu- hmeihai le naupang chite tehai le anni laia hnam dang chêng vehai hrieta chun Josua chun tiem ṭhel hrim hrim a nei nawh.
