1,"And this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.","Chun, Manasse thlahai chan- puol chu hieng hi a nih; ama chu Josef nau lutîr kha a na. Gilead pa, Manasse nau lutîr Makir ruok chu indo mi a na, Gilead le Basan ram chu a chang a."
2,"So the lot was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.","Chun, chanpuol chu Manasse thlahai dang po po, an sûngkuo izir ang peiin, Abiezer thlahai, Helek thlahai, Asriel thlahai, Sekem thla- hai, Hepher thlahai le Semida thlahai ta ding dâmin pêk a nih; chuonghai chu an sûngkuo izir ang peia Josef naupa Manasse thla pasalhai chu an nih."
3,"But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.","Manasse naupa Makir, chu naupa Gilead, chu naupa Hepher, chu naupa Zelophehad ruok chun nau- pasal nei loin naunuhmei ruok a nei a; chuong a naunuhmeihai hming chu: Mahla, Noa, Hogla, Milka le Tirza an nih."
4,"And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.","Chun, thiempu Eleazar le Nun naupa Josua le mi lienhai hmaah an fe veh a, “Kan unaupahai laia hin chanpuol mi pe ve dingin LALPAIN Mosie kha thu a pêk a nih,” tiin an hril a, chuongchun, LALPA thupêk angin an pa unauhai laia chun chan- puol a pêk ve tah a."
5,"And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;","Chuongchun, Jordan râla Gilead le Basan ram tiem loin Manasse chanpuolah hmun sâwm a tluh a;"
6,because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh.,Manasse naunuhmeihai chun a naupasalhai laia chun chanpuol an nei ve lei a nih. Gilead ram chu Manasse naupasal danghai chun an chang a.
7,"And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.","Chun, Manasse ramri chu Sekem saktienga um Asera inthawka Mik- methath chenin a nih; ramri chu simtieng panga chun En-tappua mihai umna chenin a feh a."
8,The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.,"Tappua ram chu Manasse ta a na, Manasse ramri depa Tappua ruok kha chu Ephraim thlahai ta a nih."
9,"And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:","Chun, ramri chu Kana vadung- teah, vadungte simtieng panga chun a fe thlah a, chuong khawpuihai chu Manasse khawpuihai laia, Ephraim ta a nih. Manasse ramri chu vadung- te hmârtieng panga chun a nih; chun, tuisuorietah a fe thlah a."
10,"southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.","Simtieng pang chu Ephraim ta a na, hmârtieng pang chu Manasse ta a na, tuisuoriet chu a ramri a nih, hmârtienga chun Aser chenin a va nih a, saktienga chun Issakar chenin a hang nih."
11,"And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.","Issakar le Aser rama chun Manasse chun Beth-sean le a sîrvêl khuohai, Ibleam le a sîrvêl khuohai, Dora umhai le a sîrvêl khuohai, En-dora umhai le a sîrvêl khuohai, Taanaka umhai le a sîrvêl khuohai, Megiddoa umhai le a sîrvêl khuohai, zo khawsâng pathumhai chu a nei a."
12,Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.,"Nisienlakhawm, Manasse thla- hai chun chuong khawpuia umhai chu an hnawt suok thei nawh a, Kanaan mihai chu chuong rama chun an um tlat el a."
13,"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.","Israel thlahai chu an hung hrât deu deu phing chun, Kanaan mihai chu sinthawa hmang dingin an inumtir a, an hnawt suok fai rêt ta nawh."
14,"And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah hath blessed me?","Josef thlahai chun Josua kuom- ah, “Iengtiziea rohluo ding chanpuol pakhat le chan khat chau i mi pêk bîk am a na, LALPA hlakin mal a mi sâwm nasa a, kan tam hle sih a?” tiin an hril a."
15,"And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.","Josua chun an kuomah, “Chuonga tam in ni chun, Periz mihai le Ephraim mihai ram rampuihai khi, fe unla, in umna dingin hang vât ta unla, Ephraim tlâng ram in ta dinga a chîn taluo chun,” a tih a."
16,"And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.","Josef thlahai chun, “Tlâng ram hi kan ta dingin a hun naw a nih, phai rama Kanaan mi chênghai po po, Beth-sean le a khawpuia umhai le Jezreel ruoma umhai hin thîr taw- lailîr an nei seng sih a,” an tih a."
17,"And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:","Josua chun Josef sûnghai, Ephraim le Manasse thlahai kuoma chun, “In tam hleh a, hrât khawm in hrât a; chuongchun, chan khat chau chu nei da ti niu ie,"
18,"but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.","tlâng ram khi in ta ni el raw se, rampui khawm ni sienla, vât in ta, a ram chin po po chu in ta a ni el ding annâwm; Kanaan mihai chun thîr tawlailîrhai neiin, hrât hle hai sien khawm, in la hnawt suok ding annâwm,” tiin a hril a."
