1,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.","Josua chu zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, Shittima inthawk chun an insawn a, Jordan an va tlung a, ama le Israel thlahai po po le chun; an kai hmain chutaka chun an riek a."
2,"And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;",Ni thum chinah hotuhai chun riebûk chu an va fang pei a.
3,"and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.","“LALPA in Pathien Thuthlung bâwm le thiempu Levi mihaiin an zâwn lai in hmu pha chun in umna hmuna inthawk hin insawn unla, zui el ro."
4,"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.","Amiruokchu, nangni le chu inkâr chu inkhia tawng sâng hni amanih a ni ding a nih; hnai hlek naw ro, chuongchun, in fena ding lampui chu hre thei in ta, kha hma khan hi lampui hi in la hraw ngai si nawh a,” tiin, mipuihai chu thu a pêk a."
5,"And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for to-morrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.","Chun, Josua chun mipuihai kuomah, “Insukthieng ro, zinga hin LALPAIN nangni lai thil maktakhai a thaw ding a nih,” a ta."
6,"And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.","Chun, Josua chun thiempuhai kuoma chun, “Thuthlung bâwm hi zâwn unla, mipuihai hmaah fe ro,” a ta, a hril a. Chuongchun, thuthlung bâwm chu an zâwn a, mipui hma chu an ṭhuoi tah a."
7,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “Mosie kuoma ka um ang khan, i kuoma khawm ka um ding a nih ti an hriet theina dingin, Israelhai po po mithmuah vawisûn hin ka chawi- mawi ṭan ding che a nih."
8,"And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.","Chun, thuthlung bâwm zâwntu thiempuhai chu thu pêng i ta, ‘Jordan vadung pang chu in tlung pha chun, Jordana chun ngir zing ro,’ tiin,” a ta."
9,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.","Chun Josua chun Israel thlahai kuoma chun, “Hung unla, LALPA in Pathien thuhai hi hung ngai ta u khai,” a ta."
10,"And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.","Josua chun, “Hitaka hin Pathien hring chu nangni lai a um a, in hmaa hin Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Periz mihai, Girgas mihai, Amor mihai, Jebus mihai hi a hnawt suok ngei ngei ding a nih ti hre ngei in tih."
11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan.","Ngai ta u, khawvêl pumpui Lal- pa thuthlung bâwm chun in hmaah Jordan vadung chu a kân a nih."
12,"Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.","Chuongchun, Israel hnamhai laia mi hi sâwmpahni hnam tin aiah mi pakhat pei thlang suok unla,"
13,"And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap.","chun, LALPA hnuoi pumpui Lalpa bâwm zâwntu thiempuhai ke chun Jordan tui a sir charin Jordan tui, saktienga inthawka tui hung luonghai chu suktan nîng a ta; chuongchun, hlawm khatin ngîr an tih,” a ta."
14,"And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people;","Mipuihai chu Jordan vadung kai dinga an puon inhaia inthawka an suok chun, thuthlung bâwm zâwn- tu thiempuhai chu mipui hmaa chun an feh a, bâwm zâwntuhai chu Jordan an va tlung a,"
15,"and when they that bare the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest),","bâwm zâwntu thiempuhai ke chun vapang tui a hang sir phingleh (bu sîk sûng po hin chu Jordan vadung hi a kuong po po a liem zing hlak a),"
16,"that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.","saktienga inthawka tui hung luong thla lai chu a ngîr tah a, hla reiah, Zarethan ram bula Adam khuoa chun a lo inhlawm ngîr ûr el tah a; chun, Araba tuisuoriet, Tui- suoriet Al chu, chu tienga luong lûthai khawm chu suktan vawng an ni tah a; chuongchun, mipuihai chu Jeriko khuo zawn taka chun an kai tah a."
17,"And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan.","Chun, LALPA thuthlung bâwm zâwntu thiempuhai chu Jordan vadung laia chun, hnuoi hulah an ngîr zing tah a; mipui po po chun Jordan vadung chu an kai fai vawng chenin Israelhai po po chu hnuoi hula chun an fe kai ta vawng a."
