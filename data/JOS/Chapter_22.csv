1,"Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,","Chuongchun, Josua chun, Reuben mihai, Gad mihai le Manasse hnam zâtve hai chu a ko a,"
2,"and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have hearkened unto my voice in all that I commanded you:","an kuomah, “LALPA siehlaw Mosien thu a pêk taphawt cheu chu in pawm pei a, thu keiin ka pêk taphawt cheu khawm in pawm pei hlak a,"
3,"ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.","hi chen hin, vawisûn ni chen hin in unauhai chu in thlathlam nawh a, LALPA in Pathienin thaw dinga thu a pêkhai cheu chu in zâwm hlak a."
4,"And now Jehovah your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he spake unto them: therefore now turn ye, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.","Chuongchun, LALPA in Pathien- in an kuoma a lo hril ta ang khan in unauhai hi tuhin muongna a pêk ta hi: chuleiin, LALPA siehlaw Mosien Jordan râla in chanpuol dinga ram a lo pêk ta cheua khan, in puon in tienga chun fe nâwk ta ro."
5,"Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.","LALPA siehlaw Mosien LALPA in Pathien chu hmangai a, a lampuihai po po chu hrawh a, a thupêkhai chu pawm a, ama chu chel tlat a, in lungril po po le thlarau po poa a rawngbâwl tlat dinga thu a pêk cheu kha; chu thupêk le dân dâm chu fîmkhurtakin vawng ṭhat tum phawt el unla,” a ta."
6,"So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went unto their tents.","Chuongchun, Josua chun anni chu mal a sâwm a, ân fetir tah a; chuongchun, an puon inhai tieng chun an fe tah a."
7,"Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but unto the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them,","Tun Manasse hnam zâtvehai kha Mosie chun Basan ramah chanpuol a pêk a; a zâtve danghai ruok kha chu Josua chun thlang tienga Jordan râla an unauhai lai chanpuol a pêk lem a. Josua chun an in tienga ân fetir ding lai khan mal a sâwm a,"
8,"and spake unto them, saying, Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.","an kuomah, “In puon inhai tieng chun hausatakin fe ta unla, ran tamtak leh, tangka dâm, rângka- chak le dâm, dâr le dâm, thîr le dâm, silfên tamtakhai le dâm, in hmêl- mahaia inthawka in râllâkhai kha in unauhai leh insem seng ro,” tiin a hril a."
9,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.","Chun, Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai le Manasse thla zâtvehai chu an kîr nâwk tah a. Kanaan ram Silo khuoa Israel thlahai kuoma inthawk chun Gilead ram, LALPAIN Mosie hmanga thu a lo pêk ta ang khan an chanpuol hrima lo ruotsa tah, chu rama fe ding chun an suok tah a."
10,"And when they came unto the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon.","Chun, Kanaan ram Jordan biel an va tlung chun Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai le Manasse hnam zâtvehai chun Jordan vadung panga chun mâichâm lientak el langsârtak hi an siem a."
11,"And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel.","Chun, Israel thlahai chun, “Ngai ta u, Reuben thlahai le, Gad thlahai le Manasse hnam zâtvehai khan Kanaan ram bultak Jordan biel, Israel thlahai ram tieng pangah mâichâm an siem a,” tia mî hril an hriet a."
12,"And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.","Chun, chu chu Israel thlahai chun an lo hrietin Israel thla mipui po po chu anni hang do ding chun Silo khuoa chun an inkhâwm tah a."
13,"And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,","Chun, Israel thlahai chun Gilead rama Reuben thlahai le, Gad thlahai le Manasse hnam zâtvehai kuoma chun Thiempu Eleazar naupa Phinehas an tir a;"
14,"and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel.","ama le chun mi lien sâwm, Israelhai hnam laia sûngkuo lusa tak pakhat pei leh. Chuonghai chu Israel hnamhai laia an sûngkuo lusa takhai pei an nih."
15,"And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,","Chun, Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai le Manasse hnam zâtvehai kuoma chun Gilead ramah an hang fe tah a,"
16,"Thus saith the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah?","an kuomah, “LALPA mipuihai po poin, ‘Israelhai Pathien chungah iengtidâna bawseh a, LALPA zuinaa chun pêthmang am in na?"
17,"Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,","Peor hmuna bawsietnahai kha ei ta dinga chîn taluoa ngai thei am a nih? Tu chen khawm hin khâng ei suolhai kha ei lân silfai zo naw a na, kha lei khan LALPA mipuihai chunga khan hri kha ân lêng a na,"
18,"that ye must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against Jehovah, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.",vawisûn hin LALPA chu nghat- san in tum el ding maw? Hienga vawisûn hin LALPA chunga in hel el chun zinga chun Israel mipui po po chungah a lunginsen ngei ding a nih.
19,"Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein Jehovah’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.","Amiruokchu, in ram hluo hi ân thieng naw a ni chun, LALPA ram sûng, LALPA biekbûk umna hmunah hung ve el unla, keini lai um ve el ta unla; amiruokchu, LALPA kan Pathien mâichâm ti naw chu, mâi- châm dang siem chun chu LALPA chungah hel naw ro; chun, kan chunga khawm hel naw ta unla."
20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.","Zera naupa Akan khan thil pumpêka khan thil a suksuol a, Israel mipui po po chunga khan lungin- senna a tla a ni naw am a ni kha? Ama kha ama bawsietnaa khan ama chau ringawt a bohmang el bik naw kha,’ an ti a nih ie,” an tih a."
21,"Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,","Chuongchun, Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai le Manasse hnam zât- vehai chun Israelhai hnam puipa chu an dawn a,"
22,"The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (save thou us not this day),","an kuomah, “LALPA, pathien- hai Pathien, LALPA, pathienhai Pathien chun a hriet a; Israelhai khawmin hre raw se! Kan mâichâm siem hi LALPA nghatsan tuma hel tumna amanih, thil suksuol tumnaa mania siem kan ni chun, (vawisûn ngei khawm hin mi hla naw el ro)"
23,"that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it;","pumrawhmang thilinhlânna dingin amanih, fâk ding thilinhlânna dingin amanih, inremnaa thilinhlân- na dingin amanih a ni chun ama LALPA ngeiin hung ngaituo raw se."
24,"and if we have not rather out of carefulness done this, and of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?","Nakie pha chun in thlahaiin kan thlahai kuomah, ‘LALPA Israel- hai Pathien hi nangnîn ieng am in hmang phâk vena a um lie?"
25,"for Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah.","Nangni Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai, LALPAIN keini le nangni ta dingin Jordan hi ramri dingin a siem in sawnnaw, LALPAA hin chanpuol in nei ve hlak lem,’ hung ti hlau rawi an tih tia, fimkhurna leia thaw san nei taka thaw kan nih in sawnnaw, in thlahaiin kan thlahai chu LALPA ṭina châng hre loin an la siem el thei in sawnnaw."
26,"Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:","Chuleiin, ‘Hung ta u, mâichâm siem ei tiu, pumrawhmang thilin- hlânna ding le inthâwina ding ruok chu ni loin,"
27,"but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.","keini le nangni le ei hnunga ei thlahai kâra hrietna ding nîng a ta, chuongchun, kan pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai, kan inthâwina dâm le, kan inremna thilinhlânhai hin LALPA rawng kan bâwl theina dingin a nih; chuong naw chun in thlahai khawmin nakie tieng kan thlahai kuoma chun LALPAAH chanpuol in nei ve nawh ie, hung ti rawi an tih,’ kan ti a nih."
28,"Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.","Chu nawa khawm, nakie pha kan kuoma manih, kan thlahai kuoma manih chuong anga an la hung ti pha leh keinin, ‘En ta unla, kan thlatuhaiin LALPA mâichâm umdân an siem hi pumrawhmang thilinhlânna ding le, inthâwina ding a ni nawh a, keini le nangni kâra hrietna a ni lem, kan la tina dingin,’ kan ti a nih."
29,"Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.","LALPA chunga chu helin vawi- sûn hin LALPA nghatsana, LALPA ei Pathien a biekbûk bula mâichâm ngawt naw hi pumrawhmang thilinhlânna- in amanih, fâk mi thilinhlânna ding- in amanih, inthâwina amaniha mâi- châm siem kan ni nawzie chu,” an ta."
30,"And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them well.","Chun, thiempu Phinehas le a kuoma um mipuihai mi lien, Israel hnamhai lusahai chun Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai le Manasse thlahai thuhril an hriet chun anni a suklâwm ta hleh a."
31,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.","Chun, thiempu Eleazar naupa Phinehas chun Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai le Manasse thlahai kuoma chun, “LALPA chungah thil in suksuol naw leiin, tuhin chu LALPA chu eini lai a um ngei a nih ti ei hriet tah a nih; chuongchun, Israel thlahai hi LALPA kuta inthawkin in sansuok tah a ni hi”, an ta."
32,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.","Chuongchun, thiempu Eleazar naupa Phinehas le mi lienhai chu Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai kuoma inthawk chun Gilead rama inthawk chu Kanaan ram tienga Israel thlahai kuom tienga chun an kîr nâwk a, thu chu an vân tlun nâwk tah a."
33,"And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spake no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.","Chuong thu chun Israel thlahai chu a suklâwm hleh a; chun, Israel thlahai chun Pathien chu an inpâk tah a; chuongchun, Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai chu hang do a, an umna ram hang suksietpêk thu chu an hril nâwk ta nawh a."
34,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: For, said they, it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.","Chun, Reuben thlahai le Gad thlahai chun chu mâichâm chu Ed an inbûk a, “LALPA chu Pathien a lo ni ngei ti ei kâra hin hrietpuitu a ni leiin”, an ta."
