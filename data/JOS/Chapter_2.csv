1,"And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.","Chun, Nun naupa Josua chun, Shittima inthawk chun mi pahni inrûkin enthlatu dingin a tir a, “A ram le Jeriko khuo dâm chu va en vêl ta u,” tiin. Chun, an va feh a, naw- chizawr pakhat a hming Rahab inah an va lût a, chutaka chun an tlung tah a."
2,"And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.","“Ngai ta, vawizân hin ram enthla dingin Israel thlahai an hung a,” tiin Jeriko khuo lal chu an hril a."
3,"And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.","Jeriko khuo lal chun, “I ina hung tlung mikhuolhai kha hung ṭhuoi suok rawh, ram pumpui enthla dinga hung an ni sih a,” tiha hril dingin Rahab kuomah mi a tir a."
4,"And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were:","Nuhmei chun mi pahnihai chu a ṭhuoi a, a thuphmang tah a; “Anih, mihai chu ka kuoma chu an hung ngei a, amiruokchu, khâwtaka inthawka hung am an ni ruok chu ka hriet nawh;"
5,"and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.","khaw inthim, kul kawtkhâr khâr hun ding lai vêl khan anni chu an suok nâwk tah a, khâwtieng am an fe tah ti khawm ka hriet nawh; hnawt vat unla, hnawt phâk in tih ie,” a ta."
6,"But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.","Diktak chun in chungah a ṭhuoi a, in chunga a ziza kûng intieng khâwm lai chun a thuphmang a nih."
7,"And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.","Chun, mihai chun Jordan vadung tieng chun kai chen chun an va hnawt tah a; chun, a hnawttuhai chu an suok phing le chun dai kawtkhâr chu an khâr tah a."
8,"And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;","An zâl hma chun in chunga chun an kuomah a hang feh a,"
9,"and she said unto the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.","chu mihai kuoma chun, “Hi ram hi LALPAIN a pêk ta cheu a, in ṭitumna hin a mi del tâwl tah a, hi rama chênghai po po hi in hmaa hin an intui zo tah a ni ti ka hriet a."
10,"For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.","Aigupta rama inthawka in hung suok khan LALPAIN Tuipui Sen kha a sukkangpêk cheu a, Jordan râla Amor mihai lalhai pahni Sihon le Og chunga in thawzie kha, khânga in sukbohmang tâk elzie kha kan lo hriet sih a."
11,"And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.","Chu chu kan lo hriet phingleh kan lungrilhai chu ântui zo a, nangni lei hin, mi tukhawm lungril mumal put hrim hrim hi an um nawh a, LALPA in Pathien chu chungtieng vâna le hnuoitieng hnuoiah Pathien a ni sih a."
12,"Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token;","Chuleiin, tuhin ka ngên cheu a nih, hi in chungah ka lunginsietzie cheu ka lo suklang tah a, nangni khawma ka pa sûnghai chungah in lunginsietna chu hung inlangtir ve ding le inchikna fietak mi siempêk dingin LALPA hming sâlin mîn khâmpêk ro:"
13,"and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.","ka nu le ka pa le ka unaupahai le ka unaunuhai le an neihai po po leh, thinaa inthawkin kan hringna chu sansuok ngei dingin,” a ta."
14,"And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.","Mihai chun amanu kuoma chun, “Kan thilthaw hi i hril suok naw ding chun in thi ai thîng kan tih. LALPAIN ram hi a mi pêk pha chun lunginsiet chein, i chungah ringum- takin thâwng kan tih,” an ta."
15,"Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.","Chuongchun, tukvera chun hruihruolin a thlâk thla tah a; a in chu khawpui kul tlânga um a ni sih a, kul chunga chun a um a nih."
16,"And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “Tlâng tieng panin fe ro khai, chuong naw chun, a hnawttuhai cheu khan hmu hlau rawi an ti cheu; chutaka chun ni thum vân bihmang unla, a hung hnawttuhai cheu kha an kîr nâwk hmakhat chun: chu zoa chun fe chau ro,” a ta."
17,"And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.","Mihai chun a kuomah, “I ṭawng mîn khâmtir ringawt el hin chu thiemnaw mîn changtir el thei naw nih."
18,"Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household.","Ngai rawh, hi rama kan hung lût phaleh, hi pat sen hi i mi thlâkna tukvera hin lo khitde la; chun, in sûngah i kuomah i nu hai, i pa hai, i unaupahai, i pa sûnghai po po chu ṭhuoi lût vawng bawk rawh aw."
19,"And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.","Tukhawm i kawtkhâra in- thawka khawlaia suok taphawt chu ama lu chungah a thisen chu um a ta, keini chu thiemnaw changin um naw nîng ungah; chun, tukhawm in sûnga i kuoma um taphawt chu miin an chungah kut an thlâk chun kan lu chungah a thisen chu um a tih."
20,"But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.","Amiruokchu, kan thilthaw hi i hril suok chun ṭawng i mîn khâm- tirnaa hin thiemnaw changin um naw nîng ungah,” an ta."
21,"And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.","Chun, amanu chun, “In thu ang pei chu ni raw se chu,” a tih a. Chuongchun, anni chu ân fetir tah a, an feh a; chun, tukvera chun pat sen chu a khitdeh a."
22,"And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.","Chuongchun, an fe tah a, tlâng chu an va tlung a, anni hnawttuhai chu an kîr nâwk hmakhat chu, chu- taka chun ni thum an um a, anni hnawttuhai chun lampui intluonin an zawng a, nisienlakhawm, an hmu zo nawh a."
23,"Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.","Chuongchun, mi pahnihai chu an kîr nâwk a, tlânga inthawk chu an fe thla a, an kai a, Nun naupa Josua kuom chu an va tlung a, an chung- a thil hung tlung po po chu an hril tah a."
24,"And they said unto Joshua, Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.","Chun, Josua kuoma chun, “LALPAIN a ram pumpui chu ei kutah a lo pêk takmeu el; chu chau khawm chu a ni nawh a, chu rama chênghai po po chu eini, mi ṭiin an thi dang el a nih,” an ta."
