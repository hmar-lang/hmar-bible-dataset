1,"And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.","Chun, Josua chun Israel hnamhai po po chu Sekema chun a ko khâwm a. Israelhai upahai, an lusahai, an rorêltuhai, an hotuhai chu ân kotir a; Pathien hmaah an hung inlang tâwl a."
2,"And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.","Chun, Josua chun mi po po kuoma chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pa- thienin hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘In thlatuhai kha inhma laiin vadung khêla khan an um hlak a; Abraham pa le Nahor pa Tera meu khawm kha; anni chun pathien danghai rawng an bâwl hlak a."
3,"And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.","Chun, in thlatu Abraham kha Vadung râla inthawk khan ka ṭhuoi suok a, Kanaan ram sûng po poa khan ka ṭhuoi a, a thlahai chu ka sukpung a, Isak kha ka pêk a; chun, Isak chu Jakob le Esau ka pêk a."
4,"And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.","Chun, Esau chu a chanpuol dingin Seir tlâng ka pêk a, chun, Jakob le a nauhai kha Aiguptaah an zuk feh a."
5,"And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out.","Chun, Mosie le Aron ka tir a, Aigupta ram chu anni laia thilmak thawin ka hrem a; chu zoa chun ka ṭhuoi suok cheu a."
6,And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea.,"Chun, in thlatuhai chu Aigupta rama inthawkin ka ṭhuoi suok a; chun, tuipui in va tlung a, chuong- chun, Aigupta mihai chun in thlatu- hai chu tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai leh Tuipui Sen chenin an hnawt a."
7,"And when they cried out unto Jehovah, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.","Chun, anni chun LALPA an hang ko a, Aigupta mihai le an inkâr chu a hung sukthim ta mup a; chun, tuipui a hung intuomtir a; a chîm hmang tâwl tah a, chuongchun, Aigupta rama ka thilthaw kha in mit ngeiin in hmuh a; chun, thlalêra khan sâwttak in um a."
8,"And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.","Chun, Jordan vadung râla um Amor mihai rama chun ka ṭhuoi cheu a; an lo do cheu a; chuongchun, in kutah ka pêk a, an ram chu in hluo tah a; chun, anni chu ka sukbohmang pêk cheu a."
9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;","Chun, Moab lal Zippor naupa Balak a hung inthawk a, Israel mihai chu a lo do a, chun, Beor naupa Balaam kha ṭawngsie inphurtir ding cheuin ân kotir a,"
10,but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.,"amiruokchu, Balaam thu kha ka lo ngai nuom nawh a, chuleiin, mal a sâwm ta lem cheu a; chuongchun, a kuta inthawk chu ka sansuok ta cheu a ni kha."
11,"And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.","Chun, Jordan vadung in kai a, Jeriko in hang tlung a; chun, Jerikoa mihai chun an lo do cheu a; Amor mihai, Periz mihai, Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Girgas mihai, Hiv mihai, Jebus mihai le khan, chuongchun, anni chu in kutah ka pêk a."
12,"And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.","Chun, in hmaah khuoingal ka tir a, chu chun in hmaah anni chu a hnawt a, Amor mihai lal pahnihai ngei kha; in kâwlhnâmin amanih, in thalngulin amani khawm a ni bawk nawh."
13,"And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not labored, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.","In isuksuok dêr lo, ram le nangni isiem dêr lo khawpuihai ka pêk cheu a, chuonga chun in um a; in iphun lo grêp huona mi le oliv huona mi dâm chu in fâk a,’ tiin."
14,"Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah.","Chuleiin, LALPA chu ṭi unla, titakzet le indiktakin a rawng bâwl unla, in thlatuhaiin Vadung râl le Aiguptaa a rawng an bâwl hlak pathienhai kha pei vawng unla, LALPA rawng chu bâwl ro."
15,"And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA rawng bâwl hi ṭha awm nawa in hriet chun vawisûn hin tu rawng am a na in bâwl ding thlang el ro; in thlatuhaiin Vadung râla a rawng an bâwl hlak pathienhai kha am a ni, in ihluo ram Amor mihai pathienhai kha? Kei le ka sûnghai ruok hin chu LALPA rawng a nih kan bâwl ding chu,” a ta."
16,"And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;","Chun, mipuihai chun, “LALPA Pathien chu mâksanin pathien dang- hai rawng chu kan bâwl naw dingzie chu;"
17,"for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed;","ama LALPA kan Pathien ngeiin annâwm kan thlatuhai le Aigupta ram suoka inthawka mi ṭhuoi suok a, kan mithmua inchikna ropuitak takhai thawh a, kan fena taphawta le mipui po po kan nêr thlengnaa khawma mi humhim pei chu;"
18,"and Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve Jehovah; for he is our God.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun kan hma ngeiah hnam tin chuong rama um Amor mihai chu a hnawt suok vawng a; chuleiin, keini khawma LALPA rawng a nih kan bâwl ding chu, ama chu kan Pathien a ni sih a,” an tih a, an dawn a."
19,"And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins.","Josua ruok chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “LALPA rawng chu bâwl thei naw ti niu, ama chu Pathien inthieng a ni sih a; Pathien thîk- thusie a na, in bawsietna dâm le in suolnahai chu ngaidam naw ni."
20,"If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.","LALPA chu in mâksan a, hnam dang pathienhai rawng in bâwl chun chu, in chungah a ṭha sa hin in chung- ah thil ṭha nawin ṭuong vêng a ta, a sukbohmang el ding cheu a nih”, a ta."
21,"And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve Jehovah.","Chun, mipuihai chun Josua kuomah, “Ni lo e, LALPA rawng kan bâwl tlat lem ding a nih,” an ta."
22,"And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.","Chun, Josua chun mipuihai kuomah, “A rawng bâwl tumin LALPA chu in thlang ta ngei ti thuhretuhai chu nangni ngei hi in nih,” a ta. Chun, anni chun, “Thuhretuhai chu kan ni a ni ta hi,” an ta."
23,"Now therefore put away, said he, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chun, ama ma chun, “Chuong chu a ni chun, tûn nangni laia hnam dang pathien umhai chu sie hmang dai unla, in lungrilhai chu LALPA Israelhai Pathien tieng chun in- thlêktir ro,” a ta."
24,"And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.","Chun, mipuihai chun, Josua kuomah, “LALPA kan Pathien rawng chu bâwl kan ta, a thu chu zâwm pei kan tih”, an ta."
25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.","Chuongchun, Josua chun chu ni chun mipuihai kuomah thu a thlung a, Sekem khuoa chun dân le rorêlna a ruotpêk a."
26,"And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Josua chun chuong thu chu Pathien dân buah a ziek a, chun, lung lientak a lâk a, LALPA hmun inthieng bula thingsai- suo hnuoia chun a phun a."
27,"And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.","Chun, Josua chun mipuihai po po kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, hi lung hi ei thuhretu ni raw se, LALPAIN ei kuoma a thuhrilhai po po chu a hriet ta hi; chuleiin, in thuhretu a ni ding a nih, chuong a ni naw chun, Pathien hi inphatsan el rawi in tih,” a ta."
28,"So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.","Chuongchun, Josua chun mi- puihai chu anni chanpuol ram senga khan ân fetir tah a."
29,"And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.","Chuong thil hnunga chun Nun naupa Josua, LALPA siehlaw chu kum za le sâwm miin a thih a."
30,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.","Gaas tlâng hmârtieng pang, Ephraim tlâng rama ama chanpuol ramri sûng Timnath-seraa chun an phûm tah a."
31,"And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Jehovah, that he had wrought for Israel.","Chun, Josua dam sûng le, upahai Josua hnunga la damhai, LALPAIN Israel mihai ta dinga thil a thawhai po po hretuhai dam sûng chun, Israel mihai chun LALPA rawng an bâwl hlak a."
32,"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.","Chun, Israel thlahaiin Aigupta rama inthawka Josef ru an sawm pei kha Sekem khuoa chun Sekem pa, Hamor nauhaia inthawka Jakobin tangka zaa a în châwka khan an phûm a; chuongchun, chuong chu Josef thlahai puolah a hung um tah a."
33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill-country of Ephraim.","Chun, Aron naupa Eleazar chu a thi a, a naupa Phinehas puol dinga an pêk Ephraim tlâng rama Gibea khuoa chun an phûm tah a."
