1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.","Amiruokchu, Israel thlahai chun thil pumpêk chun thil an lo suksuol tah a. Juda hnama mi Zera naupa Zabdi, chu naupa Karmi, chu naupa Akan chun thil pumpêka mi chu a lo lâk a; chuongchun, Israel thlahai chunga chun LALPA lung a lo sen tah a."
2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.","Chun, Josua chun Jeriko khuoa inthawk chun Bethel saktieng, Beth-Aven dep Ai khuoa chun mihai a tir a, an kuomah, “Hang fe unla, ram hang enthla ta u,” tiin a hril a. Mihai chu an hang feh a, Ai khuo chu an hang enthlâk tah a."
3,"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.","Chun, Josua kuoma chun an kir nâwk a, a kuomah, “Mi po po chu hang fe kher da el raw hai se, mi sâng hni amanih, sâng thum amanih hang fe hai sienla, Ai khuo chu thaw raw se; mi po po hang suksâwl kher ding a ni nawh ie, tlâwmte chau an ni sih a,” an ta."
4,So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.,"Chuongchun, mipui laia mi chu mi sâng thum vêl chutaka chun an hang feh a; chun, Ai mihai hmaa chun an hung tlânse tah a."
5,"And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent: and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.","Ai mihai chun mi sâwmthum le paruk lai an lo that a, dai kawtkhâr bula inthawk Sebarim chen rauin an hung hnawt a, an liem thlâknaa chun an that tâwl a, chun, mihai lungril chu ân tui zo tah a, tui ang el a lo ni tah a."
6,"And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.","Josua chun a puonhai a keithlêr a, ama le Israel upahai chu LALPA bâwm hmaa chun an hmaia hnuoi sikin zântieng chenin an bawkkhup a; an luah pilvut an inphul a."
7,"And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!","Josua chun, “E khai, iengdinga, Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, keini mipuihai hi sukbohmanga um dinga Amor mihai kuta pêk dinga Jordan vadung hi mi ṭhuoi kai am i na? Jordan vadung râla khan lungawitaka um ṭawk ṭawk ta lem ding kha aw."
8,"Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!","Aw Lalpa, hienga hmêlmahai hnawta Israelhai an tlânse el hi ieng tin am ka thaw ding a ni ta leh?"
9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?","Kanaan mihai le hieng laia chênghai po po hin hrieng an ta, mi hung inhuol an ta, hnuoi chunga inthawk hin kan hming an sukbo dai ding a ni hi; i hming ropuitak ta ding hin ieng am i thaw ding a ni ta leh?” a ta."
10,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?","LALPA chun Josua kuomah, “Tho rawh, iengdinga khânga i bawkkhup zing am a na?"
11,"Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.","Israelhai hin thil an suksuol a nih; ka thuthlung pawm dinga ka pêk kha an bawsiet a ni hi; thil pumpêk laia ṭhenkhat an lâk bawk a nih; an inrûk a, an ip bawk a, an thuomhnaw lai ngei an thuphmang a nih."
12,"Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.","Chuleichun, a nih annâwm Israel thlahaiin an hmêlmahai an ngam thei naw; mawchang an lo ni ta leiin annâwm an hmêlmahai an hnung innghat el chu; thil pumpêk chu in laia in sukbo phawt naw chun in kuoma hin ka um ta naw ding a nih."
13,"Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.","Tho la, mipuihai hi hlânthieng phawt el rawh; chun, an kuomah, ‘Zînga dingin inhlânthieng ro khai, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun, “Aw Israelhai, nangni lai hin thil pumpêk a um a nih, nangni laia thil pumpêk hi in lâk hmang hmakhat chun in hmêlmahai hi hne thei naw ti niu,” a ti a nih."
14,"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.","Chuongchun, zîngkâr a chi chia hung inlang ding in nih; LALPAIN chu mi chi a lo man chu a hnam hnamin in hung inlang nâwk ding a nih; chun, LALPAIN chu hnam a lo man chu a sûng sûngin in hung inlang nâwk ding a nih; chun, LALPAIN chu sûng a lo man chu a khât khâtin in hung inlang nâwk ding a nih."
15,"And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.","Chun, tukhawm thil pumpêk lo la ta chu ama le a thil nei po po leh meia raw vawng ding a nih; LALPA thuthlung a bawsiet lei le, Israelhai lai thil suol invêtthlâktak a thaw leiin,’ ti rawh” a ta."
16,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:","Chun, Josua chu zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, Israelhai chu a chi chiin a hung inlang tir a; Juda chihai chu man an lo ni tah a."
17,and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:,"Juda hnamhai chu a hung inlangtir nâwk a; Zer hnamhai chu a lo man a, Zerhai sûnghai chu a khât khâtin a hung inlangtir nâwk a; Zabdi chu man a lo ni tah a."
18,"and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.","Zabdi sûnghai chu a khât khâtin a hung inlangtir nâwk a; chuongchun, Juda chia mi Zera naupa, Zabdi, chu naupa Karmi,"
19,"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.","chu naupa Akan chu man a lo ni tah a. Josua chun Akan kuoma chun, “Ka naupa, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu ropuina pe rawh, a kuoma chun inphuong raw khai; i thilthaw chu mi hang hril ta, ka kuoma chu ip naw raw khai,” a ta."
20,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:","Akan chun Josua chu a dawn a, a kuomah, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien chunga chun thil ka lo suksuol ta ngei el, hieng ang hin a nih ka lo thaw chu:"
21,"when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.","râllâk laia mi Babulon ram puon ṭhatak le, tangka shekel za hni le, rângkachak tlang shekel sâwmnga bûk ka hmuh a, kân hnar êm a, ka lâk el a nih; chun, ngai ta, ka puon in sûngah hnuoiah thuphmang a na, tangka chu chu hnuoia chun a um,” a tih a."
22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.","Chuongchun, Josua chun mihai a tir a, puon in sûnga chun an va tlân a; chun, puon ina chun thuphmang a lo ni a, hnuoia chun tangka khawm chu a um ngei ti an hmuh a."
23,"And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before Jehovah.","Chuongchun, puon in sûnga inthawk chun an lâk a, Josua le Israel thlahai po po kuoma chun an hung chawi a; LALPA hmaa chun an sie tah a."
24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor.","Chun, Josua le Israelhai po po chun, Zera naupa Akan chu tangka dâm, puon dâm, rângkachak tlang dâm, a naupahai dâm, a naunuhai dâm, a bâwngchalhai dâm, a sabeng- tunghai dâm, a berâmhai le a puon in dâm le a neihai po po le chun an ṭhuoi a, Akor ruomah an hang fepui a."
25,"And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.","Chun, Josua chun, “Iengdinga i mi suklungzîng am a na? LALPA chun nang khawm vawisûn hin a suklungzîng ve ding che a ni hi,” a ta. Chuongchun, Israelhai po po chun ama chu lungin an dêng a; chun, ama chu meiin an rawh a, lungin an dêng bawk a."
26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.","A chunga chun lung an intieng vûm thûr a, tu chen hin a la um a; chun, LALPA lunginsenna nasatak chu a re tah a; chuongchun, chu hmun hminga chun tu chen hin Akor ruom an la ti zing a."
