1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,","Hazar lal Jabinin chu chu a lo hriet chun Madon lal Jobab hai, Simron lal hai, Aksaph lal hai,"
2,"and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,","hmartienga tlâng ram lalhai dâm, Kinneroth simtienga Araba lal hai, phai ram lal hai dâm, thlang- tieng panga Dor tlâng sâng lal hai,"
3,"to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.","saktieng le thlangtienga um Kanaan mihai dâm, tlângrama um Amor mihai, Hit mihai, Periz mihai, Jebus mihai, Mizpa ram Hermon tlâng hnuoia umhai Hiv mihai kuoma dâm mi a tir a."
4,"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.","An sipai ruolhai leh mi tamtak, an tam tieng chu tuisuoriet kama phaiphin zât zet, sakawr le tawlailîr tamtak leh an inthawk tah a."
5,"And all these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.","Chuong lalhai po po chu an intuok khâwm a, Israelhai chu thaw tumin Merom tuiahai chun an riek khâwm a."
6,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “Anni leiin ṭi naw rawh, zîngah hieng tik phât hin anni chu sukhlum sa vawngin Israelhai chu ka hung pêk el ding a nih; an sakawr thahai chu sat pêk i ta, an tawlailîrhai chu i raw el ding a nih,” a ta."
7,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.","Chuongchun, Josua le râlkâp mihai po po chu Merom tuiahai chun an vân thawk ta phut el a, an baw tah a."
8,"And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.","Chun, LALPAIN anni chu Israel- hai kutah a pêk a, an thawh a, Zidon Ropui chen dâm, Misrephoth-maim hmun chen dâm, saktieng panga Mizpe ruom chen dâmin an hnawt a; pakhat khawm hla hrim hrim nei loin an that vawng a."
9,"And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade him: he hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.","LALPAIN a tir angin, Josua chun an chunga chun a thawh a, an sakawr thahai chu a satpêk a, an tawlailîrhai chu a rawpêk bawk a."
10,"And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.","Chuong lai chun Josua chu a hnungkîr a, Hazor chu a lâk a, an lal chu kâwlhnâmin a that a, kha hma khan chu Hazor chu chuong lai vêl ram po poa khawpui tak a nih."
11,"And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.","Chu khuoa mi umhai po po chu kâwlhnâmin an that vawng a, an sukchimit dêr a, ân thuokthei taphawt chu pakhat khawm an hla nawh, chuongchun, Hazor chu meiin a raw tah a."
12,"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.","Chun, chuong lalhai khawpui- hai po po le an lalhai po po chu Josua chun a lâk vawng a, kâwlhnâma thawin a that a, a sukchimit vawng a; LALPA siehlaw Mosien thu a pêk ang khan."
13,"But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.","Amiruokchu, muolvûma khaw- pui lo umhai kha chu Hazor tilo chu Israelhai chun pakhat khawm an raw nawh a, chu khuo ruok chu Josuain a raw a nih."
14,"And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.","Chuong khawpuia an râllâkhai po po le ranhai chu Israel thlahai chun anni chanpuolah an nei a, mihriem ruok chu an sukbohmang vawng hmakhat chu kâwlhnâmin an that a, ân thuokthei taphawt chu hla an nei nawh."
15,"As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPAIN a siehlaw Mosie thu a pêk ang bawkin, Mosie khawmin Josua chu thu a pêk veh a, chuong ang tak chun Josua chun a thaw pei a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk po po chu thaw naw hrim a nei dêr nawh."
16,"So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;","Chuongchun, Josua chun chuong ram po po, tlâng ram dâm, sim ram po po dâm, Gosen ram po po dâm, phai ram dâm, Araba dâm, Israelhai tlâng ram dâm, an phai ramhai leh a lâk vawng a."
17,"from mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death.","Seir tlâng hang khawtu Halak tlânga inthawka Hermon tlâng hnuoia Lebanon ruoma Baal-gad chenin; an lalhai po po chu a man a, a that a, a sukhlum vawng a."
18,Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.,Josua chun chuong lalhai po po chu sâwttak a do a nih.
19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle.","Gibeon khuoa um Hiv mihai ti chau naw chu Israel mihai le inremna siem khuo hrim an um dêr nawh a, doa an lâk vawng an nih."
20,"For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang anga sukchimit vawng a, ditsakna nei dêr loa a sukbohmang theina dinga an lungril sukngarpêka Israel- hai indotir hlaktu chu LALPA chu a ni sih a."
21,"And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.","Chuong lai chun Josua chu a feh a, tlâng rama inthawk dâmin, Hebrona inthawk dâmin, Debira in- thawk dâmin, Anaba inthawk dâmin, Juda tlâng rama inthawk dâmin, Israel tlâng ram po poa inthawk dâmin, Anakim mihai chu a sukchi- mit vawng a, Josua chun an khawpuihai pumin a sukbohmang vawng a,"
22,"There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.","Israel thlahai rama chun Anakim mihai chu pakhat khawm um an um ta dêr nawh a, Gazaa dâm, Gatha dâm, Asdoda dâm ruok chun chu a um an la um a."
23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah spake unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie kuoma a hril po po ang khan Josua chun ram pumpui chu a lâk tah a; chun, Josua chun Israel mihai chu an hnam inṭhe dân ang peiin an rochan dingin a pêk tâwl a; chuongchun, ram chu râlmuongin a um tah a."
