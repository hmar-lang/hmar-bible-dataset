1,"And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,","Chun, a hnam pumpui chun Jordan an kai fai vawng hnungin LALPAIN Josua kuoma chun,"
2,"Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,","“Mipuihai laia mi hi mi sâwm- pahni, hnam tina mi pakhat pei thlang suok la, an kuomah,"
3,"and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night.","‘Jordan vadung lailung, thiempu- hai ngîrna laitaka mi lung sâwmpa- hni la unla, put phei unla, riebûk, vawizâna in riekna dingah sie ro,’ tiin thu pe rawh,” tiin a hril a."
4,"Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:","Chuongchun, Josua chun Israel thlahai laia mi sâwmpahni, hnam tina mi pakhat pei a thlang suokhai chu a ko a;"
5,"and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;","chun, Josua chun an kuomah, “LALPA in Pathien bâwm hmaa khan Jordan vadung lailungah fe unla, Israel thlahai hnam zât, hnam khat ta ding, mi tinin pakhat pei, lung pakhat seng in liengkoah put ro khai."
6,"that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?","Nakie in nauhaiin, ‘Hieng lung- hai hi ieng inentirna am a na?’ tia an la hung indawn pha chun,"
7,"then ye shall say unto them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.","nangnîn an kuomah, ‘LALPA thuthlung bâwm hmaah Jordan tui- hai chu a hung intan ta lei a nih: chuongchun, hieng lunghai hi Israel thlahaiin kumkhuoa an hriet zingna ding a ni hi,’ in la ti ding a nih,” a tih a."
8,"And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.","Chun, Israel thlahai chun Josua- in thu a pêk ang chun an thaw a, LALPAIN Josua kuoma a hril angtak chun, Israel thlahai hnam zât Jordan vadung lailunga mi lung sâwmpahni chu an lâk a; an riekna hmuna chun an put phei a, chutaka chun an sieh a."
9,"And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.","Chun, thuthlungna bâwm zâwn- tu thiempuhai ngîrna lai tak, Jordan vadung lailunga chun Josua chun lung sâwmpahni a phun a, chuong chu tu chen hin a la um zing a nih."
10,"For the priests that bare the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.","Mosien Josua kuoma thu a lo pêk ta po po anga, LALPAIN mipui- hai kuoma hril dinga Josua thu a pêk chu thaw vawng a ni hmakhat chun thiempu bâwm zâwntuhai chu Jordan vadung lailunga chun an ngîr zing el a. Chuongchun, mipuihai chu an insukhmawh a, an kai tâwl tah a."
11,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.",Mipui po po chu an kai vawng hnung chun LALPA bâwm le thiem- puhai chu mipuihai mithmua chun an kai ve tah a.
12,"And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:","Reuben thlahai, Gad thlahai le Manasse hnam zâtvehai chu Mosien an kuoma a lo hril ta ang khan Israel thlahai hmaa chun inrâlthuom sain an kai a;"
13,"about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.","râlthuoma inthuom sa diem mi sîng li lai indo dingin Jeriko phaiahai chun LALPA hmaah an kai a nih,"
14,"On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.","Chu ni chun LALPAIN Josua chu Israelhai po po mithmua chun a chawimawi a, Mosie an ṭi ang bawk khan a dam sûng po chun ama chu an ṭi tah a."
15,"And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,","LALPA chun Josua kuoma chun thu a hril a,"
16,"Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.","“Thiempuhai thuthlung bâwm zâwntuhai kha Jordan vadunga in- thawka hung suok ding thu pe rawh,” tiin."
17,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.","Chuongchun, Josua chun thiempuhai chu “Jordan vadunga inthawk khan hung suok ta ro khai,” tiin thu a pêk a."
18,"And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime.","Thiempuhai LALPA thuthlung bâwm zâwntuhai chu Jordan vadung- a inthawka an hung suok a, thiem- puhai ke chun khawmuol chu a sir char leh Jordan tuihai chu an luong pângngaiin an hung luong nâwk a, a hma ang bawk khan a kuong sip chun a luong liem nâwk ta dum dum a."
19,"And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.","Mipuihai chu thla khatna ni sâwm niin Jordan vadunga inthawk chu an suok a, Jeriko sak tieng pang- a Gilgala chun umhmun an khuor tah a."
20,"And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.","Chuong lung sâwmpahni, Jordan vadunga inthawka an put dawkhai kha Josua chun Gilgala chun a phun tah a."
21,"And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?","Chun, Israel thlahai kuoma chun thu a hril a, “Nakie phaleh in thlahaiin an pahai, ‘Hieng lunghai hi ieng inentirna am a na?’ tia an la hung indawn pha chun,"
22,"then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.","‘Israelhai chun Jordan vadung hi hnuoi hulah an kai a nih,’ tiin in thlahai chu in lân hriettir ding a nih."
23,"For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over;","LALPA in Pathien chun inhmaa Tuipui Sen chu ei kai hmakhata ei hmaa a lo sukkangtan ta ang khan, LALPA in Pathienin Jordan tuihai hi in kai hmakhat chu in hmaah a sukkangtan ta a ni hi."
24,"that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye may fear Jehovah your God for ever.","Leihnuoia hnam tinrêngin LALPA kut hi a lo hrât a nih ti an hriet thei a, LALPA in Pathien chu kumkhuoa an ṭi theina dingin,” tiin."
