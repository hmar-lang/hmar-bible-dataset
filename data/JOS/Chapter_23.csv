1,"And it came to pass after many days, when Jehovah had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;","Kum ieng zât lai amanih ân vawi a, Israelhai chu an kâwl- vêla hmêlma po pohaia inthawk muongna LALPÂN a pêk hnung chun, Josua khawm chu a hung upa tah a, a hung tar ta hle el a."
2,"that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years:","Josua chun Israel mipuihai po po, an upahai le an lusahai le, an rorêltuhai le an hotuhai chu ân kotir a, an kuomah, “Kei chu ka upain ka lo tar tah a,"
3,"and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for Jehovah your God, he it is that hath fought for you.","LALPA in Pathienin nangni leia hieng hnamhai po po chunga a thaw dân hi in hmuh a, LALPA in Pathien, ama ngeiin a nih a dopêk cheu chu."
4,"Behold, I have allotted unto you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun.","Ngai ta u, hieng hnam a la umhai hi, hieng hnam ka sukbo tahai po po ramhai le hin, Jordana inthawka nisa tlâkna tieng Tuisuoriet Lien tlung rakin in chihai rochanah ka ruotpêk cheu a nih."
5,"And Jehovah your God, he will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God spake unto you.","Chun, LALPA in Pathienin in hmaa hin hnawt suok a ta, in hmu phâk nawah hnawt hmang vawng a ta; chuongchun, LALPA in Pathienin in kuoma a hril ta ang khan an ram chu in nei ding a nih."
6,"Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;","Chuleiin, Mosie dân lekhabua ziek po pohai hi changtienga manih, vawitienga manih in pêtsan nawna dingin huoitakin pawm unla, thaw bawk ro;"
7,"that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves unto them;","hieng hnam nangni laia la umhai le hin inchekpawl loin an pathienhai hming khawm lam hlek loa, an hming sâla ṭawng khawm inkhâm loa an rawng khawm bâwl loa, kûna chibai inbûk nawna dingin,"
8,"but cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye have done unto this day.","vawisûn chena in la thaw zing ang hin, LALPA in Pathien chu chel tlat lem hlak ro."
9,"For Jehovah hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath stood before you unto this day.",LALPAIN in hmaa chi ropuitak le hrâttak chu a hnawt suok vawng ta hi; nangni hmaa chun vawisûn ni chen khawm hin tukhawm a ṭhang thei hrim hrim an um dêr naw hi.
10,"One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he spake unto you.","Nangni laia mi pakhat chun mi sâng khat in hnawt a, in kuoma a lo hril ta angin, LALPA in Pathien hin a do pêk hlak cheu leiin."
11,"Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love Jehovah your God.","Chuongchun, LALPA in Pathien chu hmangai dingin fimkhur ṭha hle ro."
12,"Else if ye do at all go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you;","Chuong naw chun, in nghatsan hlau a, hieng hnam la umhai, nangni laia la chêng zinghai hi in inkawppui a, anni le nuhmei pasal in innei a, anni chu in pâwl a, anni khawma an pâwl vai cheu chun,"
13,"know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you.","LALPA in Pathienin hieng hnamhai hi in mithmua chun a hnawt suok pêk ta naw tawp ding cheu a nih, LALPA in Pathienin hi ram ṭhatak a pêk cheua hin in bohmang vawng hmakhat chun anni chu in ta dingin châng le bil le in nâkphêk ta dinga vuokna hmawl le, in mit ta dinga hling hung ni lem an tih ti chiengtakin hre ro khai."
14,"And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof.","Chun, ngai ta u, tuhin leihnuoi po po dân angin, ka fe ve ding a ni tah a nih, LALPA in Pathienin in chung- châng a ṭha tieng a lo hril tahai po po kha ân khêl pakhat khawm a um nawh ti in lungril po po le in lungvar po poin in hriet a nih, in chungah a hung tlung vawng tah a, pakhat khawm ân khêl a um nawh."
15,"And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which Jehovah your God spake unto you, so will Jehovah bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you.","Amiruokchu, LALPA in Pa- thienin thil ṭha in kuoma a hrilhai po po kha in chunga a hung tlung vawng ta ang bawk hin LALPA in Pathienin hi ram ṭhatak a pêk cheua inthawk hi a sukbohmang vawng hmakhat cheu LALPAIN thil ṭha nawhai in chungah la hung intlungtir vêng a tih."
16,"When ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.","LALPA in Pathienin thuthlung a pêk cheu hi in bawsiet a, pathien danghai rawng inbâwl a, kûna chibai inbûk vai chun LALPA lunginsenna chu in chungah inling a ta, ram ṭhatak a pêk cheua inthawk hi bo- hmang nghâl el in tih,” a ta."
