1,"Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king), and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;","Chun, Jerusalem lal, Adoni- zedek chun Josuain Ai khuo a lâk a, a suksiet dêr a, Jeriko le an lal a suksiet angin, Ai khuo le an lal khawm a suksiet dêr a, Gibeona mihai chun Israelhai le chun inremna an siem a, anni lai an chêng ve tah ti a lo hriet chun, a ṭi ta hle el a."
2,"that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.","Gibeon chu khaw lientak, lal khawpui ang a ni sih a, Ai khuo nêk chun a ropui lem a, mihriem po pohai khawm chu mi hrâttak an ni sih a."
3,"Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,","Chuongchun, Jerusalem khaw lal Adoni-zedek chun Hebron lal Hosham, Jarmuth lal Piram, Lakis lal Japhia le Eglon lal Debir hai chu,"
4,"Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.","“Hung unla, mi hung ṭhangpui ro khai, Gibeon hi va thawng ei tiu, Josua le Israel thlahai leh inremna an siem ta sih a,” tiin ân cha khâwm a."
5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.","Chuongchun, Amor mihai lalhai panga, Jerusalem lal, Hebron lal, Jarmuth lal, Lakis lal, le Eglon lal chu an pung khâwm a, an sipaihai po po leh an hang feh a, Gibeon epa chun an um a, an indopui tah a."
6,"And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.","Chun, Gibeon mihai chun an riebûk Gilgalah, Josua kuomah mi an tir a, “I siehlawhai hi ngaitha naw raw khai; inhmawtakin kan kuomah hung vat la, mi hung sandam la, mi hung ṭhangpui rawh: tlâng rama chênghai Amor lalhai keini mi thaw dingin an inhâwrkhâwm a nih,” tiin."
7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.","Chuongchun, Josua le a kuoma râl kâp mi po po le, mi hrât huoisen- hai po po chu, Gilgala inthawk chun an hang feh a."
8,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.","Chun, LALPAIN Josua kuomah, “Anni chu ṭi dêr naw rawh, i kutah ka pêk vawng tah a nih; anni laia mi tukhawm i hmaah ngîr thei ding hrim hrim an um nawh,” a tih a."
9,Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; for he went up from Gilgal all the night.,"Chuongchun, zânkhuoa Gilgala inthawka hang fein Josua chun thâwk lekhatin anni chu a thaw ta thut a."
10,"And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.","LALPAIN anni chu Israelhai hmaa chun a sukbuoi tah a, Gibeona chun tamtak a that a, Beth-horon hang fena lampuiah a hnawt a, Azeka le Makeda chenin a that pei a."
11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.","Chun, Israel mihai hmaa an tlânsie a, Beth-horona inthawka liem thlâkna hmuna an um lai chun LALPAIN vâna inthawkin riel lien- tak takin Azeka chenin a zuk indêng- tir pei a, an thi a, Israel thlahaiin kâwlhnâma an sât hlum nêk hmanin riel dêng hlum chu an tam lem a nih."
12,"Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Amor mihai chu Israel thlahai kuta a pêk ni chun Josua chun LALPA kuomah thu a hril a, Israel mihai mithmua chun, “Nisa, Gibeon chungah ngîr zing rawh. Nang khawm, thlapa, Aijalon ruoma hin um zing rawh”, a ta"
13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.","Chuongchun, chu hnam chun an hmêlmahai chunga phuba an lâk hmakhat chun nisa chu a ngîr ta zing a, thla khawm chu a um ta zing a. Hi thu hi Jaser buah ziek a ni naw am a nih? Chuongchun, nisa chu vân laizâwlah a um ta zing a, ni khat pumhlûm lai tlâk zai hrim hrim a rêl nawh."
14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.","LALPAIN chuong anga mi- hriem râwl a ngai ni ang chu a hmain ni hrim hrim a um ngai nawh a, a hnunga khawm a um ngai bawk nawh; LALPAIN Israelhai chu a dopui a ni sih a."
15,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.","Chun, Josua le Israel mihai po po chu Gilgala an riebûka chun an kîr nâwk vawng tah a."
16,"And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.","Chuong lal pangahai chu an tlân hmang a, Makeda pûkah an inbih a."
17,"And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.","Chun, “Lal pangahai chu hmu an ni tah, Makeda pûka inbi an nih,” ti Josua chu an hril a."
18,"And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:","Chuongchun, Josua chun, “Pûk kawtkhâra chun lung lientak tak inhlum unla, a vêngtuhai khawm inumtir ro."
19,"but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.","Nangni ruok chu um naw unla, in hmêlmahai chu hnawt pei unla, a hnung dâlhai kha that unla, an khuoa hrim hrim inlûttir naw ro, LALPA in Pathien chun anni chu in kutah a pêk ta sih a,” a ta."
20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,","Chun, Josua le Israel thlahai chun an chimit hmakhata, an that an that zo a, a um sunhai khawm chu khawpui kulpui neia dâm an lût hnung chun,"
21,that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.,"mi po po chu Josua kuom tieng Makedaa chun râl muongtakin an hung nâwk tah a, tukhawma Israel thlahai tienga hrim hrim an lei an sukchâng nawh."
22,"Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.","Chuongchun, Josua chun, “Pûk kawtkhâr kha hang hawng unla, lal pangahai kha pûka inthawkin ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro,” a tih a."
23,"And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.","Chuong ang chun an thawh a, chu lal panga Jerusalem lal, Hebron lal, Jarmuth lal, Lakis lal le Eglon lal hai chu pûka inthawk chun a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a."
24,"And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.","Chuong lalhai chu Josua kuoma an hung ṭhuoi chun, Josua chun Israel mihai po po chu a ko khâwm a, a kuoma fe ve râl kâp mihai laia lusa deu deuhai kuoma chun, “Hung hnai unla, hieng lalhai ringahai hin in kephahaiin sir ro,” a ta. Chun, an hung hnai a, an ringahai chun an kephahai chun an sir tah a."
25,"And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.","Josua chun an kuomah, “Ṭi naw unla, zâm bawk naw ro, hrâttak le huoitakin um lem ro; in hmêlmahai po po in dohai chungah LALPA chun hieng ang hin a thaw pei ding a nih,” a ta."
26,"And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.","Chu zoa chun, Josua chun a thawh a, a sukhlum tâwl a, thing panga lêrah a khai a, chuongchun, zântieng chen chun thing lêra chun an inkhai a."
27,"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.","Nisa tlâka chun Josua chun thu a pêk a, thing lêra inthawk chun an lâk thlâk a, an inbîkna pûka khan an peilût a, pûk kawtkhâr chu lung lien- tak takin an sîn a, tu chen khawm hin a la um zing."
28,"And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.","Josua chun chu ni chun Makeda chu a lâk a, a lal khawm kâwlhnâmin a thawh a, chu khuoa um po pohai le chun a sukhlum fai rêt a, pakhat khawm hla hrim hrim a nei nawh. Jeriko lal chunga a thaw ang bawk khan Makeda lal chunga khawm a thawh a."
29,"And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:","Chun, Josua chu Israelhai po po leh Makeda khuoa inthawk chun Libna tieng an feh a, Libna chu an thawh a,"
30,"and Jehovah delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho.","chuongchun, chu khuo chu an lal pumin Israelhai kutah a pêk nâwk bawk a; chun, chu khuo chu thawin a sûnga um po pohai chu kâwlhnâmin an sukhlum vawng a, a sûngah mi pakhat khawm hla hrim hrim an nei nawh; Jeriko khaw lal chunga an thaw ang bawk khan chu khaw lal chunga khawm chun an thawh a."
31,"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:","Chun, Josua chu Israelhai po po leh Libnaa inthawk chun Lakis tieng chun an feh a, ṭhanghmun an khuor a, an do tah a,"
32,"and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.","chuongchun, LALPAIN Lakis chu Israelhai kutah a pêk a, a ni hni niin an lâk a, chu khuo chu thawin a sûnga umhai po po kâwlhnâmin an sukhlum vawng a, Libna chunga an thaw ang bawk khan."
33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.","Chuongchun, Gezer lal Horam chu Lakis ṭhangpui dingin a hung a, chun, Josua chun ama le a rawihai leh pakhat khawm hlâ hlek loin a lo that rip a."
34,"And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;","Chun, Josua chu Israelhai po po leh Lakis a inthawk chun Eglon tieng chun an feh a, ṭhanghmun an khuor a, an do tah a."
35,"and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.","Chu ni ma chun an lâk a, chu ni ma chun chu khuo chu thawin a sûnga um po pohai kâwlhnâmin an sukhlum fai rêt a, Lakis chunga an thaw ang bawk khan."
36,"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:","Chun, Josua chu Israelhai po po leh Eglona inthawkin Hebron tieng an hang feh a, an do tah a,"
37,"and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.","chuongchun, an lâk tah a; chu khuo le a lal le a khawpui po po leh, a sûnga um po pohai chu kâwlhnâmin an thawh a, an sukhlum vawng a, Eglon chunga an thaw ang bawk khan pakhat khawm hlâ hrim hrim an nei nawh a; a suksiet letdêr a, a mi umhai po po an sukhlum fai rêt a."
38,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:","Chun, Josua le Israelhai po po chu Debir tieng chun an lêt nâwk a, an do a;"
39,"and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.","chuongchun, chu khuo le a lal le a khawpuihai po po chu an lâk a, chun, kâwlhnâmin an thawh a, a sûnga mi um po pohai chu an sukhlum fai rêt a, pakhat khawm hlâ hrim hrim an nei nawh; Hebron chunga thaw ang khan Debir le a lal chunga khawm an thawh a, Libna khuo le a lal chunga an thaw ang bawk khan."
40,"So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.","Chuongchun, Josua chun a ram pumin, tlâng ram dâm, Sim ram dâm, phai ram dâm, ṭên pangpêr ram dâm chu sukse vawngin, an lal po pohai chu a sukhlum vawng a; pakhat bêk khawm hlâ hrim hrim a nei dêr nawh: LALPA Israelhai Pathien thupêk angin, ân thuok thei taphawt chu a sukchimit vawng ta lem a."
41,"And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.","Chun, Josua chun Kades- Barneaa inthawkin Gaza chenin, Gosen ram po po leh Gibeon chenin a lâkpêk vawng a,"
42,"And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.",chuong lalhai po po le an ramhai chu LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun Israelhai chu a dopui leiin Josua chun ṭum khata a lâk vawng an nih.
43,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.","Chun, Josua le Israel mihai po po chu Gilgala an riebûkah an kir nâwk tah a."
