1,"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.","Chuongchun, chu thla ni sâwm- hni pali ni chun Israel thlahai chu bu ngheia, saiip puon sila an lua pilvut kai nungin an fe khâwm tâwl a."
2,"And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.","Chun, Israel hnam chu hnam danghai laia chun an insuktum a; an ngîr a, an suolnahai le an pi le puhai bawsietna thupha an chawi a."
3,"And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.","Chun, mâni hmun sengah an ngîr a, chu ni hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat sûng chun LALPA an Pathien dân bu an tiem a; chun, hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat dang sung chun thupha an chawi a, LALPA an Pathien chu an biek a."
4,"Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto Jehovah their God.","Chuongchun, Levi mihai dawkân insânga chun Jesua, Bani, Kadmiel, Sebania, Bunni, Serebia, Bani, Kena- ni hai chu an ngîr a; inringtakin LALPA an Pathien chu an ko a."
5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.","Chuongchun, Levi mi, Jesua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hasabneia, Serebia, Hodia, Sebania le Pethahia hai chun an hril a, “Ngîr unla, LALPA in Pathien chu chatuona inthawka cha- tuon chenin inpâk ro khai; chun, chawimawina le inpâkna po po khawmin a phâk lo, i hming ropui chu inpâkin um raw se."
6,"Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.","“Nangma chau hi LALPA i na, vânhai vân le a sûnga um po pohai le, leihnuoi le a sûnga um po pohai leh, tuisuoriet le a sûnga umhai po po leh i siem a, a rêng chun i kawl ṭha hlak a; chun, vâna umhai chun chibai an bûk hlak che kha."
7,"Thou art Jehovah the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham,","Abram chu thlanga, Kaldai ram Ur khuoa inthawka ṭhuoi suoka, a hminga Abraham saktu, LALPA Pathien i nih;"
8,"and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous.","chun, a lungril chu i hmaa chun ringumin i hriet a; Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Amor mihai, Periz mihai, Jebus mihai, Girgas mihai ram chu ama kuoma pe dingin, a thlahai chena pe dingin thu i thlung a; chun, i thu chu i hlen bawk a, feltak i ni sih a."
9,"And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea,","Aigupta rama kan pi le puhai rinumzie chu i hmu zing a, Tuisuoriet Sen kama an khêkri chu i hriet a;"
10,"and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and didst get thee a name, as it is this day.","Pharao le a siehlawhai po po le, a rama mi po pohai chungah inchikna le thilmakhai în langtir a; chapotakin an chunga thil an thaw ti i hriet sih a, chuongchun, tu chen hin hming în siem tah a."
11,"And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.","Chun, an hmaa chun tuisuoriet chu i sukṭheh a, chuongchun, hnuoi hulah tuisuoriet sûng chu an fe thleng a; anni hnawttuhai chu tui inthûktakah, tui nasataka lung pei lût ang elin i pei lût a."
12,"Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.","Sûna chun sûm ngîrin i ṭhuoi hlak a, zâna khawm an fena ding lampuia anni ên dingin meichawk ngîrin i ṭhuoi hlak."
13,"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,","Sinai tlânga chun i hung ṭum bawk a, vâna inthawkin an kuoma chun thu i hril a; rorêlna indiktakhai dâm, dân indiktakhai dâm, thuruot le thupêk ṭha takhai chu i pêk a;"
14,"and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant,","i châwlni inthieng chu anni în hriettir a, i siehlaw Mosie hmangin thupêk dâm, thuruot dâm, dân dâm i pêk a;"
15,"and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.","an phîngṭam sukrena dingin vâna inthawkin bei i pêk a, an dang- châr sukrêna dingin lungpuia in- thawkin tui i suksuokpêk a, i bân phar meua, ‘Pêng ka tih,’ i ti ram hluo ding thu i pêk a."
16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,","Nisienlakhawm, anni le kan pi le puhai chun, chapotakin thil an thawh a, an insukkâwmawh a, i thu- pêk chu an pawm nawh a,"
17,"and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not.","an awi nuom nawh a, anni laia i thilmak thawhai khawm chu an hriet nuom ta bawk nawh a; an insuk- kâwmawh a, an helin an suok nina tienga lêt nâwk dingin hotu an ruot lem a; amiruokchu, nang chu ngai- dam dinga inzosa zing Pathien, mi lunginsiet thei, lainatnaa sip, lung inuoi, zainêmna hau i na, anni chu i nghatsan chuong nawh a."
18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;","Anih, an ta dingin bâwngtê lim an siem a, ‘Hi hi a nih, Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoisuoktu che i pathien chu,’ an tih a, lunginsenumtak thil an thaw lai khawm khan,"
19,"yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.","i lunginsietna nasatak chun thlalêra khan i thlathlam chuong nawh a: lampuia anni ṭhuoi dinga an chunga sûm ngîr chun sûnah anni a mâksan chuong nawh a, anni ên ding le an fena lampui khîkhmu dinga meichawk ngîr khawm chun zânah a fesan bawk nawh."
20,"Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.","Anni inchûktir dingin i thlarau ṭhatak chu i pêk bawk a, i manna chu an baua a lût i phal naw nawh a, an dangchâr sukrêna dingin tui i pêk a."
21,"Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.","Anih, thlalêra khan kum sâwm- li i châwm a, iengkhawm an tlasam nawh a; an silfênhai chu a hlui nawh a, an kehai khawm chu ân vûng bawk nawh a."
22,"Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.","Chun, ram le hnamhai i pêk a, chuonghai chu an chanpuol i sempêk seng a; chuongchun, Sihon ram Hesbon lal ram le, Basan lal Og ram chu an hluoh a."
23,"Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.",An thlahai chu vâna arasi zâtin i sukpung bawk a; an hluo dinga an pi le puhai kuoma i lo hril tah rama chun i ṭhuoi lût tah a.
24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.","Chuongchun, an thlahai chun ram chu an hluo tah a, chun, nangin chu rama um Kanaan mihai chu an hmaah i suktlâwm a, an nuom nuom an law dingin an lalhai le chu rama mihai le chun an kutah i pêk a."
25,"And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.","Kulnei khawpuihai le ram ṭhatak takhai chu an lâk a, thilṭha tinrênga sip inhai chu an hluoh a, tuikhur huotsa hai, grêp huonhai, oliv huon dâm, thei kûng tamtakhai chu an nei a; chuongchun, an fâk a, an khawp a, an hung thâu a, i ṭhatna nasataka chun nuom an chên a."
26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations.","Nisienlakhawm, an hung kâw- mawh a, i chungah an hel a, i Dân chu an hnungsawn dai a, nangma tieng innghattir nâwk tumtu i zâwlneihai chu an that a, lungsenumtak tak thilhai an thawh a."
27,"Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.","Chuleichun, anni sukrinumtu an hmêlmahai kuta chun i pêk a; an lunginzîng laia an ko lai che khan vâna inthawk chun i lo ngai a; i zainêmna nasatak chun an hmêlma- haia inthawkin sansuoktu ding sandamtuhai i pêk a."
28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies,","Nisienlakhawm, râlmuonga an hung um hnung chun i mithmuah thil ṭha naw an thaw nâwk el a: chuleiin, an hmêlmahai kutah i pêk a; chuongchun, an chungah thu an nei a; nisienlakhawm, an hung inleta an ko lai che khan vâna inthawkin i lo ngai a; vawi tamtak i zainêmna chun i sansuok a."
29,"and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances (which if a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.","“I dâna i ṭhuoi lût thei nâwkna dingin i kâwk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, chapotakin thil an thawh a, i thupêk- hai an pawm nawh a, i rorêlna kalin thil an suksuol a; (miin an zâwma an hringpui ding chu); chun, an tuk- hnungkhur an innghat a, an insuk- kâwmawh a, an ngai nuom nawh a."
30,"Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.","Nisienlakhawm, kum tamtak anni chu i dawh a, i thlaraua i zâwl- neihai hmangin i kâwk hlak a; nisien- lakhawm, an na an suksêt a; chuleiin, chu rama mihai kuta chun i pêk tah a."
31,"Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.","Nisienlakhawm, i zainêmna na- satak chun an tâwp sawng elna ding chu în tlungtir nawh a; i thlathlam chuong bawk nawh, Pathien mi lunginsiet theitak, lainatnaa sip i ni sih a."
32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.","Chuleiin, kan Pathien, Pathien ropui, iengkim thawthei le ṭium, thuthlung hlena lunginsietna suk- langtu chun keini chunga le kan lalhai, kan mi lienhai dâm, kan thiempuhai dâm, kan zâwlneihai dâm, kan pi le puhai le i mihai po po chungah, Assuria lalhai inlal laia inthawka tu chena rinumna hung tlung zozai hi thil chîn thamah ngai nawh rawh."
33,"Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;","Iengkhawm ni sienla kan chunga thil hung tlung po poa hin, nang chu i fel a; nang chun indiktakin thil i thawh a, keini ruok chun ṭha naw takin kan thaw a nih;"
34,"neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them.","kan lalhai dâm, kan mi lienhai dâm, kan thiempuhai dâm, kan pi le kan puhai khawmin i Dân chu an zâwm nawh a, i thupêk le i thuin- hriettir, anni i kâwknahai chu an pawm bawk nawh."
35,"For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.","An chunga i ṭhat thei vei leh, an ramah, ram lientak le ram ṭhatak i pêka chun i rawng an bâwlpêk si naw cheh a, an thil suksuol khawm an bân chuong bawk nawh."
36,"Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.","Ngai ta, tu hlak hin mi salhai kan ni chu a ni el tah a; ram, a sûng thil ra le, thil ṭha kan pi le puhai fâk dinga i pêk hlak chu, ngai ta, chutaka chun salhai kan ni el tah a."
37,"And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.","Kan suol leia kan chunga lal dinga i ruothai hlak chun an neinung phah a, kan taksa chunga le kan ranhai chung takngiela khawm an nuom nuomin thu an nei a, kan lunginzîng êm êm el a nih,” tiin."
38,"And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal unto it.","Chuong po po lei chun thu dettak kan thlung a, kan ziek a, kan mi lienhai, kan Levi mihai le kan thiempuhaiin an namdetpui a."
