1,"On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,",Chu ni chun mipui na hrieta chun Mosie lekhabu an tiem a; chutaka chun Ammon mihai le Moab mihai chu Pathien mihai in- khâwmnaa chun ieng lai khawmin an ṭhang ve dêr ding a ni nawh ti hi a chuong a;
2,"because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.","Israel thlahai bei le tuia tuok lo a, anni ṭawngsie inphur dinga Balaam an ruoi lei khan; nisienlakhawm, ei Pathien chun ṭawngsie chu mal- sâwmnaah ân changtir ta lem a."
3,"And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.","Chun, Dân chu an hang ngai zo chun Israel mihai laia inthawk chun anni chawkpawltu mipuihai chu an suktum tah a."
4,"Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,","Chu hma chun kan Pathien in pindanhaia hotu dinga ruot thiempu Eliasib, Tobia tieng mi chun"
5,"had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.","kha hmaa Levi mihai, hlasak- tuhai, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chanvo, beiphit thilinhlân dâm, riminhnik dâm, bûr le bêlhai, bu sâwma pakhat dâm, uoin le hriek le thiempuhai ta ding a thêna thên thilinhlânhai an siena hlak pindan lientak Tobia ta ding chun a buotsaipêk a."
6,"But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,","Nisienlakhawm, chuong thil po pohai um lai chun Jerusalem khuoah ka um nawh a; Babulon lal Artazerzia kum sâwmthum pahni ân lal kumin lal kuoma chun ka fe a nih, ni ieng zât amani hnunga chun phalna ka hni nâwk a;"
7,"and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.","chun, Jerusalem khuoah ka va feh a, Pathien in inhuonna tuolsûng laia chun pindan buotsaipêka Tobia ta dinga Eliasab thil ṭha naw lo thaw chu ka hriet tah a."
8,And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.,"A mi suklungninaw êm êm el a; chuleiin, Tobia in sûng thuomhnaw po po, chu pindana inthawk chun ka the suok vawng a."
9,"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.","Chun, thu ka pêk a, pindanhai chu an inthiel fai a; chuongchun, Pathien in bûr le bêlhai chu beiphit thilinhlânhai le riminhnikhai le chun ka lâklût nâwk a."
10,"And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.","Chun, Levi mihai chu chanvo pêk an ni naw leiin, Levi mihai le hlasaktuhai chu mâni lo tieng sengah an tlândar ta ti ka hriet nâwk ta bawk a."
11,"Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.","Chuongchun, rorêltuhai chu ka khak a, “Ieng dinga Pathien in hi thlathlam a ni zing el am a ni leh?” ka tih a. Anni chu ka ko khâwm vawng a, an hmun sengah kân umtir nâwk a."
12,Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.,"Chuongchun, Juda mihai po po chun, bu sâwma pakhat dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm thawlâwm sie khâwmnaa chun an hung lâk khâwm tâwl a."
13,"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.","Chun, thiempu Selemia le lekhaziektu Zadok le Levi mihai laia mi Pedaia hai chu thawlâwm sie khâwmnahai hotu dingin ka siem a, anni ṭhangpuitu ding chun Mattania nau Zakkur naupa Hanan a um a; ringuma ngai an na; an sinthaw chu an unauhai laia thil sem vêl a nih."
14,"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.","Aw ka Pathien, hi thua hin mi hre zing la, ka Pathien in le a rawng- bâwlna dinga ka thil thaw ṭhathai chu thaihmang lul naw rawh."
15,"In those days saw I in Judah some men treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.","Chuong lai chun Juda rama chun châwlnia uoin sâwrna khura sir sâwr dâm, buphal hung phur dâm, uoin dâm, grêp dâm, theichang dâm, phurrik tinrêng inphurtir dinga siem sabengtung siem lai mêk dâm ka hmuh a; chuong chu châwlniah Jerusalemah an hung phur lût a; fâk ding zawr nihaia chun ân dik nawzie kân hriettir a."
16,"There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.","Tura rama mi chutaka chêng vehai khawmin ngahai le thuom- hnaw tinrênghai an hung lâk a, châwlniin Juda mihai kuoma le Jerusalemah an zawr a."
17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?","Chuongchun, Juda mi lienhai chu ka khak a, an kuomah, “Châwlni sukpawrchea in thil ṭha naw thaw hi ieng am a nih a?"
18,"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.","In pi le puhai khawm khan hieng ang hi an thaw a ni naw am a nih? Chun, ei Pathien chun hieng thil ṭha nawhai po po hi ei chunga le hi khaw chunga hin a hung intlungtir tah a ni naw am a nih? Chuong sa sa khawmin châwlni sukpawrchein Israel mihai chungah lunginsenna in lân tlungsatir rawp el hi,” ka tih a."
19,"And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.","Chun, châwlni dinga Jerusalem kul kawtkhâr ân thim deu hlek phingleh kawtkhârhai chu khâr ding- in thu ka pêk a; chun, châwlni a bo hmakhat chun hawng lo dingin thu ka pêk bawk a; châwlnia thil phur hrim hrim an lâklût nawna dingin ka mihai ṭhenkhat chu kawtkhâr kân vêngtir a."
20,So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.,"Chuongchun, sumdâwng mihai le thuomhnaw tinrêng zawr mihai chu vawi khat amanih, vawi hni amani chu Jerusalem puotienga chun an riek a."
21,"Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.","Chuongchun, ân dik nawzie chu kân hriettir a, an kuomah, “Ieng- dinga kul bula riek am in na? Hieng anga in thaw nâwk chun in chungah ka kut thlâk ka tih,” ka tih a. Chu chena inthawk chu châwlni chun an hung nâwk ta nawh a."
22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.","Chun, Levi mihai chu inthien faia, châwlni sukthiengna dinga kul kawtkhâr hung vêng dingin thu ka pêk a. Aw ka Pathien, hi thua khawm hin mi hre zing la, i lunginsietna nasatzie ang peiin mi hla rawh."
23,"In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:","Chuong lai chun Juda mi, Asdod nuhmei dâm, Ammon nuhmei dâm, Moab nuhmei dâm nuhmeia neihai chu ka hmuh a;"
24,"and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.","an nauhai chu Asdod ṭawngin an ṭawng lem hman hman a, chuong- hai ṭawng dân ang chau naw chun Juda ṭawngin an ṭawng thei nawh."
25,"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.","Chun, anni chu ka khak tâwl a, ṭawngsie kân phur a, ṭhenkhat lem chu ka vuok a, an sam dâm ka kei phawipêk a, an naunuhmeihai chu chuong naupasalhai chu inneitir lo ding le, chuonghai naunuhmeihai chu an naupasalhai ta dingin amanih, anni ta ding khawma nei lo dingin Pathien sâlin ṭawng kân khâmtir a."
26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.","“Israel lal Solomon khawm kha hieng thilhaia hin a suol a ni naw am a nih? Chuong sa khawm chun hnam tamtak laia ama ang lal an um nawh a, a Pathien mi dit zâwng tak a na, Israel ram po po chungah Pathienin lalah a siem bawk a; nisienlakhawm, ama meu khawm chu ram dang nu- hmeiin an suksuol el ta a nih."
27,"Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?","Chuongchun, ram dang nu- hmeihai neia ei Pathien chunga hin thil ṭha nawtak el hi thaw dingin in thu ei zâwm ding am a nih?” ka tih a."
28,"And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.","Chun, thiempu lal Eliasib nau, Joiada naupa pakhat Horon mi Sanballat mâkpa a na, chuleiin, ka kuoma inthawk chun kân tlân- hmangtir tah a."
29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.","Aw ka Pathien, thiempu nina sin le, thiemputna sin thuthlung le, Levi mihai thuthlung an sukpawrche leiin hre zing tâwl raw khai."
30,"Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;","Chuong ang chun ram dang mihaia inthawkin ka sukthieng a, thiempu dâm, Levi mihai ta dinga an sinthawna sengah an rawngbâwl dân ding ka ruotpêk a;"
31,"and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.","a hun ruot senga thing inhlân ding le thlai thar hmasa tak ta ding dâmin. Aw ka Pathien, a ṭha tiengin mi hre zing rawh khai."
