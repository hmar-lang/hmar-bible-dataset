1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,","Hakalia naupa Nehemia thuhai chu: Hieng ang hi a hung na, kum sâwmhnina, Kisleu thlaa, Susa khawpuia ka um laiin,"
2,"that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.","ka unaupa pakhat Hanani le Juda rama inthawka mi ṭhenkhat an hung a; chun, Judahai sala intâng suok tahai chanchin le Jerusalem chanchin kân dawn a."
3,"And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.","Ka kuoma chun, “Sala intâng suok tah, chu rama dama la umhai chu chan setak le hrilsietin an um a; chun, Jerusalem kul chu a chim rem rum tah a, a kawtkhârhai khawm a kâng a,” an tih a."
4,"And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,","Chuong thu chu ka hriet chun ka ṭhung chawt a, ka ṭap a; ni ieng zât amani chu lungngaiin ka um a; chun, bu ka nghei a, vân Pathien hmaa chun ka ṭawngṭai a;"
5,"and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:","“Aw LALPA, vân Pathien, Pathien ropui le ṭium, nangma hma- ngaia i thupêk pawmtuhai chunga thuthlung hlena lunginsietna suk- langtu,"
6,"let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father’s house have sinned:","Israel thlahai suolna, i chunga kan suolna thupha ka chawi sûng hin i na lo sit la; i mit lo meng la, i siehlaw ṭawngṭaina, i kuoma a sûn a zâna i siehlaw Israel thlahai ka ngênpêkna hi lo ngaithlapêk la; kei le ka pa sûnghai chu kan lo suol ta sih a."
7,"we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.","I chungah ṭha lotakin thil kan lo thaw tah a, i siehlaw Mosie kuoma i pêk, thupêkhai, dânhai, rorêlhai chu kan lo zâwm ta si nawh a."
8,"Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:","I siehlaw Mosie kuoma, ‘In baw- siet chun hnam tin laia chun sukdar ka ti cheu a;"
9,"but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.","amiruokchu, keia tieng in hung ngha nâwk a, ka thupêkhai in pawm a, in zâwm chun, nangni laia mi kâwlkawdawng chena hnawt suoka um khawm um hai sienla, chutaka inthawk khawm chun kei khâwm nâwk ka ti cheu a, ka hming ka înumtirna ding hmuna ka ruota chun ṭhuoi nâwk ka tih,’ tiha thu i pêk kha lunginsiettakin hre zing rawh."
10,"Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.","Chun, hienghai hi i siehlawhai le i mihai, i thilthawtheina nasatak le i kut thahrâta în tlan suokhai an na."
11,"O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.","Aw LALPA, lunginsiettakin i siehlaw ṭawngṭaina le i hming ṭi lâwm zâwnga nei, i siehlawhai ṭawngṭainaa hin i na lo sit ta; chun, vawisûn hin i siehlaw hi mîn hlawtlingtir la, hi mi mithmua hin lunginsiettakin zângaina indawngtir rawh,” ka tih a. Kei chu lal no inhlântu ka ni sih a."
