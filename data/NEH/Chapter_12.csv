26,"These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe.","Hienghai hi Jesua, Jozadak naupa Joiakim dam laia mi le ram awptu Nehemia le Ezra, thiempu le lakhaziektu dam laia mi an nih."
27,"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.","Jerusalem kul an inhlânnaa chun dârbenthekhai, perkhuonghai, ṭingṭanghai le hla sak le, lâwmthu hril lâwmtaka an inhlânnaa ṭhang dinga Jerusalema hung ṭhuoi dingin Levi mihai chu an hmun po poa in- thawk chun an zawng suok a."
28,"And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;","Jerusalem kâwl vêl le, Neto- phath mihai khuohaia inthawk dâmin hla sak hotu nauhai chu an fe khâwm a;"
29,"also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.","Beth-gilgal le, Geba le, Azma- veth rama inthawk dâm khâwmin hlasaktuhai chun Jerusalem vêla chun khuo an lo siem tâwl ta sih a."
30,"And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.","Chun, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu an insukthieng a, chun, mipui- hai, kulhai, a kawtkhârhai an suk- thieng a."
31,"Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:","Chuongchun, Judahai mi lien- hai chu kul chunga chun ka hang ṭhuoi a; lâwmthu hril inzui nghuon nghuon ding pâwl lientak pâwl hni ka ruot a; pâwl khat chu hmunhnawk kawtkhâr tieng, kul chung chang- tieng pangah an feh a;"
32,"and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,","chun, anni chu Hosaia le Juda mi lien zâtve hai;"
33,"and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,","Azaria, Ezra Mesullam,"
34,"Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,","Juda, Benjamin, Semaia, Jeremia,"
35,"and certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;","tawtawrâwt chawi thiempu nau ṭhenkhathai le, Asaph naupa Zakkur, chu naupa Mikaia, chu naupa Mattania, chu naupa Semaia, chu naupa Jonathan, chu naupa Zekaria hai;"
36,"and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.","a unau Semaia, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Juda, Pa- thien mi David sut hlak thilhai chawi Hanani hai chun an zui a; chun, lekhaziektu Ezra chun an hma a ṭhuoi a."
37,"And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.","Chun, tuikhur kawtkhâr an tlungin kul hang kai ṭannaa an hmazâwn David khaw kailâwna hang fein David in saka chun an feh a, saktieng panga Tui kawtkhâr tlung rakin."
38,"And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall,","Chun, lâwmthu hriltu pâwl danghai chu anni le intuok dingin vawi tieng pangah an feh a, chun, keiin mipui zâtve hai leh Meipui sepna Insâng sakah, kul chungah kullien chenin ka zui a,"
39,"and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.","Ephraim kawtkhâr chunga dâm, Kawtkhâr hluia dâm, nga kawt- khâra dâm, Hananel insânga dâm, Za insânga dâm, Beram kawtkhâr tlung rakin; chun, Vengtu kawtkhâra chun an ngîr a."
40,"So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;","Chuongchun, lâwm thu hril- tu pâwl hnihai chu Pathien inah an ngîr a, kei le rorêltu zâtve hai leh;"
41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;","chun, tawtawrâwt chawi thiem- puhai Eliakim, Maaseia, Miniamin, Mikaia, Elioenai, Zekaria le Hana- nia,"
42,"and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.","chun, Maaseia, Semaia, Elea- zar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkija, Elam le Ezer leh. Chun, hlasaktuhai chun an hotu Jezrahia rawiin inringtakin an sak a."
43,"And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.","Chu ni chun inthâwina nasatak an inhlân a, an hlim hle el a; Pa- thienin hlim namên loin a sukhlim a nih; chun, nuhmeihai le naupanghai chen khawmin an hlim hleh a; chuongchun, Jerusalem hlimna chu hlataka inthawk khawmin ân hriet a."
44,"And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.","Chun, chu ni chun thaw- lâwmhai, a thêna thêna thilinhlân dâm, thlai thar hmasa tak dâm, sâwma pakhat dâm, siekhâwmna pindanhaia hotu, dânin a ruot ang thiempu le Levi mihai chanvo khaw tin lohma izir ang pei la khâwmtu dinghai an ruot a; Judahai chu rawngbâwltu thiempu le Levi mihai lei chun an lâwm hleh a."
45,"And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.","An Pathien rawngbâwl dân ding le, insukthiengna dân chu an zâwm a, hlasaktuhai le kawtkhâr vengtuhai khawmin, David le a naupa Solomon thupêk ang chun."
46,"For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.","Tienlaia David le Asaph dam lai chun hlasak pâwl hotu an um hlak a, Pathien inpâkna hla le lâwmna hla an sak hlak a nih."
47,"And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.","Zerubbabel dam lai le, Nehemia dam lai chun Israel po poin hlasak- tuhai le kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu ni tina an tlâk tâwk ding chanvo an siempêk hlak a; chun, Levi mihai chu chanvo a suktumpêk bawk a; chun, anni Levi mihai chun Aron naupasal- hai chanvo chu an suktumpêk hlak a."
