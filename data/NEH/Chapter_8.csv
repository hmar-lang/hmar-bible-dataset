1,"And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.","Chun, mi po po chu lungril hmunkhatin Tui kawtkhâr zâwn hmun lienna laia chun an fe khâwm a; chun, lekhaziektu Ezra chu LALPAIN Israelhai zâwm dinga thu a pêk Mosie Dân bu chu hung chawi dingin an hril a."
2,"And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.","Chuongchun, thla sarina, ni khat niin thiempu Ezra chun pung- khâwmhai nutling, patling le a hrethiem thei chin po po hmaa chun Dân chu a hung chawi a."
3,"And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.","Chutaka mi chu Tui kawtkhâr hmazâwn hmun lienna laia chun nutling, patling le a hrethiem thei chinhai lai zîngtienga inthawkin sûn chenin a tiem a; mi po po chun Dân bu thua chun an na an sit ṭhuop el a."
4,"And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.","Chun, chuong ang dinga an siem hrim thing dawkân insânga chun lekhaziektu Ezra chu a ngîr a, a sir changtienga chun Mattithia, Sema, Anaia, Uria, Hilkia le Maaseia hai an ngîr a; chun, a vawitienga chun Pedaia, Misael, Malkija, Hasum, Hasbaddana, Zekaria le Mesullam an ngîr a."

6,"And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.","chuongchun, Ezra chun LALPA Pathien ropuitak chu ân pâk a; chun, mipui po po chun an bân pharin, “Amen, Amen,” tiin an lo dawn a; chun, an kûn a, an hmaia hnuoi sikin LALPA chu chibai an bûk a."
7,"Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.","Jesua, Bani, Serebia, Jamin, Akkub, Sabbethai, Hodia, Maaseia, Kelita, Azaria, Zojabad, Hanan, Pelaia, Levi mihai chun mipuihai kuomah Dân an hrilfie a: mipuihai chu an ngirhmuna chun an um zing a."
8,"And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.","Chun, Lekhabu Pathien Dân bua mi chu fietakin an tiem a; a umzie an hrilfieh a, chuongchun, an tiem chu an inhriettir pei a."
9,"And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.","Chun, ram awptu Nehemia le thiempu le lekhaziektu ni fâwm Ezra le mipuihai inchûktirtu Levi mihai chun mipui po po kuoma chun, “Vawisûn ni hi LALPA in Pathien ta dinga ni inthieng a nih; lungriemin thlâk naw sienla cheu, ṭap khawm ṭap bawk naw ro,” an tih a. Dân thu chu an hrietin mipui po po chu an ṭap an ṭap el sih a."
10,"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.","Chuongchun, ama chun an kuomah, “Fe unla, a thâu thâu fa unla, a thlum thlum dâwn unla, ieng- khawm buotsai nei lohai ta dingin chanpuol inphur unla, vawisûn ni hi ei LALPA ta dinga ni inthieng a ni hi; lungngaiin um naw ro, LALPA chunga lâwmna chu in hrâtna a ni sih a,” a ta."
11,"So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.","Chuongchun, Levi mihai chun, “To ṭawk ṭawk ro khai, vawisûn hi ni inthieng a ni sih a; lungngai khawm lungngai nuom naw ro,” tiin, mipui po po chu an sukto ta ṭhuop el a."
12,"And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.","Chuongchun, thu a hrilfie chu an hrietthiem leiin mipui po po chu fa ding dâmin, dâwn ding dâmin, mi dang chanpuol thawn ding dâmin, hlimtaka um ding dâm chun an ṭîn ta vawng a."
13,"And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers’ houses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.","Chun, a ni hni ni chun sûngkaw tinrênga a luhai dâm, thiempuhai dâm, Levi mihai chu Dân thu inchûk ding bawk chun lekhaziektu Ezra kuoma chun an fe khâwm a."
14,"And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie hmanga zâwm dinga thu a pêk dâna chun thla sarina ruoiṭhe laia Israel thlahai sâwlbûka an um ding thu le,"
15,"and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.","an ziek anga, “Tlângah fe unla, oliv kauhai, oliv hlêm kauhai le inhmui kauhai, intûm kauhai dâm, thing lien taktak kauhai chu sâwlbûk bâwlna dingin va la ro,” tiin an khuo po poa le, Jerusalem khuoa chun an hrildar ding thu le, phuong vêl ding a ni thu dâm chu an tiem a."
16,"So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.","Chuong ang chun mipuihai chu an va feh a, mi po poin an in chung- haia dâm, an kawthaia dâm, Pathien in kawta dâm, Tui kawtkhâr hmun lienna laia dâm, Ephraim kawtkhâr hmun lienna laia dâm sâwlbûk an bâwl seng a."
17,"And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.","Chun, sala suok pungkhâwm- hai po po chun sâwlbûk an siem a. Sâwlbûkhaia chun an um a; Nun naupa Josua chena inthawk tah, Israel nauhai chun chuong ang lâwm chun an la thaw ngai nawh a. Chuongchun, lâwmna nasatak a hung um tah a,"
18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the ordinance.",ni tin a ṭantir nia inthawka a tâwp chenin Pathien Dân bua mi an tiem bawk a. Ruoiṭhe chun ni sari an awh a; chun a ni riet ni chu thupêk anga a ṭumṭiekna ni chu a nih.
