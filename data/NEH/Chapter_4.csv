1,"But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.","Nisienlakhawm, Sanballat chun kul kan siem ṭha ti a hriet chun, nasatakin a lunginsen a, a lungawi ta nawh a, Judahai chu a dêusâw tah a."
2,"And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?","Chuongchun, a unauhai le Samari sipaihai hmaa chun thu a hril a, “Hieng Juda mi hrâtlohai hin ieng am a ni leh an thaw? An inkul pui- tling vei ding am a ni ie? An inthâwi vei ding am a nih? Ni khat thil thuin an puitlin ding maw? Hmunhnawk um khâwm mei meia inthawk le lung kâng se ta sa an inngîr thartir ding maw?” a tih a."
3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.","Chun, a kâwla Ammon mi Tobia chun, “Hang inngîrtir hrim raw hai se chu, sihal khawm hang lâwn sien an lung kul chu sukchim el a tih,” a tih a."
4,"Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;","Aw kan Pathien, en ta, hmusitin kan um hi, an mi hrilsietna chu anni lu chunga ngei inlêttir la, anni khawm khâwlai rama manih muol- photakin intângtir zing rawh;"
5,"and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.","an bawsietnahai chu inkhum naw la, an suolnahai chu i hmaa inthawka thaihmangin inumtir naw rawh; kul siemtuhai hmaah an suk- lungsen che hi."
6,So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half the height thereof: for the people had a mind to work.,"Chuongchun, kul chu kan siem a, ân sâng tieng chenvein kul po po chu kan zawm suok vawng a; mipuihai chun thaw inhâwkna lungril chu an put hle a."
7,"But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;","Amiruokchu, Sanballat hai, Tobia hai, Arab mihai, Ammon mihai le Asdod mihaiin kul chu siem ṭhat a ni pei ti an hriet chun an lunginsen ta hle el a;"
8,"and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.","chuongchun, Jerusalem chu hung thawa buoina siem chu an rawt tâwl tah a."
9,"But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.","Nisienlakhawm, anni lei chun kan Pathien kuomah kan ṭawngṭai a, sûn le zânah anni chu a vêngtu ding kan sie zing a."
10,"And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.","Chun, Juda chun, “Sinthaw- tuhai tha hlak a châu zo tah a, hmunhnawk hlak a nasa sih a; kul chu ei siem thei ta naw ding a ni hi,” a tih a."
11,"And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.","Kan hmêlmahai hlak chun, “Anni lai ei hang feh a, ei hang that a, sin chu ei hang suktâwppêk hmakhat chun hre naw ni hai a, mi hmu bawk naw ni hai,” an lo ti bawk a."
12,"And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.","An kuoma Juda umhai an hung hlak khan hmun tum tuma miin vawi sâwm zet, “Kan kuomah in hung nâwk ding a nih,” an mi lo ti zawm- zawt bawk a."
13,"Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set there the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.","Chuleichun, kul phên, ân hnuoi- na lai tak, hmun inthâwlna fai laia chun mipuihai chu a sûng sûngin an kâwlhnâmhai, an feihai, an thal- ngulhai chawiin ṭhanghmun kân khuortir a."
14,"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.","Chun, ka hang en vêl a, ka tho a, mi ṭhahai le rorêltuhai le mi danghai kuoma chun, “Anni chu ṭi dêr naw unla, LALPA ropuitak le, ṭiumtak el chu hre zingin in unauhai, in nau- pasalhai, in naunuhmeihai, in nu- hmeihai, in inhai hum dingin thaw ro khai,” ka tih a."
15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.","Chun, kan hmêlmahai chun kan lo hriet ti le, an thil thaw tum chu Pathienin teploah a siem ti an hrietin, kul tieng mâni sinthawna sengah kan fe nâwk tâwl tah a."
16,"And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.","Chutaka inthawk chu ka mihai a zâtve chun sin chu an thaw nâwk tah a; a zâtve danghai chun feihai, phawhai, thalngulhai, âwmphaw- hai chu an kawl a; chun rorêltuhai chu Juda sûnghai hnunga chun an um a,"
17,"They that builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;","chuong bang siemtuhai hnunga chun. Chun, chuong phurrik phur- tuhai chu an inbel rik ṭeu a, an kut khingkhatin sin an thawh a, khing- tiengin hriemhrei an chawi a;"
18,"and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.","a siemtuhai chun an kâwlhnâm an pâi seng a, chuong pum chun an siem a nih. Tawtawrâwt mûttu chu keia kâwlah a um a."
19,"And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:","Chun, mi ṭhahai le rorêltuhai le mipuihai hmaa chun, “Sin hi a nasain a lien êm a, kula hin ei inhlatin ei indar hle el sih a;"
20,"in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.","tawtawrâwt ri in hrietna hmun hmuna chun keini kuom tieng hung tlân khâwm unla; ei Pathien chun mi dopêk a tih,” ka tih a."
21,So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.,"Chuong ang chun sin chu kan thawh a, chun, a zâtve chun vârṭiena inthawka arasi inlang chen feihai chu an kawl zing a."
22,"Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.","Chuong ang bawkin chuong lai chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “Zâna mi vênga, sûna sin thaw dingin tu- khawm an siehlawhai leh Jerusalem sûngah riek vawng raw hai se,” ka tih a."
23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one went with his weapon to the water.","Chuongchun, kei khawm, ka unauhai khawm, ka tlangvâlhai khawm, vêngtu a mi zui hlakhai khawm, tukhawma kan silfên kan hlîp hrim hrim nawh a, hriemhrei inbel pum zingin tui tienga chun kan fe hlak a nih."
