1,Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.,"Chun, mipuihai le an nuhmeihai chu an unau Judahai chunga chierin an khêk ta mur mur el a,"
2,"For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.","“Eini rawi hi ei naupasalhai le ei naunuhmeihai leh tam tâwk tak ei na; bu hi inchûin inchû el ei tiu, ei fâka ei hring theina dingin,” ti dâm an um a."
3,"Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.","Chun, ṭhenkat, “Ei lohai, ei inhai, ei grêp huonhai hrên dingin ei sie sih a, ṭâm lei hin bu hi ân chûin inchû el ei tiu,” ti dâm khawm an um bawk a."
4,"There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute upon our fields and our vineyards.","“Ei lohai, ei grêp huonhai hrên dinga siein lal kuoma dâm sie chawi dingin sum dâm ei pûk a."
5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.","Ei taksa chu ei unauhai taksa ang bawk a na; ei nauhai khawm an nauhai ang bawk an ni sih a; nisienla- khawm, hi, ei naunuhmeihai, ei naupasalhai hi siehlawa um dingin suokah ei inlûttir takngiel ding a ni hi; ei naunuhmei ṭhenkhat lem chu suokah an lût ta nghe ngheh a, san ngaina hre nghâl lo me; mihaiin ei huonhai le ei grêp huonhai chu an nei ta sih a,” ti dâm an um nuol bawk a."
6,And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.,Chuong thuhai le an rihâu chu ka hrietin ka lunginsen êm êm el a.
7,"Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.","Chuongchun, ka lungrilin ka ngaituo a, mi ṭhahai le rorêltuhai chu ka khak a, an kuomah, “Mi tinin in unauhai a pung hnawtin sum in inpûktir zing el a,” ka tih a. Chun, an chungchâng chu ngaituo dingin mi ka ko khâwm ṭeu el a."
8,"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.","An kuomah, “Hnam dang kuoma zawra um ei unau Judahai chu ei thei ang angin ei intlan a; nangni hin in unauhai hi zawr in tum a ni maw? Nangni kuoma ngei hin zawr an ni ding a ni maw?” ka tih a. Chuong- chun, an to zing a, dawnna ding ieng- khawm an hriet nawh a."
9,"Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?","“In thil thaw hi a ṭha naw tawp el a nih: ei hmêlma, hnam danghai mi hrilsietna lei hin ei Pathien chu ṭiha in um a ṭûl a ni naw am a nih?"
10,"And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.",Kei le ka unauhai le ka mihai khawmin kan sum le bu kan inpûktir ve bawk in sawnnaw. A pung hnawta inpûktir hi bân dai ei tiu khai.
11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.","Vawisûn ngei hin an lohai, an grêp huonhai, an oliv huonhai, an inhai le, an sum le an bu le an uoin le hriek hmun zaa hmun khat in lâk hlak khawm chu, pe nâwk vawng ro khai,” ka ti bawk a."
12,"Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.","Chuongchun, anni chun, “Pe nâwk vawng kan tih, annia inthawk- in iengkhawm phût naw ning ungah; i ti ang tak chun thâwng kan tih,” an tih a. Chuongchun, thiempuhai ka ko a, an hmaah chu thutiem ang taka thaw ngei ding chun kân khâmtir a."
13,"Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.","Ka dierkei chu ka thin a, “Hi thutiem anga thaw naw taphawt chu Pathien chun a ina inthawk le a sin- thawa inthawkin hieng ang hin thinthla raw se; hieng anga thin thlâkin um sienla, sukruokin um raw se,” ka tih a. Chun, a pungkhâwmhai po po chun, “Amen,” an tih a, Lalpa an inpâk a. Chun, mipuihai chun chu thutiem ang chun an thaw tah a."
14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.","Chu naw khawm chu Juda rama anni awptu dinga ruot ka ni china inthawk, lal Artazerzia kum sâwmhni ân lal kuma inthawka kum sâwmthum pahni ân lal kum chen, kum sâwm pahni sûng chun kei le ka unauhai hin ram awptu puol bei hrim hrim khawm kan fâk ngai nawh a."
15,"But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.","Nisienlakhawm, kha hmaa ram awptu ka hmaa lo umhai chu mihai chungah lu an lo ling hleh a, tangka shekel sâwmli tiem loin an beihai le uoinhai an lâkpêk hlak a; a chu nâksapah an siehlawhai chu mihai chunga chun an insuklal hle hlak a; amiruokchu, kei chun chu Pathien ṭina leiin chuong ang chun ka thaw ve nawh."
16,"Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.","Anih, hi kul sin thaw hin ka um zing a, ram hrim hrim inchâwk khawm kân châwk nawh a: ka mihai po po khawm sin chu thawin chutaka chun an um khâwm zing a nih."
17,"Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.",Chu chau khawm chu ni loin kan vêla hnam danghai laia inthawk- a hunghai tiem loin Judahai le rorêl- tuhai laia mi ka dawkâna awt hlak mi za le sâwmnga an um zing a nih.
18,"Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.","Chun, ni khat dinga an buotsai chu sebâwngchal pakhat le berâm paruk a ṭha ṭhieu a na; chun, ârhai khawm ka ta dingin an buotsai a, ni sâwm dan peiah uoin hran hran tam tâwk tak leh; chuong ang chun buot- sai hai sienla khawm hieng mihai tuor hi a rik êm leiin ram awptu puol bei chu ka phût naw hrim hrim a nih."
19,"Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.","Aw ka Pathien, hieng mihai ta dinga ka thilthawhai po po hi ka ṭhatna dingin hre zing rawh aw."
