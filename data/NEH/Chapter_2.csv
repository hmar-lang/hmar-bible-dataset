1,"And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.","Chun, lal Artazerzia kum sâwm- hni ân lal kum, Nisan thlaah uoin an hung pêk hnung chun, uoin chu ka lâk a, lal chu ka pêk a. Kha hma khan chu a hmaa hin lungngai hmêl ka la put ngai nawh a;"
2,"And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid.","lal chun ka kuomah, “I damnaw khawm chu a ni si nawh a, iengtiziea lungngai hmêl i put am a na? thil dang ni naw nih, i lungril a lungngai a ni hi maw,” a mi tih a. Chuongchun, ka ṭi ta êm êm el a."
3,"And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?","Kei chun lal kuoma chun, “Lal chu kumkhuoin dam raw se; a mi thlatuhai thlân umna khuo chu a ram tah a, a kawtkhârhai chu a kâng vawng ta sih a, lungngai hmêl put lo thei am nîng ka ti?” ka tih a."
4,"Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.","Chuongchun, lal chun ka kuom- ah, “Ieng am a na i hni chu?” a tih a. Chuongchun, vân Pathien kuoma chun ka ṭawngṭai tah a."
5,"And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.","Chun, lal kuoma chun, “Lal remti zâwng a nih a, i siehlaw hin i mit ka lo tlung hlak a ni chun, Juda ramah a mi thlatuhai thlân umnaa chun mîn fetir la; khuo chu va siemthar nâwk ka tih,” ka tih a."
6,"And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.","Lal chun ka kuomah, (lalnu khawm chu a kâwla chun a ṭhung ve a), “Ieng chen am va thang i ta, ieng tik am hung nâwk i ta?” a tih a. Chuongchun, lal chun lâwmtakin a mîn fetir tah a, kei khawm chun hunbi ka tiem bawk a."
7,"Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah;","Chu bak khawm chu ni loin lal kuoma chun, “Lal remti zâwng a ni chun, vadung râla rorêltuhai inhmu- tir dingin, Juda ram ka tlung chen an mîn fetir theina dingin phalna lekha mi pe la;"
8,"and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.","chun, lal ramhâk vêngtu Asaph inhmutir dingin invêngna kulbîng kawtkhâr kal ding le, khawpui kul ding dâmin, ka va hluo ding ina hmang ding dâmin thing a mi pêk theina dingin lekha mi pe bawk rawh,” ka tih a. Chun, ka Pathien mi ditsakna ang peiin lal chun a mi pêk tah a."
9,"Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.","Chuongchun, vadung râla rorêl- tuhai kuom chu ka va tlung a, lal lekhahai chu ka pêk a. Chun,lal chun ka kuoma chun sipai hotuhai le sipai sakawr chung chuong mihai ân fetir ve a nih."
10,"And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.","Chun, Horon mi Sanballat le Ammon mi siehlaw, Tobia haiin an lo hriet chun, Israel thlahai thawveng- na ding ngaituo dingin mi an hung a ni chu tie tiin an lo lungninaw hle el a."
11,"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.","Chuongchun, Jerusalem chu ka hang tlung a, ni thum ka hei um phawt a."
12,"And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.","Chun, zâna chun ka tho a, kei le mi dang tlâwmtêhai le chun: Jeru- salem ta dinga ka thaw ding, ka Pathienin ka lungrila a sie chu tu- khawm ka hril nawh a; ka chuongna sa ngawt naw chu sa dang ka kuoma um a um nawh a."
13,"And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.","Zâna chun Ruom kawtkhâra chun ka suok a, Dragon Tuisunsuo tieng le Hmunhnawk kawtkhâr tienga chun ka feh a; Jerusalem kul chimhai le a kawtkhâr kânghai chu ka en vêl a."
14,Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.,"Chun, Tuisunsuo kawtkhâr le lal Dîl chen chun ka feh a, nisien- lakhawm, ka chuongna sa a fethleng- na ding hrim hrim a um nawh a."
15,"Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.","Chuongchun, zânah vadung chu a tungin ka zui a, kul chu ka en a; chun, ka lêt nâwk a, Ruom kawt- khâra chun ka lût a, chuong ang chun ka hung kîr nâwk tah a."
16,"And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.","Rorêltuhai chun khâwlai am ka fe a, ieng am a na ka thaw ti khawm chu an hriet nawh a; chun, Judahai, thiempuhai, mi ṭhahai, rorêltuhai le mi dang sin thawtu ding hrim hrim khawm ka la hril hri naw bawk a."
17,"Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.","Chuongchun, an kuomah, “Ei chan a sietzie hi in hmu a, Jerusalem a ram ti dâm, a kawtkhârhai khawm a kâng ti khawm in hriet a; thaw ro, hrilsiet ei ni ta nawna dingin Jerusalem kul hi inngîr nâwk ei tiu,” ka tih a."
18,"And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good work.","Chun, ka Pathienin a mi ditsak thuhai dâm chu ka hril a, ka kuoma lal thuhrilhai le chun. Anni chun, “Tho ei ta, inngîr takluong ei tiu khai,” an tih a. Chuongchun, chu sin ṭha thaw ding chun an kut an sukhrât a."
19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?","Amiruokchu, Horon mi San- ballat le Ammon mi siehlaw Tobia le Arab mi Gesemin an hriet chun, an mi nuisan a, an mi hmusit a, “In thil thaw hi iengtizie am a na? Lal chungah in hel am a nih?” dâm an tih a."
20,"Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.","Chun, anni chu ka dawn a, an kuomah, “Vân Pathien chun mi suktluongtlung a ta; chuongchun, keini a siehlawhai chu tho kan ta, inngîr kan tih; nangni ruok chun Jerusalema hin chanvo amanih, thuneina amanih, hnûhma amani khawm in nei naw hrim hrim a nih,” ka tih a."
