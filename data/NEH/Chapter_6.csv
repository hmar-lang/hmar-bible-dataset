1,"Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),","Chun, Sanballat le Tobia le Arab mi Gesem le kan hmêlma dang hrim hrimhaiin kulhai ka siem a, a chimna lai hrim hrim a um ta nawh ti an hang hriet chun, (amiruokchu, chuong lai chun kawthaia chun kawt- khârhai chu ka la rem nawh a),"
2,"that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.","Sanballat le Gesem chun, “Hung la, Ono phaia khuo pakhatah intuok khâwm ei tiu,” tiin thu an mi hung inphur a. Nisienlakhawm, ka chunga thil ṭha naw thaw tum an lo ni zing a."
3,"And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?","Kei chun an kuomah, “Sin ropui- tak ka thawh a, ka hung thla thei nawh, ieng dingin am in kuoma ka hung thlâk kârin sin chu châwl el a ta?” tiin mi ka tir a."
4,And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.,"Chuong ang ruok chun vawi li thu an hung inphur a, chuong ang ruok chun kei khawma ka dawn a."
5,"Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,","Chuongchun, Sanballat chun chuong ang bawk chun a vawi nganaa chun a siehlaw chu lekha châr loa chawiin ka kuomah a hung tir a;"
6,"wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.","chutaka chun, “Nang le Judahai hin hel in lungril a, chuleiin, kul chu i siem a nih ti thu hnam danghai lai chun ân thang a, Gesem khawm hin a hril bawk a; chun, an hril pei dâna chun nang hi an lal ding i ni âwm a."
7,"And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.","Chun, ‘Juda rama chun lal a um,’ tiha i chanchin Jerusalema hril vêl dingin zâwlnei khawm i ruot hiel ta bawk a; hieng thu hi lal kuoma chun hril vak ngei an ta. Chuleiin, hung la, lo inrâwn ei ti khai,” ti hi a chuong a."
8,"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.","Chuongchun, a kuomah, “I hril ang hrim hrim hin iengkhawm thaw a um nawh, i phuokfâwm el a ni hi,” tiin mi ka tir a."
9,"For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.","“An sinthaw chu an puitling thei nawna dingin an kuthai chu suk- sietin um a tih,” tiha mi hrilṭi nuom ruok an nih. Chuongchun, aw Pathien, ka kuthai hi mi hung suk- hrâtpêk rawh aw."
10,"And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.","Chu hnunga chun Mehetabel nau Delaia naupa Semaia, insuk- tumpa ina chun ka feh a; ama chun, “Pathien inah, biekin sûng ngeiah inhmûng ei ti khai; biekin kawtkhâr- hai chu khâr tlat ei ta; nangma that ding chein an hung ding a nih, zânah a nih that ding chea an hung nghe nghe ding chu,” a lo tih a."
11,"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.","Kei ruok chun, “Keia ang hi hang tlânse el ding khawm am ka nih? Mâni hringna humhim nuom chun tu am biekina chun lût an ta? Lût dêr naw ning,” ka tih a."
12,"And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.","Chun, ka hang hriet dawk a, Pathien tir a lo ni dêr da el a; keima mi dodâlin chuong thu chu a hril a lo ni lem a, Tobia le Sanballatin an ruoi a lo ni zing a."
13,"For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.","Ka ṭi a, chuong anga ka thaw a, thil ka suksuol a, a mi sukhming- sietna ding an nei theina dingin a nih an ruoi chu."
14,"Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.","Aw ka Pathien, Tobia le Sanbal- lat hi an thilthaw ang pei hin hre zing rawh, zâwlneinu Noadia le zâwlnei dang mi sukṭi tumtuhai po po le hin."
15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.","Chuongchun, kul chu ni sâwm- nga le ni hniah, Elul thla ni sâwmhni panga niin zo a ni tah a."
16,"And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.","Chun, kan hmêlmahai po poin chu chu an lo hriet chun, kan vêla hnam danghai chun an ṭi tah a, chan se ta hlein an inhriet a, sin chu kan Pathien thaw a nih ti an hriet ta sih a."
17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.","Chu naw hrima khawm, chuong lai chun Juda mi ṭhahai chun Tobia chu lekha tamtak an inphur hlak a; chun, Tobia lekha khawm an hmu bawk hlak."
18,"For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.","Ama chu Ara naupa Sekania mâkpa a ni leiin, Juda rama mi tam- tak inkhâm hiela ama inthuruolpui an um a; chun, a naupa Jehohanan chun Berekia naupa Mesullam naunu chu nuhmeiah a nei a nih."
19,"Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.","Ka hrieta chun a thilthaw ṭhahai chu an hril hlak a, ka thu hrilhai a kuoma chun an intlun bawk hlak. Chuongchun, Tobia chun mîn ṭhi dingin lekha dâm chu a hung thawn hlak a nih."
