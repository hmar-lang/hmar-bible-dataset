31,"and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.","chu rama mihaiin châwlniha thil zawr ding thuomhnaw amanih, fâk ding hrim hrim zawr amanih an hung lâk a, châwlnia manih, umni inser nia maniha inchawpêk lo a; kum sarinaa ram sielui a, leiba po po ṭhin lo dingin."

39,"For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the heave-offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.","Israel thlahai le Levi thlahai chun bu le uoin le hriek a thêna thêna thilinhlân hmun inthieng bûr-le-bêl le rawngbâwltu thiempuhai, kawt- khâr vêngtuhai dâm, hlasaktuhai umna pindana chun an sie ding a nih; chuong ang chun a nih, kan Pathien in chu thlathlam lo dinga dân kan insiempêk chu."
