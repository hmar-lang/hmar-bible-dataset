1,"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,",Paula Isu Krista mi intâng le ei unaupa Timothe chun:
2,"and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:","Kan dittak le kan sininrimpui Philemon kuoma dâm, kan farnu Aphi kuoma dâm, kan sipaipui Arkippa kuoma dâm, i ina kohran inkhâwmhai kuoma dâm:"
3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
4,"I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,",Ka ṭawngṭainahaia chun i hming lam rawpin ka Pathien kuoma chun lâwmthu ka hril hlak a.
5,"hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;",Lalpa Isu tieng le mi inthienghai po po tiengah hmangaina le ringna i nei chu hre zingin;
6,"that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.","i ringna mîn ṭâwmpuina chu nangnia um thil ṭha tinrêng hriet famkimna kawnga chun, Krista tienga a ṭhathnem theina dingin;"
7,"For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.","unaupa, nangma zâra mi in- thienghai lungril a har ta leiin i hma- ngainaa chun ka hlimin ka thla- muong bêk bêk a nih."
8,"Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,","Chuleiin, a âwmtâwk chu thaw dinga thupêk chu Kristaa chun ngam bêk bêk lang khawm,"
9,"yet for love’s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:","hmangaina leiin (Paula tarsie rau ka nih, tuhin Krista mi intâng ka lo ni ta nâka chu) a ngênin ka ngên lem che,"
10,"I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,","ka nau Onesima, kawl bun puma ka inei ta ding hin i kuomah ka ngênpêk a nih."
11,"who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:","Ama chu inhma khan i ta dingin a ṭangkai nawh a, tu ruok hin chu kei le nanga ta dingin a ṭangkai."
12,"whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:","Ama ngei, ka lungril ngei hi, i kuomah ka hung tir kîr nâwk a nih:"
13,"whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:","ama chu Chanchin Ṭhaa kawl ka bunnaa hin nanga aia rawng a mi bâwlpêk theina dingin ka kuoma inumtir zing ka nuom hleh a,"
14,"but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.","nisienlakhawm, i lungsietna chu lunginsiet luitir ang ni loin, i thu ang a ni thei lemna dingin i thu naw chun iengkhawm ka thaw nuom nawh."
15,"For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;",Sâwt nawtê a ṭhe che hi kum- khuoa ama chu i nei sawngna ai a ni lem rawi mawh;
16,"no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.","ama chu suok ang ni loa, suok nêka ṭha, unau dittak ang lemin ka ta dingin dittak a ni bîk a, nanga ta ding lem chun tisaa le Lalpaa chun a va ni nâwk zuol âwm de!"
17,"If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.","Chuongchun, ruola i mi ngai chun keia angin ama hi lo lâwm la."
18,"But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account;","Chun, i chungah iengkhawm suksuolin amanih, i iengkhat amanih a bat chun keia batah ruot rawh."
19,"I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.","Kei Paulain keima kut ngeia ka ziek a ni hi; keiin thung pêk ka tih, ka kuoma nangma ngei khawm în batzie hril che lem chu ka ni nawh."
20,"Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.","Anih, unaupa, nanga leiin Lalpaa chun mîn lâwmtir la, Kristaa chun ka lungril sukhar rawh."
21,"Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.","Ka hril nêka nasa lem hmanin thâwng i tih ti ka hriet leiin, i awi ringin i kuomah ka ziek a nih."
22,But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.,"Iengkhawm ni sienla, chu chau chu thaw loin, tlungin ding khawm mi lo buotsaipêk bawk la, in ṭawngṭainahai leiin in kuomah pêk ka ni ding a nih ti ka ring sih a."
23,"Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;","Epaphra, Krista Isua ka in- tângpuipa hin chibai a bûk che:"
24,"and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.","ka sinthawpui Marka hai, Aristarka hai, Dema hai, Luka hai khawmin chuong ang bawkin an bûk che."
25,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.,Ei Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna in thlarau kuomah um raw se. Amen.
