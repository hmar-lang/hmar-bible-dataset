3,"Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.",Krista Isu sipai ṭhatak angin rinum mi tuorpui rawh.
4,No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.,"Sipaia um dinga thlangtu chu a suklâwm theina dingin, sipai tû- khawm indo laiin hi dam sûng khawsakna hin ân sukhnawk ngai nawh a."
5,"And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.","Chun, in ruolsieknahaia khawm chun mîn thaw sien khawm, dân angin a thaw naw chun inkhumtirin a um ngai nawh a."

8,"Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:","Isu Krista, David thlaa mi ka Chanchin Ṭha hril anga mithi laia inthawka thonâwk kha, hre zing rawh."
9,"wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.","Chu Chanchin Ṭha lei chun thil suksuoltu angin khuop hiel khawpin rinumhai ka tuor hlak a nih; nisienlakhawm, Pathien thu chu khuopin a um si nawh."

11,"Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:","Hi thu hi ring a um a nih; “Ama leh ei thi ta si chun, Ama leh hring bawk ei tih;"
12,"if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:","Ei tuor chun, Ama leh ro rêl ei tih; Ama ei inphat chun, Ama khawmin mîn phat a tih;"
13,"if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.","Eini ringum loin um inla khawm, Ama chu ringumin a um zing a nih; Ama le ama ân phat thei si nawh a,” ti hi."
14,"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.","Chuong thu chu inhriet thartir zing la, thu mei meiah an insêl nawna dingin Lalpa mithmuah ṭhahnem- ngaitakin inhriettir rawh, chu chu iengkhawm a ṭhahnem nawh a, a ngaituhai ta dingin bohmangna a ni lem hlak."
15,"Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.","Sinthawtu mâni sinthaw inzâ- pui ngai nawtu angin, Pathien thutak indiktaka inchûktirin, Pathien pawm tlâka um dingin i theitâwp suo rawh."
16,"But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,","Amiruokchu, Pathien inza nawna tieng thu hril mei mei chu nghatsan hlak rawh; chuong ang mi chu Pathien ngâisak nawna tiengah nasa nâwk zuol an ta,"
17,and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus;,"an thu khawm chun pânse fâk angin fa pei a tih, anni lai chun Humenai le Philet an ṭhang a nih."
18,"men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.","Chuong mihai chun, “Tho- nâwkna chu tu khawm hin a ni dai tah,” tiin, thutak kawng chu an fe kâwisan a, mi ṭhenkhathai ringna an sukbo hlak."
19,"Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien lung- phûm nghet chu a la ngîr zing a, hi inchikna hi a nei a, “Lalpa chun ama tahai chu a hriet,” ti le, “Lalpa hming lam taphawt chun suol fe san raw se,” ti hi."
20,"Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.","Nisienlakhawm, in ropuia hin bûr le bêl rângkachak le tangkaruoa siem chau a um nawh a, thing le bepila siem khawm a um hlak a; ṭhenkhathai ngaihlut ding a um bawk a, ṭhenkhathai chu ngaihlut naw ding a um bawk."
21,"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work.","Chuleiin, miin chuong thilhaia inthawk ân siekieng chun, bêl in- thieng, Lalpa hmang tlâk, sin thaw ṭha tinrênga in zosa, ngaihlut ding mi nîng a tih."
22,"But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.","Nisienlakhawm, tleirâwl châk- nahai chu tlânsan la, lungril in- thienga Lalpa lam taphawthai kuom- a chun felna dâm, ringna dâm, hmangaina dâm, inremna dâm hnawt ve rawh."
23,"But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.","Amiruokchu, indona a siem hlak ti hrein, insêlna invêt le, var nawahai chun ṭhang nuom naw."
24,"And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,","Lalpa suok chun do ding a ni si nawh a, mi po po chungah zaidamin, inchûktir thiemin, suol chungah dâwtheiin,"
25,"in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,","ama do dinga insiemhai chu thuhnuoirawl takin ân chûktir lem ding a nih; chuongchun, sima thutak an hung hriet theina dingin Pathienin hun remchâng a pêk el thei a nih;"
26,"and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.","Pathien dit zâwng thaw dingin Lalpa suoka manin, Diebol chânga inthawkin an suok thei hlau rawi mawh."
