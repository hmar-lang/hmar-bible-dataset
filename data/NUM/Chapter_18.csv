1,"And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers’ house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.","LALPA chun Aron kuomah, “Nang le i nâupasalhai le in sûngkuo hin hmun inthieng khaw- hlona maw chu phur in ta; chun, nang le i naupasalhai hin in thiempu nina khawhlona maw chu phur bawk in tih."
2,"And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.","Chun, Levi chi, i pa chi, i unau- haiin an zawm ve cheh a, i rawng an bâwl theina dingin i kâwl hnaiah inumtir la, amiruokchu, nang le i naupasalhai chu thuinhriettirna puon in bulah in um ding a nih."
3,"And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.","I sina chun ṭhangpui an ti cheh a, puon in tieng sin po po chu chang an ta, amiruokchu, hmun inthieng bûrlebêl le mâichâm chu hung hnai naw raw hai se, an thi nawna dingin, anni amanih, nang amani khawm."
4,"And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.","Anni chun inkawppui an ti che a, puon in rawngbâwlna po poah in- tuokna puon in sin chu chang an ta, hnam dang chun an hung hnai ding cheu a ni nawh."
5,"And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.",Nang chun hmun inthieng sin le mâichâm sin chu chang i ta; Israel thlahai chunga lunginsenna a um nawna dingin.
6,"And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.","Chun, ngai ta, kei hin i unau Levi mihai chu Israel thlahai laia in- thawkin ka thlang suok a, intuokna puon in rawngbâwl dinga LALPA kuoma pêk, i ta dinga thilpêk nîng an tih."
7,"And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.","Nang le i naupasalhai hin mâi- châm le puonzâr sûngtieng in thiempu sin chu thâwng in tih. Chun, nangin rawngbâwl i tih, thiempu sin hi in rawngbâwl sin dingin ka pêk cheu a nih; hnam dang hung inrawl ve phawt chu sukhlum nîng an tih,” a ta."
8,"And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.","Chun, LALPA chun Aron kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, kei hin ka ta dinga a thêna thên thilinhlân, Israel nauhai thilinhlânhai po po pumin nang le i naupasalhai ta dingin, kumkhuoa in chanpuol dingin ka pêk cheu a."
9,"This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.","Meia raw mahla thil inthienghai chu i ta nîng a ta; an thilinhlân tinrêng an beiphit thilinhlân dâm, an suol thâwina thilinhlân dâm, an thiemnaw thâwina thilinhlân ka kuoma an hung inhlân ding chen- in nang le i naupasalhai puol nîng a tih."
10,As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.,"Hmun inthieng takah fâng in ta, pasal po poin fâng in tih; in ta dingin inthieng nîng a tih."
11,"And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.","Hieng hi i chanpuol nîng a tih: beiphit thilinhlâna an thilpêk, Israel thlahai a thêna thên thilinhlân chenin, nang le i naupasalhai le i naunuhmeihai leh kumkhuoa in chanpuolah ka pêk cheu a nih, i ina mi inthieng po po chun fa thei an tih."
12,"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them.","Hriek ṭha tak dâm, grêp ṭha tak dâm, bu ṭha tak dâm, ra hmasa tak LALPA ta dinga an pêk chu ka pêk che."
13,"The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.","An loa ra hmin hmasa tak LALPA ta dinga an hung lâk chu i ta nîng a ta, i ina mi inthieng po po chun fa thei an ta,"
14,Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.,Israelhai thilinhlân po po chu i ta nîng a tih.
15,"Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.","LALPA ta dinga an pêk sul hung kêu hmasa tak chu ran khawm, mihriem khawm, i ta nîng a ta; amiruokchu, nau lutir chu în tlan ding a na, ran thieng naw tê hung pieng thla hmasa tak khawm în tlan ding a nih."
16,"And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).","Thla khat a ni chun intlan dinghai chu intlanna man i ruot angin hmun inthienga shekel hmang dân angin, shekel ngaa intlan ding a nih, (shekel chu gera sâwmhni a nih)."
17,"But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, bâwng pieng thla hmasa tak dâm, berâm pieng thla hmasa tak dâm, kêl pieng thla hmasa takhai chu în tlan ding a ni nawh a, an inthieng a nih, an thisen chu mâichâmah thêng i ta, LALPA ta dinga riminhnikah an thâuhai chu meia thilinhlânah i raw ding a nih."
18,"And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.","An sa chu i ta nîng a ta, a thêna thên thilinhlân ir le a mal changtieng i ta a ni ang hin."
19,"All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee.","Thil inthienga thên thilinhlân, Israel thlahaiin LALPA ta dinga an inhlânhai chu in kumkhaw chanpuol dingin ka pêk cheu a nih. LALPA hmaah nang le i naupasalhai le i naunuhmeihai le chatuon machi thuthlung a nih,” a ta."
20,"And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.","LALPA chun Aron kuomah, “An rama chun rochan nei naw ti niu a, anni lai chun chanvo nei naw bawk in tih: Israel thlahai laia i chanvo le i rochan chu keima hi ka nih."
21,"And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.","“Levi thlahai chu rawngbâwl sin, puon in rawngbâwl sina an sinthaw manah Israel rama sâwma pakhat po po hi ka pêk a nih."
22,"And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.",Tuta chen chu Israel thlahai chun intuokna puon in an hung hnai ding a ni nawh; suol maw phurin thi rawi an tih.
23,"But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.","Levi mihai ruok hin chu intuokna puon in rawngbâwl sin chu thâwng an ta, anni dân nîng a tih; chun, Israel thlahai laiah rochan nei naw ni hai."
24,"For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.","Israel thlahaiin sâwma pakhat LALPA ta dinga a thêna thên thilinhlâna chu Levi mihai rochan dingin ka pêk a nih; chuleiin, an kuomah, ‘Israel thlahai lai rochan nei naw ni hai,’ ka lo ti ta sa hrim a nih,” a ta."
25,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuomah,"
26,"Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.","“Chuong thua naw khawm chun Levi mihai chu hril la, an kuomah, ‘In rochan dinga Israel thlahai sâwma pakhat ka pêk cheu, annia inthawka in dawng pha chun, chu sâwma pakhata sâwma pakhat chu LALPA kuoma a thêna thên thilinhlân dingin in inhlân ding a nih."
27,"And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.","Chuongchun, in thên thilinhlân chu hrizâwla bu le i uoin sâwrnaa uoin anga ngai nîng a tih."
28,"Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah’s heave-offering to Aaron the priest.","Chuong ang chun Israel thlahai laia inthawka sâwma pakhat in dawng po poa mi chu LALPA ta dinga thên thilinhlâna dingin in inhlân ve pei ding a nih; chun, chu LALPA ta dinga thên thilinhlân chu thiempu Aron in pêk ding a nih."
29,"Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.","In thil dawng po poa mi chu a ṭha tak, ân thieng tak pei LALPA kuomah thên thilinhlânah in inhlân ding a nih."
30,"Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the winepress.","Chuleiin, an kuomah, Chutaka a ṭha tak in thên pha chun Levi mihai hrizâwla hung le uoin hung tlung anga ngai nîng a tih."
31,"And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.","Khâwlâi hmuna khawm fa thei in tih; nangni le in sûnghai khawma, intuokna puon ina in rawngbâwl man a ni sih a."
32,"And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.","A ṭha tak in thên chu a suol maw phur naw ti niu a, Israel thlahai thil inthieng chu sukpawrche naw ti niu a, in thi naw ding a nih,’ ti rawh,” a ta."
