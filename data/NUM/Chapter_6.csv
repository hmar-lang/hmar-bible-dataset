1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,","“Israel thlahai kuomah hril la, an kuomah, ‘Pasal amanih, nuhmei amani khawma ieng amanih thutiem bîk, LALPA ta dinga inpêkna Nazarit thutiem ân tiem ding lai chun,"
3,"he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.","uoin le zû a nghei ding a nih; uoin thûr amanih, zu thûr khawm a dâwn ding a ni nawh."
4,"All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk.","Ân suktum sûng po chun grêp hruia mi a laimu khawm, a hâwng khawm a fâk ding a ni nawh."
5,"All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in which he separateth himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.","Insuktumna thu ân tiem sûng po chun a lu khawm vâw dêr lo ding a nih. LALPA ta dinga insuktum ni a kim hmakhat chun suktum nîng a ta, a sam khawm a hla ding a nih."
6,All the days that he separateth himself unto Jehovah he shall not come near to a dead body.,LALPA ta dinga ân suktum sûng po chun mithi ruong khawm a hnai ding a ni nawh.
7,"He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation unto God is upon his head.","A pa hai, a nu hai, a unaupa hai, a farnu hai amanih thi thua khawm ân sukpawrche ding a ni nawh. Pathien ta dinga ân suktumna chun a khuop leiin."
8,All the days of his separation he is holy unto Jehovah.,“Ân suktum sûng po chun LALPA ta dinga inthieng a nih.
9,"And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.","A kâwlah mi hung thi ta thutin, ân suktumna lu chu lo sukpawrche ta ang sienla, a inthien ni, a ni sari ni chun a lu chu a vaw ding a nih."
10,"And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:","Chun, ni riet ni chun intuokna puon in kawtkhârah thiempu kuom- ah vaṭhu tuok khat amanih, pârvate tuok khat amanih a hung chawi ding a nih."
11,"and the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.","Thiempu chun pakhat chu suol thâwina dingin inhlân a ta, pakhat chu pumrawhmang thilinhlânah, mithi leia a suksuolnaa chun inrem- na siempêk a tih; chun, chu ni vêk chun a lu chu a sukthieng ding a nih."
12,"And he shall separate unto Jehovah the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.",Thiemnaw thâwina dingin be- râmte a chal kum khat mi hung chawiin ân suktumna nihai chu LALPA kuomah thaw ṭha nâwk a tih; ân suktumna chu sukpawrche a ni tâk leiin a hmaa mi kha iengkhawm a ni ta si nawh a.
13,"And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting:","Hi hi Nazarit mi, ân suktum ni bîk a kim phaa thaw dân ding chu a nih; intuokna puon in kawtkhâra chun ṭhuoi nîng a ta."
14,"and he shall offer his oblation unto Jehovah, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,","Chun, LALPA ta dinga thilin- hlân dingin berâmchal kum khat mi demkailo pumrawhmang thilinhlâna dingin pakhat, suol inthâwina dingin berâmte, a la, kum khat mi demkailo pakhat,"
15,"and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.","inremna thilinhlân dingin berâmchal demkailo pakhat, chawl ṭhanglo bei le beiphit inditak hrieka hmeta siem beihlawm le hrieka chûl beiphêk inphân bâwm khat, an fâkmi thilinhlân ding le dâwnmi thilin- hlânhai leh an inhlân ding a nih."
16,"And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:","Thiempu chun chuong chu LALPA hmaa chun inhlân a ta, a suol thâwina le pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu inhlân a tih."
17,"and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.",Berâmchal chu bâwma chawl ṭhanglo bei le chun inremna in- thâwina thilinhlân dingin LALPA kuoma chun inhlân a tih. Thiempu chun fâkmi thilinhlân le dâwnmi thilinhlân khawm chu inhlân sa bawk a tih.
18,"And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.","Nazarit mi chun intuokna puon in kawtkhâra chun ân suktumna lu chu vâwng a ta, insuktumna sam chu lâng a ta, inremna inthâwi thilinhlân hnuoia meia chun a raw ding a nih."
19,"And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven the head of his separation;","Chun, thiempu chun berâmchal dâr suong hmin le bâwma chawl ṭhanglo bei pakhat le chawl ṭhanglo beiphêk inphân pakhat lâng a ta. Nazarit mi chun ân suktumna lu chu a vâw zo chun inchawitir a tih; chun, thiempu chun thêna thilinhlân dingin LALPA hmaa chun a thên ding a nih."
20,"and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.","Hi hi thiempu chanpuol in- thieng chu nîng a ta, a thêna thên ir le a mal leh; chu zoa chun Nazarit chun uoin chu dâwn thei tâng a tih."
21,"This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, and of his oblation unto Jehovah for his separation, besides that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his separation.","Hi hi a nih Nazarit thutiem dân le LALPA hmaa an thilinhlân dân chu, ama nuomthua a înhlân tiem loin, ân suktumna thutiem izir peiin a thaw ding a nih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
22,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
23,"Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: ye shall say unto them,","“Aron le a naupasalhai kuomah, ‘Hieng ang hin Israel thlahai chu mal in sâwm ding a nih, an kuomah,"
24,"Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee:","LALPAIN malsâwm cheuin,vêng pei raw se cheu;"
25,"Jehovah make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:","LALPA chun a hmêl in chungah invartir sienla, lunginsiet pei raw se cheu;"
26,"Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.","LALPA chu nangni tieng hung ngha sienla, lungmuongna pe raw se cheu, ti ro,’ tiin hril rawh."
27,So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai chunga chun ka hming chu inchuong- tir nîng a ta, chun, keiin anni chu malsâwm ka tih,” tiin."
