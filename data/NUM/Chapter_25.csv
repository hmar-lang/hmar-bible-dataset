1,And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab:,"Chuongchun, Israelhai chu Sittima an um lai chun, Moab naunuhmeihai an pâwl tah a;"
2,"for they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.","an pathienhai kuoma an in- thâwinahaia chun an fiel tâwl a; Chuongchun, an fâk a, an pathienhai chu chibai an bûk ve tah a."
3,And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.,"Israelhai chun Baal-peor an pawm ve tah a, chuongchun, Israel- hai chunga chun LALPA lung chu a chawk tah a."
4,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.","Chuongchun, Mosie kuomah, “Mipuihai ṭhuoituhai po po chu ṭhuoi la, LALPA lunginsenna ṭiumtak el chu Israelhai chunga inthawka ân kieng theina dingin sûn varah LALPA hmaah khaihlum rawh,” a ta."
5,"And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto Baal-peor.","Chun, Mosie chun Israel rorêl- tuhai kuoma chun, “Baal-peor pawm- tuhai po po chu sukhlum vawng ro,” a ta."
6,"And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.","Chun, ngai ta, Israel laia mi pakhatin intuokna puon in kawt- khâra a ṭap lai takin Mosie mithmua le Israel mi pungkhâwmhai mit- hmuah Midian nuhmei pakhat a unauhai kuomah a hung ṭhuoi a."
7,"And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;","Chun, thiempu Aron naupa Eleazar naupa Phinehas chun a lo hmuh a, pungkhâwmhai laia chun a tho a, fei a lâk a;"
8,"and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.","Chun, Israel mi chu puon in sûnga chun a hnawt lût a. Israel mi leh an pahni chun a sun thleng a, nuhmei chu a phîngah."
9,And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand.,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai chunga hremna chu a re tah a. Chu hremnaa thihai chu sîng hni le sâng li an nih."
10,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
11,"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.","“Thiempu Aron nau Eleazar naupa Phinehas hin ka thîkna anga anni laia a thîkna chun ka lunginsen chu Israel thlahai laia inthawk chun a sukkieng a; chuongchun, ka thîkna chun Israel thlahai chu sukbohmang naw ning."
12,"Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:","Chuleiin, ka remna thuthlung chu a chungah thlung ka ta,"
13,"and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.","ama le a hnunga a thlahai ta dingin kumkhaw thiempu nina thu- thlung nîng a tih; a Pathien ta dingin a thîk a, Israel thlahai ta dinga inremna a siem leiin, ti rawh,” tiin."
14,"Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites.","Israel mi an that, Midian nuhmei le an ithat hming chu Zimri, Simeon mihai laia an pahnam ṭhuoitu Salu naupa a nih."
15,"And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.","Chun, Midian nuhmei an ithat hming chu Kozbi, Zura naunu a nih; ama chu Midian mihai pahnam laia an hotu a nih."
16,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a, “Midian mihai chu suklungzîng unla, sukbohmang ro."
17,"Vex the Midianites, and smite them;","Anni khawma Peor chungchâng thua le Peor chungchâng thu a hrem nia an farnu, Midian mihai milien naunu an that,"
18,"for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.","Kozbi chungchâng thua var vervêka an hlêm chêu ang khan an la hlêm ta rawp si chêu leiin,” tiin."
