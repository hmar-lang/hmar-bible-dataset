1,"And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.","Chun, Israel thla pungkhâwm- hai po po chu thla khatnaa chun Zin thlalêrah an lût a; chun, mipuihai chun Kadesa chun umhmun an khuor a; chutaka chun Miriam chu a thih a, chutaka chun an phûm tah a."
2,And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.,Pungkhâwmhai chun tui an nei ta nawh a. Mosie le Aron chungchâng thuah an inhâwrkhâwm ngiel a.
3,"And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!","Chun, mipui chun, “LALPA hmaa ei unauhai an thi lai khan Pathienin mi lo sukhlum ve thên lem ta sien aw!"
4,"And why have ye brought the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?","Iengdinga LALPA mipui hi thi dinga thlalêra hin ṭhuoi lût am i nih a, keini le kan ranhai le hin?"
5,"And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.","Iengdinga hi ram ṭha nawtaka mi ṭhuoi lût dingin Aigupta rama in- thawka mîn suoktir am i na? Thlai chi dâm, theichanghai, grêphruihai, thei- bufaihai umna ram ni lo hi; tui dâwn ding hrim hrim hlak um lo” tiin Mosie chu an suosal tah a."
6,"And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto them.","Chun, Mosie le Aron chu mipui- hai laia inthawk chu intuokna puon in kawtkhâra chun an va feh a; an bawkkhup a;"
7,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","chun, LALPA ropuina an kuomah a hung inlang a."
8,"Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie chu, “Hmawl la la, pungkhâwmhai chu inumkhâwmtir la, nang le i unau Aron leh, an mithmuah lungpui chu a tui suksuok dingin hril la, lungpuia inthawk chun tui la suokpêk i ta; chuongchun, pungkhâwmhai le an ranhai chu în dâwntir ding annâwm,” tiin a biek a."
9,"And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him.",Mosie chun LALPA hmaa in- thawk chun hmawl chu a thupêk ang chun a lâk a.
10,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?","Mosie le Aron chun pung- khâwmhai chu lungpui bula chun an inumkhâwmtir a, an kuomah, “Mi hel hmanghai, ngai ta u, hi lungpuia inthawk hin tui kan lâk suokpêk ding cheu am a nih?” an ta."
11,"And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.","Mosie chun a bân a phar a, lungpui chu a hmawl chun vawi hni a hang vuok a; chuongchun, tui a hung suok ta zur zur el a, pungkhâwmhai le an ranhai chun an dâwn tah a."
12,"And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie le Aron kuomah, “In mi ring nawh a, Israel thlahai mithmua in mi chawimawi naw leiin, hieng pungkhâwmhai hi ka pêk rama chun ṭhuoi naw ti niu."
13,"These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he was sanctified in them.","Hi hi Meriba tuihai chu a nih; chutaka chun Israel thlahai chu LALPA chungah an chier rak a, ama chun a thienghlimzie a suklang tâk leiin,” a ta."
14,"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:","Mosie chun Kadesa inthawk chun Edom lal kuomah mi a tir a, “I unaupa Israel chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Kan chunga tuorna hung tlung po po hi i hriet a;"
15,"how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers:","kan pi le puhai Aigupta ramah an fe thlah a, sâwttak el Aigupta rama kan um dâm, Aigupta mi- haiin kan pi le puhai le keini ngei khawm ṭha nawtaka an mi thawzie dâm kha."
16,"and when we cried unto Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.","Chuongchun, LALPA kan ko a, kan râwl chu a lo hriet a, vântirko a hung tir a, Aigupta rama inthawkin a mi ṭhuoi suok a; chun, ngai ta, i ram dep tak Kadesa hin kan um a."
17,"Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells; we will go along the king’s highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.","Lunginsiettakin i ram hi fe thleng kan tih; lo amanih, grêp huon amanihah fe naw ning unga a, tuisunsuo tuihai dâwn bawk naw ning ung; lal lamlienah fe pei kan ta, i ram kan khêl hmakhat chun chang- tieng amanih, vawitieng amanih khawm pêt naw ning ungah,’ tiin,” a ta."
18,"And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.","Edom ruok chun a kuomah, “In mi pal thleng ding a ni nawh, in mi pal vai chun a thaw ding chein kâwl- hnâm leh hung inthawk ka tih,” a ta."
19,"And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.","Chuongchun, Israel thlahai chun a kuomah, “Lamlienah hang fêng kan ta, chun, keini le kan ranin i tui kan dâwn chun a man chu pêng kan ti che; thil dang iengkhawm thaw loin a fein fethleng ringawt kan tih,” an ta."
20,"And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.","Ama chun, “Fethleng lo ding,” a ta. Chun, Edom chu mipui tamtak leh mi hrâttakhai leh anni thaw ding chun a hung suok tah a,"
21,Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.,"an fe chu a phal ta nawh a, chuongchun, Israel mihai chun an kîrsan nâwk tah a."
22,"And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.","Chuongchun, Kadesa inthawk chun an suok a, Israel thla mipui po pohai chun Hor tlâng an va tlung a."
23,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie le Aron chu Edom ram dep Hor tlânga chun a biek a, “Aron chu a chipuihai kuoma ṭhuoi nîng a tih;"
24,"Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.",Meriba tuia dâm khan ka thu kalin in hel lei khan Israel thlahai ka pêk rama chun a lût naw ding a nih.
25,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor;",Aron le a naupa Eleazar chu Hor tlângah hung ṭhuoi rawh:
26,"and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.","Aron chu a silfênhai hlîppêk la, a naupa Eleazar chu insiltir rawh: Aron chu a chipuihai kuoma ṭhuoi nîng a ta, chutaka chun thîng a tih,” tiin."
27,And Moses did as Jehovah commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.,"Mosie chun LALPA thupêk ang chun a thaw a, mipui po pohai mit- hmuin Hor tlânga chun an hang fe a."
28,"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Aron chu a silfênhai a hlîppek a, Eleazar ân siltir a, chun, Aron chu tlâng sîpa chun a thi tah a; chun, Mosie le Eleazar chu tlânga inthawk chun an hung thla a."
29,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.","Chun, mipui po poin Aron a thi ti an hriet chun Israel mihai po po chun ni sâwmthum an sûn a."
