1,"And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them;","Chuongchun, Mosie chun biekbûk chu ân ngir zo a, hriek a nâl a, a sukthieng a, a thuomhnaw po po le a mâichâm le a bûrlebêlhai po po hriek a nâl a, a sukthieng ni chun,"
