1,"And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded.","Mosie chun Israel thlahai ṭhuoituhai chu a biek a, “Hi hi a nih LALPAIN thu a pêk chu."
2,"When a man voweth a vow unto Jehovah, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.","Pasalin LALPA kuomah thu a tiem amanih, a lungril thutiema inkhuokhir dinga ân khâm chun a thu chu a bawsiet ding a ni nawh; a bâua suok ta ang po po chun a thaw ding a nih."
3,"Also when a woman voweth a vow unto Jehovah, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father’s house, in her youth,","Nuhmei khawmin a nunghâk laia a pa ina a um laiin LALPA kuom- ah thu a tiem a, a thutiema ân khuokhir a,"
4,"and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.","a thutiem le thutiema a lungril a khuokhir chu a pain a hriet a, a pain a tosan el chun a thutiem po po chu puitling a ta; chun, thutiem tinrêng a lungril a khuokhirnahai chu um zing a tih."
5,"But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and Jehovah will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.","Amiruokchu, a pain a hriet niah a phal naw chun a thutiem- hai, a inkhuokhirna thutiemhai a ieng ieng khawm chu puitling naw nih a, a pain a phal naw a ni leiin LALPAIN ama chu ngaidam a tih."
6,"And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul,","Thutiemin amanih, thu dâwn loa intiemnain amanih a del zing laia pasal a nei a,"
7,"and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.","a pasalin a hriet a, a hriet nia a to zing chun a thutiem chu um zing a ta, a lungril inkhuokhirna thu dâwn loa a thutiem khawm chu um zing a tih."
8,"But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul: and Jehovah will forgive her.","Amiruokchu, a pasal chun a hriet nia a phal naw chun a chunga thu- tiem um le thu dâwn loa ân tiemna chu sukbo a tih; chun, LALPAIN ngaidam a tih."
9,"But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, even everything wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her.","Amiruokchu, hmeithai amanih, mâksiet tâwk amanih hai thutiem chu ân tiemna po po chun del zing a tih."
10,"And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,","Chun, a pasal inah thu a tiem a, inkhâma a lungril khuokhir dinga thu a thlung a, a pasalin a hriet khawma a to zing a,"
11,"and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.","a phalnaw naw chun a thutiem po po chu um zing a ta, ama ân tiemna tinrêng khawm chu um zing a tih."
12,"But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and Jehovah will forgive her.","Amiruokchu, a pasalin a hriet nia iengkhawm ni loa a siem a, a sukbo el chun a thutiem amanih, ama ân tiemna thua a bâu thu suok taphawt chu um ta naw nih a; a pasal chun a sukbo tah a nih; chun, LALPAIN ama chu ngaidam a tih."
13,"Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.",Thutiem po po le hringna sukrinum dinga khuokhirna in- khâmna po po chu a pasalin a sukhmangin a sukbo thei.
14,"But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.","Chuleiin, a pasalin a hriet nia inthawkin a to ṭawk el chun a thutiem tiem ta po po le ân khitna po po chu a suknghet a nih; a hriet nia inthawka a tosan el leiin a suknghet a nih."
15,"But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.","Amiruokchu, a hriet ni ni loa a hnunga iengkhawm ni loa a siem a, a sukbo chun a rîtlona maw chu a phur ding a nih,” tiin."
16,"These are the statutes, which Jehovah commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house.","Hieng hi pasal le nuhmei inkâr le pa le a naunu nunghâk laia a pa ina la um zing, inkâra dân dinga LAL- PAIN Mosie thu a pêkhai chu a nih."
