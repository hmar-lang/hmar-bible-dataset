1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,"Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.","“Aron hril la, a kuomah, ‘Khâwnvarhai chu i sitin khâwnvar pasari chun sathâu khâwnvar siena hmatieng a ên ding a nih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
3,"And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof so as to give light in front of the candlestick, as Jehovah commanded Moses.",Aron chun chuong ang chun a thawh a; LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang chun a thawh a; LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang chun khâwnvar siena hmatienga chun khâwnvarhai chu a sit a.
4,"And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, and unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work: according unto the pattern which Jehovah had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.","Hi khâwnvar siena siem dân chu rangkachak, a suta sut a nih, a ngul bul le a pâr chena sut a nih; LALPAIN Mosie ân entir ang chiein khâwnvar siena chu a siem a."
5,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
6,"Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.","“Levi mihai chu Israel thlahai laia inthawkin suktum la, sukthieng rawh."
7,"And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.","Anni chu sukthieng dingin hieng ang hin i thaw ding a nih; an chungah intlêng faina tui infar la, an taksa po po chu invâwtir la; an puonhai insâwptir la, insukthiengtir rawh."
8,"Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering.","Bâwngchal tuoi pakhat, a fâkmi thilinhlân, hrieka pawl beiphit inditak leh inlâktir la; suol thâwina dingin bâwngchal tuoi dang pakhat i kei bawk ding a nih."
9,And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel:,"Levi mihai chu intuokna puon in bula chun ṭhuoi la, Israel thlahai mipui po po chu inpungkhâwmtir vawng rawh;"
10,and thou shalt present the Levites before Jehovah. And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites:,"chun, Levi mihai chu LALPA kuomah inhlân i ta; Israel thlahai chun Levi mihai chunga chun an kuthai innghat an ta,"
11,"and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Jehovah.","chuongchun, Aron chun Levi mihai chu LALPA rawng an bâwl theina dingin Israel thlahai hmingin a thêna thên thilinhlânah LALPA kuomah inhlân a tih."
12,"And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.","Levi mihai chun bâwngchal luahai chun an kut innghat an ta; chun, Levi mihai ta dinga inremna siemna dingin, pakhat chu suol thâwina dingin, pakhat chu pumraw- hmang thilinhlâna dingin LALPA kuomah în hlân ding a nih."
13,"And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto Jehovah.",Levi mihai chu Aron le a naupasalhai hmaa chun inumtir i ta; LALPA ta dinga a thêna thên thilinhlânah în hlân ding a nih.
14,Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.,"Chuong ang chun Israel thlahai laia inthawkin Levi mihai chu suktum i ta, chuongchun, Levi mihai chu ka ta nîng an tih."
15,"And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.","Chu zoa chun Levi mihai chu intuokna puon ina rawngbâwl dingin lût an ta; nangin anni chu sukthieng i ta, a thêna thên thilinhlânah în hlân ding a nih."
16,"For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.",Israel thlahai laia ka chanpuol dinga ruot an ni sih a; sul hung kêu ta po po Israel thlahai nau lutir po po aiah ka chanpuola ka nei tah a nih.
17,"For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.","Israel thlahai laia nau lutir po po chu ka ta an ni hrim a, mi- hriem ni leh, ran ni leh; Aigupta rama nau lutir po po ka sukhlum lai khan ka chanpuolah ka ruot tah a nih."
18,And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel.,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai lai nau lutir po po aiah Levi mihai hi ka nei tah a nih."
19,"And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.","Chuongchun, Israel thlahai aia intuokna puon ina rawngbâwl ding le, Israel thlahaiin hmun inthieng an hung hnai khawma Israel thlahai laia hri ân lêng nawna dinga inremna siem dingin Israel thlahai laia inthawkin Levi mihai hi Aron le a naupasalhai ka pêk a nih,” tiin."
20,"Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto all that Jehovah commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.","Chuong ang chun Mosie hai, Aron hai, Israel thlahai pung- khâwmhai po po chun Levi mihai chunga chun an thawh a; Levi mihai chungchâng thua LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang po po chun an chungah Israel thlahai chun an thawh a."
21,"And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.","Chuongchun, Levi mihai chu suola inthawk chun an insukthieng a, an puonhai an sâwp a; chun, Aron chun LALPA hmaa a thêna thên thilinhlân dingin ân hlân a; chun, anni chu sukthiengna ding Aronin inremna a siempêk a."
22,"And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.","Chun, chu zoa chun Levi mihai chu Aron le a naupasalhai hnuoia an rawngbâwl sin thaw ding chun intuokna puon in sûnga chun an lût a; Levi mihai chungchâng thua LALPA- IN Mosie thu a pêk angin an chunga chun an thaw tah a."
23,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
24,This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting:,"“Levi mihai chanpuol chu hieng hi a nih, kum sâwmhni panga chen chungtieng chun intuokna puon ina rawngbâwlna sin thâwng an ta;"
25,"and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,","kum sâwmnga mihai chun chu rawngbâwl sin chu châwlsan an ta, rawngbâwl ta naw ni hai."
26,"but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.","Amiruokchu, intuokna puon in enkawl thua chun an unauhai ṭhang- pui pei an ta, rawng ruok chu bâwl ta naw ni hai. Hieng ang hin Levi mihai chu an sin ding i rêlpêk ding a nih,” tiin."
