2,"And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.","Chun, Israel mihai chun LALPA kuomah thu an tiem a, “Hieng mi- hai hi kan kuta i mi pêk chun an khuohai hi sukbohmang dêr kan tih,” an ta."
3,"And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Israel mihai thu chu a pawm a, Kanaan mihai chu a pêk a, anni le an khuohai chu an sukbohmang tah a; a hmun hminga chun Horma an inbûk a."
4,"And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.","Chun, Hor tlânga inthawk chun Tuisuoriet Sen tieng Edom ram fe huolin an feh a: a lampui lei chun mipuihai lung chu a hnuol hle a."
5,"And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.","Mipuihai thi el dingin iengdinga Aiguptaa inthawka i mi ṭhuoi suok am a na? Bei um lo, tui hlak um bawk lo; hi bei tirdakum khawm hi kan hringna hin a hnâm tah a nih, an ta."
6,"And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN mipui- hai lai chun rûl a mi chuk na chihai a tir a, mihai chu an chuk a, Israel mi tamtak chu an thih a."
7,"And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee; pray unto Jehovah, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.","Chun, mihai chu Mosie kuomah an feh a, “LALPA le nangma kala kan lo ṭawng ta hi kan lo suol tah a nih; keini laia rûlhai hi sukbo dingin LALPA kuomah ṭawngṭai raw khai,” an tih a; chuongchun, mihai chu Mosie chun a ṭawngṭaipêk a."
8,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuomah, “Rûl mi chuk na chi kha a lim siem la, banah khai rawh; rûl chuk taphawt- in chu chu an en chun dam an tih,” a ta."
9,"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.","Chuongchun, Mosien dâr rûl a siem a, banah a khai a, rûl chuk taphawtin dâr rûl chu an enin an dam pei a."
10,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.","Chun, Israel thlahai chu an fe pei tah a; Obothah umhmun an khuor a."
11,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.",Obotha inthawk chun an fe nâwk a; nisa suokna tieng pangah Moab thlalêr bul Ije–abarimah um- hmun an khuor a.

13,"From thence they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.","Chutaka inthawk chun an fe nâwk a. Amor mihai ramria inthawka hung filawr thlalêra Arnon khing- tieng pangah umhmun an khuor a; Arnon chu Moab ramri, Moab le Amor mihai inkâra um a nih."
14,"Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,","Chuleiin, LALPA Indonahai bua chun– “Suphah-a Vaheb, Arnon ruomhai,"
15,"And the slope of the valleys That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of Moab.","Ar umna tienga thle, Moab rama innghat Ruom pangpêrhai chu,” tiha hril a nih."
16,"And from thence they journeyed to Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.","Chutaka inthawk chun Beerah an fe nâwk a, chu chu LALPAIN Mosie kuoma, “Mipuihai ko khâwm la, tui pêng ka tih,” a tina tuisunsuo chu a nih."
17,"Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:","Chun, hi hla hi Israelhai chun an sak a, “Aw tuikhur, hung inchik suok rawh, Zaiin awi ro, Lalhaiin an cho tuikhur chu."
18,"The well, which the princes digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre, and with their staves. And from the wilderness they journeyed to Mattanah;","An lal hmawl le an hembâwka, Mipuihai mi lienhai icho chu.” Chun, thlalêra inthawk chun Matta- naah an feh a."
19,and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;,"Mattanaa inthawk chun Naha- lielah an feh a; Nahaliela inthawk chun Bamothah,"
20,"and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert.",Bamotha inthawk chun Moab loa ruom le thlalêr Jeshimon zuk suk en Pisga sîpah.
21,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,","Chun, Israel mihai chun Amor mihai lal Sihon kuomah mi an tir a,"
22,"Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed thy border.","“I rama hin mîn fe thlengtir raw khai; loa manih, grêp huona manih, pêt naw ning ung a, tuisunsuo tuihai khawm dâwn naw ning ung a, i ram kan khêl hmakhat chun lal lamlienah fe pei kan tih,” tiin."
23,"And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, Sihon chun Israel mihai chu a ram fe thleng chu a phal nawh a; Sihon chun a mihai po po chu a khâwm vawng a. Israel mihai chu thaw dingin thlalêra chun an vân thawk suok ta lem a, Jahaz an va tlung a; chuongchun, Israel mihai chu an va thaw tah a."
24,"And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.","Chun, Israel mihai chun kâwl- hnâm leh an lo thawh a, a ram chu Arnona inthawka Jabbok chenin, Ammon thlahai ramri Jazer chenin an neipêk a; Ammon thlahai ram chu a khir hle a nih."
25,"And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof.","Israel mihai chun chuong khuo po po chu an lâk a, chuongchun, Israel mihai chu Amor mihai khuohai po poa chun an um a, Hesbon le a khawper po poa dâm chun."
26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.","Hesbon chu Amor mihai lal Sihon khuo a na, ama chu chu hmaa Moab lalhai thawh a, a kuta in- thawka ram po po Arnon chena lâkpêktu a nih."
27,"Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:","Chuleiin, hla phuoktuhai chun, “Hesbonah hung unla, Sihon khawpui chu inngir le sukdet ni sienla,"
28,"For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.","Hesbona inthawkin mei a suok a, Sihon khawpuia inthawk chun meichawk, Moaba Ar a kâng zo a."
29,"Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.","Arnon hmun insâng lalhai chu, I chung a rik de, Moab! I bohmang a ni tah, aw Kemos chibai bûktuhai, A naupasalhai chu tlânse ding le, A naunuhmeihai chu salah um dingin a pêk a, Amor mihai lal Sihon kuomah."
30,"We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which reacheth unto Medeba.","Kan hang kâp a, Hesbon a bohmang a, Dibon chenin. Nopha chenin ka sukrêm a, Medeba tlung rakin,” an tih."
31,Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.,Chuong ang chun a nih Amor mihai rama Israelhai chu an um chu.
32,"And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.","Chun, Mosie chun Jazer va enthla dingin mi a tir a, chutaka khuohai chu an lâk a. Amor mi umhai chu an hnawt suok a."
33,"And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.","Chun, an kîr nâwk a, Basan lampui tieng an feh a, chun Basan lal Og, ama le mi po pohai chu, anni doa Edreia lo thaw dingin an hung inthawk a."
34,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Ama chu ṭi naw, ama khawm, a mi po pohai khawm, a ram khawm i kutah ka pêk ta a nih; Hesbona um Amor mihai lal Sihon chunga i thaw angin i thaw ding a nih,” a ta."
35,"So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.","Chuongchun, ama khawm, a naupasalhai khawm, hla hrim hrim nei loin a mihai leh an that a; a ram chu an hluopêk tah a."
