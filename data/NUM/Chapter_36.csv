1,"And the heads of the fathers’ houses of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ houses of the children of Israel:","Chun, Josef sûnghai laia mi Manasse naupa Makir naupa Gilead thlahai pahnam ṭhuoituhai laia mihai chun an hung hnai a, Mosie le hotu Israel thlahai ṭhuoi- tuhai hmaa chun thu an hril a,"
2,"and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.","“LALPA chun kan pu chu Israel thlahai chu aisâna an hluo ding ram pe dingin thu a pêk a; chun, LALPAIN kan pu chu kan naupa Zelophehad hluo ding chu a naunu- hmeihai pe dingin thu a pêk a;"
3,"And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.","chun, anni chun Israel thlahai laia mi hnam dang tu nauhai khawm pasala an nei chun, kan pi le puhai ram an hluo chu lâkpêk a, an va ṭhangnahai rama bel ding nîng a ta, chuong ang chun kan ram chanpuola inthawk ṭhe suok hung nîng a ta."
4,"And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.","Chun, Israel thlahai Jubili a hung tlung pha chun an ram chu an va ṭhangna ding taphawthai hnam rama bel nîng a tih; chuongchun, kan pi le puhai hnam rama inthawkin an ram chu lâk hêkin a hung um ding a nih,” an ta."
5,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right.","Chun, Mosie chun LALPA thu angin Israel thlahai chu thu a pêk a, “Josef naupasalhai hnam hin an hril dik a nih."
6,"This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.","Zelophehad naunuhmeihai chung- châng thua LALPAIN thu a pêk chu hieng ang hin a nih: ‘ṭha an ti taphawt nei hai sienla, amiruokchu, an pahai hnam chanpui laia mi ngei an ni ding a nih,’ tiin."
7,So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai hnam chu hnam dang dang kuomah sawn sawn ni naw nih. Israel thlahai chun an pi le puhai hnam ram chu an chang zing ding a nih."
8,"And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.","Chun, Israel thlahai laia ro- hluotu ding naunuhmei taphawt chu Israel thlahaiin an pi le puhai ram an hluo seng theina dingin an pahnam chanpui laia mi ngei nuhmei a ni ding a nih."
9,So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance.,"Chuongchun, ram chu hnam dang dang kuoma sawn sawn a ni naw ding a nih. Israel thlahai chun anni ram seng chu an chang ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
10,"Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie chu thu a pêk ang charin Zelophehad naunu- hmeihai chun an thaw a."
11,"for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’ sons.","Zelophehad naunuhmei Mahla hai, Tirza hai, Hogla hai,"
12,They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.,"Milka hai, Noa hai chun an pa unaupa naupasalhai an nei tâwl a, Josef naupa Manasse naupasalhai an nei a, an ram chu an pahnama chun a um zing tah a."
13,These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.,"Hieng hi LALPAIN Mosie hmanga Jeriko zâwn Jordan râl Moab phaia Israel thlahai a pêk, thupêkhai le rorêl dânhai chu a nih."
