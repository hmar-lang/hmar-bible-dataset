1,"Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:","Levi naupa Kohath, chu naupa Izhar, chu naupa Kora chun Eliab naupasalhai Dathan le Abiram le Peleth naupa On, Reuben thlahai leh mihai an ṭhuoi a."
2,"and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;","Israel thlahai, mi inlâr deu deu mipui laia hotu, rorêltu thlanghai laia mi za hni le sâwmngahai leh Mosie hmaah an va feh a."
3,"and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of Jehovah?","Mosie le Aron chu sawisêlin an pungkhâwm a, an kuomah, “In insukngêng êm el, mipuihai chu an inthieng seng sih a; LALPA khawm anni lai a um sih a; iengdinga LALPA mipui pungkhâwmhai chunga hin in insie chunghnung bîk am a na?” an ta."
4,"And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:",Chu chu Mosien a hang hriet chun a bawkkhup a.
5,"and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.","Kora le a pâwlhai po po kuoma chun, “Zingah zîngkâr LALPAIN a tahai le ân thienghai chu suklangin ama va hnai dingin hung tîng a ta, a thlanghai ngei chu ama va hnai dingin tîng a tih."
6,"This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his company;","Hieng ang hin thaw ro, Kora le a pâwl po po hai;"
7,"and put fire in them, and put incense upon them before Jehovah to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.","zingah meilâkna dâm chawi unla, chutaka chun mei sie unla, LALPA hmaah riminhnik phul ro; chun, LALPAIN a thlang taphawt chu inthieng el a tih. Levi nauhai, in insukngêng êm el,” tiin a hril a."
8,"And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi:","Chun, Mosien Kora kuomah, “Nangni Levi nauhai, ngai ta u,"
9,"seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them;","LALPA biekbûka rawngbâwla, mipuihai hmaa an rawngbâwla ngîr dinga Israelhai Pathienin ama hnai dinga Israel mipuihai laia inthawka a suktum cheu a,"
10,"and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also?",Levi naupasal in unauhai po po le ama hnai dinga ân umtir cheu hi thil chînah in ngai a ni maw? Thiempu nina khawm in la zawng sa rawp a ni maw?
11,"Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?","Chuleiin, nang le i pâwlhai po po chu LALPA chu kalin in pung- khâwm a nih. Aron khawm hin ieng am a thawa a chunga hi chier in ni leh?” a ta."
12,"And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:","Chun, Mosie chun Eliab nâupa Dathan le Abiram ân kotir a, anni chun, “Hung naw ning ungah!"
13,"is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?",Thlalêra mi sukhlum dingin nênetui le khuoizu luongna rama inthawkin i mi ṭhuoi suok hi thil chîn am a ni hrim luoh a? Kan chungah lalin în sie nâwk nghâl a.
14,"Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.","Nênetui luongna ramah i mi ṭhuoi lût nawh a, lo le grêp huon ro ding i mi pêk bawk nawh; mi hlêm i tum a, hung naw ning ungah,” an ta."
15,"And Moses was very wroth, and said unto Jehovah, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.","Chuongchun, Mosie chu a lung a sen hle el tah a; LALPA kuomah, “An thilinhlân chu pawm naw rawh, an sabengtung chu pakhat khawm ka lâk nawh a, tukhawm ka sukna bawk nawh,” a ta."
16,"And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:","Chun, Mosie chun Kora kuom- a chun, “Zîngah nang le i mi pungkhâwmhai nang leh, anni leh, Aron leh LALPA hmaah hung um ro, an mei lâkna chawi seng hai sienla,"
17,"and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.","riminhnik phul hai sienla, LALPA hmaa mei lâkna seng, mei- lâkna za hni le sâwmnga chu hung chawi raw hai se; nang le Aron khawmin in mei lâkna chawi ve ve ro,” a ta."
18,"And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.","Chuongchun, mi tin chun an mei lâkna chu an chawi a, mei an sieh a, riminhnik an phul a; Mosie le Aron leh intuokna puon in kawtkhâra chun an va ngîr a."
19,And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the congregation.,"Chun, Kora chun mipui po po chu anni kalin intuokna puon in kawtkhâra chun ân umkhâwmtir a; chun, mipuihai po po chunga chun LALPA ropuina a hung inlang a."
20,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie le Aron a biek a,"
21,"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.","“Hieng mipuihai laia inthawk hin insiekieng ro; ka hung sukbo- hmang thut theina dingin,” tiin."
22,"And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?","Chuongchun, anni chu an bawk- khup a, “Aw Pathien, tisa po pohai thlarau Pathien, mi pakhat suol leiin mipui po po chungah i lunginsen ding am a nih?” an tih a."
23,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie a biek a,"
24,"Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.","“Mipuihai kuoma chun, ‘Kora hai, Dathan hai, Abiram hai bûka inthawk hin inkiengsan vawng ro,’ tiin hril rawh,” a ta."
25,And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.,"Chuongchun, Mosie chu a tho a, Dathan le Abiram kuoma chun a va feh a; Israel upahai chun an zui a."
26,"And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.","Chun, pungkhâwmhai kuoma chun, “Hieng mi suolhai puon ina inthawk dâm hin suok ro khai; an iengkhawm hi tâwk naw ro, chuong naw chun chu an suolna po poa hin ṭhang ve rawi in tih,” tiin a hril a."
27,"So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.","Chuongchun, Kora hai, Dathan hai, Abiram hai bûka inthawkhai chun an suok ta dur dur el a; chun, Dathan le Abiram chu an puon ina inthawk chun an hung suok a, an puonin kawtkhâra chun an nuhmei- hai, an naupasalhai, an naunuhmei- hai le chun an ngir a."
28,"And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.","Chun, Mosien, “Keia lungril puoksuoka thaw a ni nawh a, hieng thil thaw ding hin LALPAIN a mi tir a nih ti hienga hin hrieng in tih."
29,"If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then Jehovah hath not sent me.","Hieng mihai po po hi mi dang thi dân ang bawkin an thi a, mi po po hrem ang bawka hrem an ni chun Pathienin a mi tir naw nîng a ta."
30,"But if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand that these men have despised Jehovah.","LALPAIN thil thar a siem a, hnuoiin a bâu a ka a, anni le an ta po po a lem a, Seolah a hringa an lût ruok chun hieng mihai hin LALPA an lo ngainêp a nih ti hrieng in tih,” a ta."
31,"And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them;","Chuong thu po po chu a hril zo chun, an hnuoi leihnuoi chu a hung kak ta phut el a,"
32,"and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.","chuongchun, leihnuoi chun a bâu chu a kah a, an sûngkuoin, Kora mihai po po, an thuomhnaw po po leh a lem zo vawng tâwl tah a."
33,"So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.","Chuongchun, anni le an ta po po chu a hringin Seola chun an tlum ta vawng a, leihnuoi chun a bâu ân chîp nel a, pungkhâwm laia inthawk chu an bohmang tah a."
34,"And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.","Chuongchun, an vêla Israel mi po pohai chu an khêk ria chun an tlân dar a, “Hnuoiin mi lem ve hlau rawi a tih,” an tih a."
35,"And fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.","Chun, LALPA kuoma inthawkin mei a hung suok a, riminhnik inhlântu mi za hni le sâwmnga hai chu a hung kâng hlum tah a."
36,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie a biek a,"
37,"Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy,","“Thiempu Aron naupa Eleazar chu meia inthawka mei lâknahai chu la suok dingin hril la, sukdar neng raw se, thil inthieng a ni sih a,"
38,even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.,"mei lâknahai chu hieng thilsuol thawtuhaiin thi pha hiela an inhlân a ni sih a. Chuleiin, mâichâm inkhum- na phêk dinga sut ni raw se. LALPA hmaa inhlân an na, chuleiin, an inthieng a nih; chu chu Israel thlahai ta dinga inchikna nîng a tih,” tiin."
39,"And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,","Chuongchun, thiempu Eleazar chun a kânghai dârsen mei lâknahai chu a lâk a, mâichâm inkhumnahai sut a ni tah a;"
40,"to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before Jehovah; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as Jehovah spake unto him by Moses.","Mosie hmanga a kuoma LAL- PAIN a lo hril ta ang chun, Aron thla ni lo hnam dang hrim hrim LALPA hmaa riminhnik raw dinga an fe hnai nawna ding le, Kora le a pâwlhai anga an hung um nawna dingin."
41,"But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.","Nisienlakhawm, a zînga chun, “LALPA mihai in sukhlum a nih,” tiin Israel thla pungkhâwm po po chu Mosie le Aron chunga chun an chier a."
42,"And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.","Chun, Mosie le Aron chunga mi- pui an pungkhâwm lai chun intuokna puon in tieng an nghah a; sûmin a hung inkhum le LALPA ropuina hung inlang chu an hmuh a."
43,And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.,"Chun, Mosie le Aron chu intuok- na puon in tuola chun an va feh a."
44,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie a biek a,"
45,"Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.","“Hieng mipuihaia inthawk hin insiekieng ro, ka hung sukbohmang thut theina dingin,” tiin. Chun, anni chu an bawkkhup a."
46,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take thy censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun.","Mosie chun Aron kuomah, “I mei lâkna chawi la, mâichâma inthawkin mei sie la, riminhnik phul la, mipui- hai lai chun fepui vat la, an ta dingin inremna siem rawh. LALPA kuoma inthawkin lunginsenna a hung suok a nih, hri ân lêng ṭan mêk a nih,” a ta."
47,"And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.","Aron chun Mosie hril ang chun a chawi a, pungkhâwmhai laia chun a tlân lût tah a, hri chu mipui lai ân lêng ṭan tah ti a hmuh a, riminhnik chu a phul a, mipui ta ding chun inremna chu a siem a."
48,And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.,"Mithi le mi hring inkâra chun a ngîr a, hri chu ân kieng tah a."
49,"Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.","Chuongchun, Kora chungchâng thua thihai tiem loin hria thi po po chu sîng khat sâng li le za sari an nih."
50,And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.,"Chun, Aron chu intuokna puon in kawtkhâra Mosie kuoma chun a kîr nâwk a, chuongchun, hri chu ân kieng tah a."
