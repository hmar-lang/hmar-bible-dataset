1,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.","Chun, Israel thlahai chu an fe pei a, Jeriko zâwn Jordan râl Moab phaihaia chun umhmun an khuor a."
2,And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.,"Chun, Zippor naupa Balak chun Israel mihaiin Amor mihai an thaw dân po po chu a hriet a."
3,"And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.","Chun, Moab mihai chun mihai chu an ṭi hle el a, an tam hle sih a; Israel thlahai lei chun Moab mihai chu an lunginzîng tah a."
4,"And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.","Chuongchun, Moab mihai chun Midian mi upahai kuomah, “Hieng mipuihai hin bâwngin hlohna an pet zo angin ei vêla mi po po an pet zo ding annâwm,” an ta. Chuong lai chun Zippor naupa Balak chu Moab lal a nih."
5,"And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.","Ama chun Amaw rama Euphrates vadung panga Pethora Beor naupa Balaam kuomah mi a tir a, “Ngai ta, hnam pakhat Aiguptaa inthawka hung suok an um a, leihnuoi a dâpin an hung dâp a, keia mi dep tâwtah an um a;"
6,"Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.","lunginsiettakin hung la, hieng mihai hi ṭawngsie mi vân phur pêk ta khai; keia ta ding chun an hrât taluo a nih, kan that theiin, kan hne theiin, kan rama inthawk hi kan hnawt suok thei khiet rawi mawh; mal i sâwm taphawthai chu malsâwmin an um a; ṭawngsie în phur taphawthai chu ṭawngsephurin an um ti ka hriet sih a,” tiin a vân ko tir a."
7,"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.","Chuongchun, Moab upahai le Midian upahai chu aisân man ding chawiin an suok tah a; Balaam kuom chu an va tlung a, Balak thu incha chu an hril a."
8,"And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Jehovah shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Vawizân chu hitaka hin riek unla, LALPAIN a mi hril ang angin in kuomah thu hung intlun ka tih,” a ta: chuongchun, Moab mi lienhai chu Balaam kuoma chun an riek tah a."
9,"And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?","Balaam kuoma chun Pathien a hung a, “I kuoma mihai hi tuhai am an na?” a ta."
10,"And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,","Balaam chun Pathien kuomah, “Zippor naupa Moab lal Balak chun ka kuomah mi a hung tir a,"
11,"Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.","‘Ngai ta, Aigupta rama in- thawka hung hnam chun leihnuoi an hung dâp a; hung la ṭawngsie mi vân phurpêk rawh, ka do theiin ka hnawt suok thei khiet rawi mawh,’ tiin,” a ta."
12,"And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.","Pathien chun Balaam kuomah, “An kuoma chun i fe ding a ni nawh. Chuong mihai chu ṭawngsie în phur ding a ni nawh, mi hamṭha an nih,” a ta."
13,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go with you.","Chuongchun, Balaam chu zîngkâr a tho a, Balak mi lienhai kuoma chun, “In rama chun fe nâwk ta ro khai, LALPAIN in kuoma fe dinga suok a phal naw a nih,” a ta."
14,"And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.","Chuongchun, Moab mi lienhai chu an tho a, Balak kuoma chun an feh a, “Balaam chun keini a mi hung zui nuom nawh,” an ta."
15,"And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.","Balak chun mi lien tam nâwk zuol, anni nêka ropui lem a tir nâwk a."
16,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:","Balaam kuom chu an va tlung a, a kuomah, “Zippor naupa Balak chun hieng hin a ti a nih, ‘Ka kuoma i hung hi iengkhawmin hluo naw raw se."
17,"for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.","Mi ropuitakah siem ka ti cheh a, ka kuoma i hril taphawt chu thaw pei ka tih; chuleiin, hung hrâm la, hieng mihai hi ṭawngsie mi vân phurpêk hrâm ta khai,’ a tih a,” an ta."
18,"And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.","Balaam ruok chun Balak mihai chu a dawn a, an kuomah, “Balak chun a in tangka le rângkachak sip hi mi pe ding ni sienkhawm, ieng ieng- khawm LALPA ka Pathien thu bawsein ka thaw thei nawh."
19,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak unto me more.","Chuleiin, LALPAIN ka kuomah iengtin am a hril nâwk ding hrim, vawizân khawm hitaka hin riek nâwk phawt ta u khai,” a ta."
20,"And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.","Chun, zâna chun Pathien chu Balaam kuoma chun a hung a, a kuomah, “Hieng mihai hi nanga koa hung an ni chun tho la, anni zui rawh, amiruokchu, i kuoma ka hril chau che hi i thaw ding a nih,” a ta."
21,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.","Chuongchun, Balaam chu zîng- kâr a tho a, sabengtung a siemrêl a, Moab mi lienhai chu a zui tah a."
22,"And God’s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.","Chun, a fe lei chun Pathien lung chu a hung chawk tah a, chun, LAL- PA vântirko chu a lo dang dingin lampuia chun a lo ngîr a. A sabeng- tung chunga chuong a na, a sie- hlawhai pahni a kuomah an um veh a."
23,"And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.","Sabengtung chun LALPA vân- tirko, kâwlhnâm chawia lampuia ngîr chu a hmuh a, chuongchun, sabeng- tung chu lampuia inthawk chu a pêt a, ramhnuoia chun a fe tah a. Balaam chun sabengtung chu lampuia infe kîrtir tum chun a vuok a."
24,"Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.","Chun, LALPA vântirko chu grêp huon pal le pal inkâr lam inchêpnaah a ngîr a."
25,"And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.","Chun, sabengtung chun LALPA vântirko chu a hmuh a, pal chu a va hneng a, Balaam ke chu pala chun a hneng deh a; chuongchun, Balaam chun a vuok nâwk a."
26,"And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.","Chun, LALPA vântirko chu a khêl hreta chun a feh a, hmun in chêp tak, changtieng amanih vawitieng amanih pêtna um nawna lai taka chun a ngîr tah a."
27,"And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.","Chun, sabengtung chun LALPA vântirko chu a hmuh a, Balaam chu a bawkpui tah a; chuongchun, Balaam a lung chu a hung sen tah a, a hmawlin sabengtung chu a vuok a."
28,"And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?","Chuongchun, LALPAIN sabeng- tung chu ân ṭawngtir a. Balaam kuoma chun, “Ieng am ka law che a, hienga vawi thum zet mi vaw am i na?” a ta."
29,"And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.","Balaam chun sabengtung kuoma chun, “I mi suknawmna leiin a nih; kâwlhnâm lem chu chawi lang chu sukhlum hiel tâng ka ti che,” a ta."
30,"And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay.","Sabengtung chun Balaam kuoma chun, “Tu chena i chuong rawpna i sabengtung ka ni an naw am a nih? Hieng ang hin ka thaw hlak luo che am a nih?” a ta. Ama chun, “Thaw ngai lo e,” a ta."
31,"Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.","Chun, LALPAIN Balaam mit chu a sukvarpêk a, chuongchun, LALPA vântirko kâwlhnâm chawia lampuia ngîr chu a hmu tah a, a kûn a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin a bawkkhup a."
32,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me:","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun a kuomah, “Iengdinga hienga vawi thum rau i sabengtung i vuok am? Ngai ta, i thaw dân chu ka mithmua hin sietna a ni leiin lo dang ding chein ka hung suok a nih;"
33,"and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.","chun, sabengtung chun a mi hmuh a, ka hmaa chun vawi thum a pêt a ni kha, pêt naw sienla chu ama chu sukhlum si loin, nang sukhlum hiel naw ning che,” a ta."
34,"And Balaam said unto the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.","Balaam chun LALPA vântirko kuomah, “Ka lo suol a ni ta chu, mi dang dingin lampuiah i ngîr ti ka hriet si nawh a; chuleiin, i lâwm naw chun kîr nâwk el ka tih,” a ta."
35,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun Balaam kuomah chun, “Hieng mihai hi zui pei la, amiruokchu, i kuomah ka thu hril ding che chau hi i hril ding a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Balaam chun Balak mi lienhai chu a zui ta pei a."
36,"And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.",Balakin Balaam a hung ti a hriet chun Arnon tienga an ramri chenin a va tuok a.
37,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?","Balak chun Balaam kuomah, “Ṭhahnemngaitakin ko ding chein mi ka hung tir a ni naw am a nih? Ieng dinga ka kuomah hung nuom lo am i na? Mi ropui takah ka siem thei che a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
38,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.","Balaam chun Balak kuomah, “Ngai ta, hi ka hung tah a, nuom nuom hril theina ka nei am a nih? Pathienin ka bâua thu a sie chau ka hril ding a nih,” a ta."
39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.","Chuongchun, Balaam chu Balak kuoma chun a fe tah a; Kiriath-buzoth an va tlung tah a."
40,"And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.","Chun, Balak chu bâwng le be- râmin ân thâwi a, a sa chu Balaam le a kuoma mi lien umhai chu a thawn a."
41,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.","Chun, a zinga chun Balak chun Balaam chu a ṭhuoi a; Baal hmun insâng haia chun a hang fe pui a, chutaka inthawk chun, Israel mipui po po a hmu phâk a."
