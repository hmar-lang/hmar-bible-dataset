1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,","Chun, Jeriko zâwn Jordan va- pang, Moab phaia chun LALPAIN Mosie a biek a,"
2,"Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites.","“Israel thlahai chu thu pe la, an ramahai chun Levi mihai umna ding khuohai siempêk raw hai se; chun, ran tlatna dingin khaw kâwl vêl- hai chu Levi mihai chu i pêk ding a nih."
3,"And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.","Khuohai chu an umna ding nîng a ta, a vêlhai chu an bâwng le an ran, an thil vai po pohai ta dingin nîng a tih."
4,"And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.",Khaw kâwl Levi mihai i pêk ding chu khaw kula inthawka tawng sâng khata hla a ni ding a nih.
5,"And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.","Kul puotienga inthawkin in- khîng i ta, saktieng pangah tawng sâng hni, simtieng pangah tawng sâng hni; thlangtieng pangah tawng sâng hni, hmârtieng pangah tawng sâng hni, khuo a lai taka umin. Hi hi an khuo khawhnâwm nîng a tih."
6,"And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities.","Chun, Levi mihai i pêk ding khuohai chu tuolthathai tlânna dingin himna khuo paruk nîng a ta; chuong naw khawm chu khuo sâwmli pahni i pêk bawk ding a nih."
7,All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities; them shall ye give with their suburbs.,"Levi mihai i pêk ding khuo po pohai chu khuo sâwmli pariet nîng a tih, an khawhnâwm seng pei leh."
8,"And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites.","Israel thlahai ihluo khuo i pêk dân chu a tam deua inthawk chun pe tam deu i ta; a tlâwm deua inthawk chun pe tlâwm i ta, pahnam tinin an hluo ram tam dân i zirin a khuo chu Levi mihai a pêk ding a nih,” tiin."
9,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a, “Israel thlahai hril la, an kuomah,"
10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,","‘Jordan vadung in kai a, Kanaan ram in lût pha chun,"
11,"then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.","himna khuo ding in ruot ding a nih, tuolthat paltu tlânna dingin."
12,"And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment.",Chuong khuohai chu phuba- latua inthawka himna khuohai nîng an ta; pungkhâwmhai hmaa rorêlpêk dinga a ngir hmaa tuolthattu chu a thi nawna dingin.
13,And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.,"Chuongchun, in ta dinga himna khuo in ruothai chu khuo paruk nîng a ta."
14,"Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.","Jordan râlah khaw thum ruot in ta, Kanaan ramah khaw thum ruot in ta; himna khuohai nîng an tih."
15,"For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.","Israel thlahai le hnam dang le an kuoma chênghai ta dingin hi khuo paruk hi himna khuohai nîng an tih, chutaka chun tukhawm mi that palhai chu an tlân ding a nih."
16,"But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.","Amiruokchu, thîr hriemhrei hmanga mi a thawh a, a thi chun, tuolthat a nih, tuolthattu chu suk- hlum ngei ding a nih."
17,"And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.","Chun, thina khawpa lunga mi a suk a, a thi chun tuolthat a nih, tuolthattu chu sukhlum ngei ding a nih."
18,"Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.","Chun, thi khawpa thinga mi a vuok a, a thi chun tuolthat a nih, tuolthattu chu sukhlum ngei ding a nih."
19,"The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.",Thisen phubalatu chun tuol- thattu chu that nghâl el a tih. A hmu pha pha a sukhlum el ding a nih.
20,"And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,","Chun, mi a theida leia nam rak amanih, inchân rûka dênga a thiin amanih,"
21,"or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him.","intaina leia a chum hlum amani chun a sukhlumtu chu sukhlum ve ngei nîng a tih; tuolthat a nih, thisen phubalatu chun a hmu pha pha a sukhlum el ding a nih."
22,"But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,","Amiruokchu, intai lei khawm ni chuong loa, nam thut amanih, chun, inchân ni kher loa dêng amanih,"
23,"or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;","an um ti khawm hre loa, a hmêlma khawm ni loa, a pawitâwk khawm ni chuong loa, lungin ama- nih a dêng a, mi a lo thi dâm a ni chun,"
24,then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;,pungkhâwmhaiin hieng rorêlna dân ang hin a sukhlumtu thisen phubalatu ro chu a rêlpêk ding a nih;
25,"and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.","pungkhâwmhai chun tuolthattu chu thisen phubalatua inthawk chun hum an ta, pungkhâwmhai chun a tlânna, himna khuoa chun inumtir nâwk an ta, hriek inthienga nâl, thiempu lal a thi hmakhat chun chutaka chun a um ding a nih."
26,"But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,","Amiruokchu, ienglai khawmin tuolthattu chu a tlânna, himna khaw ramri puotieng a feh a,"
27,"and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,","thisen phubalatuin a himna khaw puoa a hmuh a, thisen phu- balatuin a that chun thisena chun thiemnaw chang naw ni;"
28,because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.,thiempu lal a thi hmakhat chun chu himna khuoa chun a um zing ding a ni leiin; thiempu a thi hnunga ruok chun tuolthattu chu a umna rama chun a kîr nâwk ding a nih.
29,And these things shall be for a statute and ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.,Hieng thil hi in thlahai chena in umna taphawta in rorêl dân ding chu nîng a tih.
30,"Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.","Tukhawma mi a that chun tuol- thattu chu hretuhai bâua inthawka thu suokin sukhlum ding a nih; ami- ruokchu, hretu pakhat chau chu, chu chu sukhlumna ding chun a hun nawh."
31,"Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.","Chun, tuolthattu chu in intlan ding a ni nawh, thina khawpa thiem- naw chang a na, sukhlum ngei ding a ni lem."
32,"And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.","Chun, thiempu thi hma chun a himna khuoa tlân, a rama um nâwk ding intlanna chu in lâk ding a ni nawh."
33,"So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.","Chuongchun, in umna ram chu, sukpawrche ding a ni nawh, thisen chun ram chu in sukpawrche sih a, thisen suokna ram pawrche sâwpna ding chun thisen insuotu thisen ngawt naw chu hmang thei a ni si nawh a."
34,"And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.","In umna ram, ka umna hi in sukpawrche ding a ni nawh, kei LALPA chu Israel thlahai lai hin ka um sih a,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
