1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.,"“Midian mihai chungah Israel thlahai phuba la rawh; chu zoa chun i chihai kuomah ṭhuoi ni tâng i tih,” tiin."
3,"And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah’s vengeance on Midian.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun mipui- hai chu a biek a, “Midian mihai chunga LALPA phubalâkna thaw dinga Midian mihai chu thawha indo dingin nangni laia mi inrâlthuom rawhai se."
4,"Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.","Israel hnam po pohai laia hnam tina mi sâng khat pei indonaah in fe ding a nih,” tiin."
5,"So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.","Chuongchun, Israel mihai sâng tamtak laia inthawkin, hnam tina inthawkin sâng khat seng indonaa fe dingin sipai sîng khat le sâng hni an the suok a."
6,"And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun chi tina inthawka sâng khat seng le thiempu Eleazar naupa Phinehas hmun in- thienga bûrlebêlhai, thupêk vêlna dinga tawtawrâwthai chawiin in- donaa chun ân fetir a."
7,"And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they slew every male.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk angin, Midian mihai chu an do a, pasal po po an that a."
8,"And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.","An mi thathai laia chun Midian mihai lalhai khawm an ṭhang veh a; Midian mihai lal panga Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur le Reba hai, Beor naupa Balaam khawm kâwlhnâmin an that a."
9,"And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.","Israel thlahai chun Midian mi nuhmei le naupanghai chu salah an ṭhuoi a, chun, an ram po pohai, an berâm ruol po pohai, an thuom- hnawhai po po chu râllâk sum dingin an lâk a."
10,"And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.","An umna khuo po pohai, an riebûkhai po po an raw vawng a."
11,"And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.","Mihriem le ran, sal le râllâk sum po po an fepui vawng a."
12,"And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.","Chun, salhai, manhai, râllâk sumhai chu Mosie le Eleazar le Israel thla pungkhâwmhai kuoma Jeriko zâwn Jordan vapang Moab phai an riebûka chun an hung intlun a."
13,"And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.",Mosie le thiempu Eleazar le pungkhâwmhai po po chun riebûk puoah an lo va tuok a.
14,"And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.","Chun, Mosie chu sipai hotuhai, indonaa inthawka hunghai chunga chun a lunginsen a."
15,"And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?","Chuongchun, Mosie chun an kuomah, “Nuhmei chu damin in la hla vawng maw?"
16,"Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Jehovah.","Ngai ta u, Balaam remruot chun Peor chungchâng thuah Israel thlahai chu LALPA chunga bawsiet- na suktlungtuhai hieng hi an nih, LALPA mi pungkhâwmhai chunga khan hri ân lêng ta kha."
17,"Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.","Chuleiin, naupang laia pasal ta phawt chu that unla, nuhmei mi pâwl taphawt chu that bawk ro."
18,"But all the women-children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.",Nuhmei naupang mi la pâwl naw po po chu in ta dingin hla ro.
19,"And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.","Chun, khawhnâwmah ni sari riek unla, tukhawm mi that le mithi tâwk taphawt chu ni thum ni le ni sari niin inthien ro, nangni le in salhai khawm."
20,"And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.","Chun, thuomhnaw hrim hrim le savuna thil siem hrim hrim dâm, kêl hmula thil siem po po dâm, thinga siemhai po po chungthua chu inthien ding a nih,” a ta."
21,"And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses:","Chun, thiempu Eleazar chun indonaa fe indo mihai kuoma chun, “Hi hi LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk dân thuruot chu a nih;"
22,"howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,","iengkhawm ni sienla, rângka- chak dâm, tangkaruo dâm, dâr dâm, thîr dâm, rângva dâm, suon dâm;"
23,"everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water.","iengkhawm meia rawha se theilo chu meiah thawl thleng in ta, chuongchun, hung inthieng tâng a tih; iengkhawm ni sienla, inthienna tuia sukthieng ding a nih; chun, meia raw tuor theilo po chu tuiah in thawl thleng ding a nih."
24,"And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterward ye shall come into the camp.","Chun, a ni sari ni chun in puon sâwp in ta, chun, hung inthien in ta, chu zoa chun riebûkah in hung lût ding a nih,” a ta."
25,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
26,"Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the congregation;","“Nang le thiempu Eleazar leh, pungkhâwmhai pahnam ṭhuoituhai leh râllâk suma an lâk mihriemhai le ranhai chu tiem vawng unla,"
27,"and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation.","râllâk sum chu hmun hniah ṭhe unla, indonaa fe indo mihai ta dingin le, pungkhâwmhai ta dingin."
28,"And levy a tribute unto Jehovah of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks:","Indonaa fe râl kâp mia inthawk chun LALPA ta dinga sie pêk ding suktum pei unla, thil hring za nga peiah pakhat mihriema inthawk dâm, bâwnga inthawk dâm, sabeng- tunga inthawk dâm, berâm ruola inthawk dâmin."
29,"take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah’s heave-offering.","Chuonga a chenve an changa inthawk chun la unla, LALPA ta dinga athêna thên thilinhlâna dingin thiempu Eleazar pe ro."
30,"And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, even of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.","Chun, a chenve Israel thlahai chanpuol chu sâwmnga peiah pa- khat suktum la, mihriema inthawk dâm, bâwnga inthawk dâm, sa- bengtunga inthawk dâm, berâm ruola inthawk dâm, ran ruola inthawk dâmin; chuongchu LALPA biekbûk enkawltu Levi mihai pe rawh,” a ta."
31,And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah commanded Moses.,"Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang chun Mosie le thiempu Eleazar chun an thawh a."
32,"Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,","Sipaihaiin an lâk râllâk sum tiem loin an lâk chu berâm nuoi ruk sîng sari le sâng nga,"
33,"and threescore and twelve thousand oxen,",bâwng sîng sari le sâng hni;
34,"and threescore and one thousand asses,","sabengtung sîng ruk le sâng khat,"
35,"and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him.",mihriem chu nuhmei pasal la pâwl ngailo sîng thum le sâng hni an nih.
36,"And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:","Chun, a zâtve indonaa fehai chanvo chu, berâm nuoi thum sîng thum sâng sari le za nga a na;"
37,and Jehovah’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.,"chun, LALPA ta dinga chanvo berâm chu za ruk sâwmsari panga."
38,And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which Jehovah’s tribute was threescore and twelve.,"Bâwng chu sîng thum le sâng ruk a na, chutaka LALPA chanvo chu sâwmsari pahni a nih."
39,And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which Jehovah’s tribute was threescore and one.,"Sabengtung chu sîng thum le za nga a na, chutaka LALPA chanvo chu sâwmruk pakhat a nih."
40,And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Jehovah’s tribute was thirty and two persons.,"Mihriem chu sîng khat le sâng ruk an na, chutaka LALPA chanvo mihriem chu sâwmthum le pahni an nih."
41,"And Moses gave the tribute, which was Jehovah’s heave-offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses.",LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk angin chanvo LALPA ta dinga a thêna thên thilinhlân chu Mosie chun thiempu Eleazar chu a pêk a.
42,"And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred",Mosien râlkâp mihaia inthawka a sem Israel mihai chanvo chu–
43,"(now the congregation’s half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep,","mipui chanvo a zâtve chu– berâm nuoi thum sîng thum sâng sari le za nga,"
44,"and thirty and six thousand oxen,","bâwng sîng thum le sâng ruk,"
45,"and thirty thousand and five hundred asses,","sabengtung sîng thum le za nga,"
46,"and sixteen thousand persons),",mihriem sîng khat le sâng ruk an na.
47,"even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Israel chanvo a zâtvea inthawk chun Mosie chun mihriem le ran sâwmnga peiah pakhat a lâk a, LALPA thupêk angin LALPA biekbûk enkawltu Levi mihai chu a pêk a."
48,"And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses;","Chun, sipaihai chunga hotu, sâng chunga hotuhai, za chunga hotuhai chun Mosie an va hnai a."
49,"and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.","Mosie kuomah, “I siehlawhai hin kan kuta um indo mihai chu kan tiem a, tukhawm a kim naw kan um nawh a,"
50,"And we have brought Jehovah’s oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.","kan hringna ta dinga LALPA hmaa intlanna siemna dingin LALPA ta dinga thilinhlân ding miin an nei zâwng, rângkachaka siem incheina thil, kebunhai, bânbunhai, hming- namna kutsebihai, nabêhai, ṭhihai dâm khawm kan hung lâk a,” an tih a."
51,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.","Chun, Mosie le thiempu chun rângkachaka siem an thuom pohai chu an lâk a."
52,"And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.",Sâng chunga hotu le za chunga hotuhai rângkachak LALPA kuoma a thêna thên thilinhlâna an inhlân po po chu shekel sîng khat sâng ruk za sari le sâwmnga a nih.
53,"(For the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)",(Râlkâp mihai chun an râllâk sumhai chu mâni ta seng dinga la an na).
54,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.","Chun, Mosie le thiempu Eleazar chun sâng chunga hotu le za chunga hotuhai rângkachak chu an lâk a, Israel thlahai hriet zingna dingin intuokna puon inah LALPA hmaah an hung lâk a."
