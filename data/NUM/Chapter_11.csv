1,"And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.","Mipuihai chun LALPA na hrieta chun mi chier hmang angin thil ṭha naw takhai an hril hlak a; chu chu LALPA chun a lo hriet chun a lung a chawk tah a; chuongchun, LALPA mei chu anni lai chun a hung chawk a, an riebûk hmawr tieng chu a kâng ta dur dur el a."
2,"And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated.","Chuongchun, mipuihai chun Mosie an ko a; Mosie chu LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a, mei chu a rêm tah a."
3,"And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.","Chu hmun hminga chun Tabera an ta, LALPA mei chu anni lai chun a hung chawk leiin."
4,"And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?","Anni laia hnam danghai le innei pawlhai chun châkna nasatak an hung nei ta a; Israel thlahai khawm an ṭap nâwk a, “Tuin am sa fâk ding mi pêng a ta?"
5,"We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:","Nuom nuoma Aigupta rama nga dâm ei fâk hlak kha ei hriet zing a, fanghmahai, vaifanghmahai, purûn sel fâk mihai, purûn bâlhai le purûn vâr hai dâm,"
6,but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon.,"amiruokchu, tuhin ei thlin a ṭâwl zo an ta hi, iengkhawm beisei ding hrim hrim a um nawh: manna chau naw hi chu,” an ta."
7,"And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.","(manna chu koriendar mu ang, ân lang dâna chun lunghlu ang hi a nih."
8,"The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.","Mihai chun an rût khâwm a, rawtnawinaah an rawtnawi a, suma dâm an suk a, bêlah an suong a, bei dâmin an siem a, hang fâk chun hrieka zêu bei ang a nih."
9,"And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.",Riebûka chun zâna dâidâw a tlâkin manna chu a tla sa veh a).
10,"And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.","Chun, mipuihai chu a sûng sûngin an puon in kawtkhâr senga chun an ṭap ti Mosie chun a lo hriet a; chun, LALPA lung chu nasatakin a hung chawk tah a."
11,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?","Chun, Mosie khawm chu a lungni ta nawh a, chuongchun, LALPA kuomah, “Ieng leiin am i siehlaw hi i mi sukrinum a? Ieng leiin am i mit ka tlung nawh a, hieng mipui po po phurrik hi ka chunga innghat am i nih a?"
12,"Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?","Hieng mipuihai po po hi ka nauhai bêk am an nih? An pi le an puhai ṭawng inkhâma pêk i tiem rama ṭhuoi lût dingin, ‘Nau pawm- tuin nênê ne lai a pawm angin i ângsûngah pawm rawh,’ i mi ti ding ela ka ṭhuoi suok tâwl am an nih?"
13,"Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.","Hieng mipui po po pêk ding hi khâwlaia sa am nei ka ta? ‘Kan fâk dingin sâ mi pe rawh,’ tia ṭapin an mi thaw sih a."
14,"I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.","Hieng mipui po po hi mâni ngawt chun ka phur zo nawh, ka ta dingin a rik taluo a nih."
15,"And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.","Hieng anga i mi thaw ding chun mi lunginsiet la, mi sukhlum dai law law el la, mi sukrimsi ta naw khai,” a ta."
16,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Israelhai upa, mipuihai upa le an hotu nia i hriet mi sâwmsari hai ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi khâwm la, intuokna puon ina nang le ngîr hmunkhat dingin hung ṭhuoi rawh."
17,"And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.","Chuongchun, hung ṭum ka ta, chutaka chun hung bieng ka ti che; chun, nangmaa thlarau chu an chunga chun sieng ka ta; nanga khâta phur loin, mipuihai rikphur chu phurpui an ti che."
18,"And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.","Chun, nangin mipui kuomah, ‘Zînga ding hin insukthieng vawng unla, chuongchun, sa chu fa ngei in tih. Sa fâk ding tuin am mi pêng a ta? Aigupta rama inhawi ei ti vei leh, tiin LALPA na hrietah in ṭap a, chuleiin, LALPAIN sa pêng a ti cheu a, fa ngei in tih."
19,"Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,","Ni khat amanih, ni hni amanih, ni nga amanih, ni sâwm amanih, ni sâwmhni amanih el khawm ni loin,"
20,"but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?","thla khat pumhlûm, nghawk khawp rak le in hnâr kuoa suok rak khawpin fâng in tih; nangni laia um LALPA chu dit loa, Ieng dinga Aigupta rama kha suok am ei ni aw, tia a hmaa in ṭap leiin,’ ti rawh,” a ta."
21,"And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.","Mosie chun, “Ka umpui kea fe thei ṭhieu khawm mipui nuoi ruk an nih, ‘thla khat pumhlûm fâk ding sâ pêng ka tih,’ ti el chu."
22,"Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?","Berâm ruol le ran ruol khawm thatpêk ta ang inla, an khawp ding am a nih? Tuisuorieta nga po po khawm manpêk inla, an khawp ding am a nih?” a ta."
23,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah’s hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “LALPA kut chu a tawi ta am a nih? I chungah ka thu angin a tlung le tlung naw chu hre nghâl i tih,” a ta."
24,"And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.","Chuongchun, Mosie chu a suok a, LALPA thu chu mipuihai chu a hril a; mipuihai upahai sâwmsari chu a ko khâwm a, puon in vêla chun ân ngirtir a."
25,"And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.","Chuongchun, LALPA chu sûma chun a hung ṭum a, a hung biek a, amaa thlarau chu upa sâwmsari hai chunga chun a sieh a. Thlarâu chu an chunga a hung um phingleh thu an hril ta duol a; nisienlakhawm, chuong ang chun an thaw an thaw nâwk ta nawh."
26,"But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.","Amiruokchu, bûka chun mi pahni an um a, pakhat hming chu Eldad a na, mi dang hming chu Medad a nih; thlarau chu an chungah a um a, tiemhai laia ṭhang chu an na, puon ina ruok chun an va fe ve nawh a; bûka chun thu an hril a."
27,"And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.","Chuongchun, tlangvâl pakhat a va tlân a, Mosie a va hril a, “Eldad le Medad chun bûkah thu an hril an hril el,” a va ta."
28,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.","Chun, Nun naupa Josua, a tleirâwl tira inthawka Mosie rawng- bâwltu chun a dawn a, “Pu Mosie, khap el rawh,” a ta."
29,"And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah’s people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!","Mosie chun a kuomah, “Keia leia ngaimaw am i nih? LALPA mihai po po chu zâwlnei ni vawng hai sienla. LALPAIN an chungah a thla- rau chu sie seng sienla ti nâklaiah,” a ta."
30,"And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.","Chuongchun, Mosie chu bûka chun a lût nâwk a, ama le Israel mi upahai le chun."
31,"And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.","Chun, LALPA kuoma inthawk chun thli a hung hrâng a, tuisuorieta inthawk chun vamîm a hung lên a, bûk khingtieng ni khat lam, khing- tienga ni khat lam bawk dâpin bûk vêla chun tawng hni laia insângin ân tlâktir a."
32,"And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.","Mipuihai chun chu ni sûn- nithlâk le zânkhawvar le, a zingah sûnnithlak chun vamîm chu an va rût khâwm a; a rût tlâwm tak khawma homer sâwm a rût a, bûk vêla chun mâni ta dingin an em seng a."
33,"While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.","Chun, chu sa chu an fâk lai, an la fâk zo hmain, mipuihai chungah LALPA lung chu a hung chawk tah a, mipuihai chu hripui nasatakin LALPAIN a hrem tah a."
34,"And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.",Chu hmun hminga chun Ki- broth-hattaava an ta; chutaka chun châkna neituhai chu an phûm leiin.
35,From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.,"Chun, Kibroth-hattaavaa in- thawk chun mipuihai chu Heze- rothah an feh a, Hezerotha chun an um tah a."
