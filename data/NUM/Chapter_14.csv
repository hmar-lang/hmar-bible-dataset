1,"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.","Chuongchun, a pungkhâwm- hai po po chu rawl insuo meuin an ṭap a; chu zân chun mipuihai chu an ṭap an ṭap el a."
2,"And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!","Israel thlahai po po chu Mosie le Aron chunga chun an chier a; a pungkhâwmhai po po chun an kuomah, “Aigupta rama khan mi lo sukhlum thên kha ni ta lem sien aw! Annawleh, thlalêra hin mi sukhlum thên el lem sien aw!"
3,"And wherefore doth Jehovah bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?",Ieng dinga kâwlhnâma thi el dinga Pathienin hi rama hi mi ṭhuoi am a nih aw? Ei nuhmei ei nau le tehai hlak chu man el ding an ni âwm si a. Aigupta rama kîr nâwk el hi eini ta dingin a ṭha lem a ni naw am a nih?” an ta.
4,"And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.","Chuongchun, an inbiek tâwl a, “Hotu siem ei tiu khai, Aigupta ramah kîr nâwk el ei tiu,” an tih a."
5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.,"Chuongchun, Mosie le Aron chu Israel thla mipui pungkhâwm po pohai hmaa chun an bawkkhup a."
6,"And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:","Chun, Nun naupa Josua le Jephunne naupa Kaleb, ram enthla- tuhai laia ṭhang vehai chun an puonhai an keithlêr a;"
7,"and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.","Israel thla mipui pungkhâwm po pohai kuoma chun, “Enthla dingin kan va fang suok ram chu ram ṭhatak a nih."
8,"If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.","Ei chunga hin LALPA a lâwm chun, chu rama chun mi ṭhuoi a ta, mi pêng a tih; nênêtui le khuoizu luong- na ram chu."
9,"Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.","LALPA chungah hel naw phawt el unla, chu rama mihai khawm chu ṭi hlek naw ro, ei bu ding an ni el annâwm, an inhumhimna chu teplo mei mei a nih; LALPA chu ei kuomah a um annâwm; anni chu ṭi naw ro,” tiin an hril a."
10,But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.,"Nisienlakhawm, a pungkhâwm- hai po po chun lunga dêng an rawt a. Chuongchun, LALPA ropuina chu intuokna puon inah Israel thlahai po po hmaa chun a hung inlang a."
11,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie kuomah, “Hieng mipuihai hin ieng chen am mi ngainêp an ta, anni laia inchikna ka thaw hlak sa khawm ieng chen am mi ring loin an um ding a na? Hriin hrem ka ta, suklungzîng ka tih;"
12,"I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.","nangmaa hin an nêka ropui le thilthawthei lem hnam inngir ka tih,” a ta."
13,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;","Mosie ruok chun LALPA kuom- ah, “Aigupta mihaiin hre pal rawi an tih; hieng mipuihai hi ṭawng inkhâma a tiem rama chun i thil- thawtheinaa i ṭhuoi suok an ni sih a;"
14,"and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people; for thou Jehovah art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.","hi rama mihai hi hril an ta; hieng mipuihai lai hin i um ti an hriet tah a; hmaisan meuin an hmu ta si cheh a; i sûm chu an chungah a um hlak a; chun, sûnah sûmngîr, zânah meiin an hma i ṭhuoi hlak sih a."
15,"Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,","Hieng mipuihai hi i sukhlum phier chun i hming inthang hretu hnamhai chun,"
16,"Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.","‘LALPA chun hieng mipuihai hi ṭawng inkhâma a tiem rama chun a ṭhuoi thei naw leiin thlalêrah a sukhlum a nih,’ tiin hril rawi an tih."
17,"And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,",Hieng anga i lo hril ta lei khan i thilthawtheina chu sukbutling hrâm dingin ka hung ngên che a nih.
18,"Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.","‘LALPA chu lung inuoitak, zainêmna hau, rîtlonahai le bawsiet- nahai ngaidam hlak, thiemlo changhai insuoktir el ngailo, pahai rîtlona leia nauhai, nauhai nau nâwk chen, suon thumna le suon lina chen khawma hrem hlak a nih,’ ti kha."
19,"Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.","I zainêmna a nasat ang ngei le, Aigupta rama inthawka tu chena i ngaidam ang hin mipuihai rîtlona hi ngaidam ta khai,” a ta."
20,"And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word:","Chun, LALPA chun, “I thu ang chun ngaidam ka tih;"
21,"but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;","amiruokchu, ka hring zing ang le Lalpa ropuinain hnuoi pumpui a la suksip vawng ding ang bawkin thu ka tiem,"
22,"because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;","Aigupta ram le thlalêra ka ropuina le ka thilmak thawhai hmua, chuongsa khawma vawi sâwm zet mi la fieh a, ka thu la pawm lo mi po pohai hin,"
23,"surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:","an thlatuhai kuoma inkhâma ram ka tiem chu hmu naw tawp an ta, anni laia mi ngainêptu hrim hrim khawma hmu bawk naw ni hai."
24,"but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.","Ka siehlaw Kaleb ruok hi chu, lungril danglam puta titakzeta a mi zui leiin, a va fena rama chun ṭhuoi ka ta, a thlahai chun hluong an tih."
25,"Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.","Tuhin, Amalek mihai le Kanaan mihai chu ruoma chun an um a, zinga khin kir nâwk unla, Tuisuoriet Sen lampui tieng thlalêrah lût ro,” a ta."
26,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie le Aron a biek a,"
27,"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.","“Hieng mi rilo pungkhâwmhai, ka chunga chier hlakhai hi ieng chen am dâwng ka ti aw? Israel thlahai chierna, ka chunga an chiernahai chu ka hriet deh."
28,"Say unto them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:","An kuomah, ‘ka hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ka na hriet ngeia in hril angtakin in chungah thâwng ka ta; in ruonghai chu thlalêra hin um a ta;"
29,"your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,","nangni laia mi tiem ta sa po po, kum sâwmhni chen chungtieng mi ka chunga chierhai po po chu,"
30,"surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.","bân phar meua, Inumtir ka ti cheu, ka tina rama chun Jephunne naupa Kaleb le Nun naupa Josua chau naw chu lût naw tawp in tih."
31,"But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.","Amiruokchu, man el ding nîng an ta, in iti in nau le tehai ruok hi chu ṭhuoi lût ka tih, in dit naw ram chu hluong an tih."
32,"But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.",Nangni ruok chu in ruonghai chu hi thlalêra hin um a tih.
33,"And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.","In nauhai chu thlalêrah kum sâwmli intawi intawi an ta, thlalêra in ruong hai a riral hmakhat chun in ringum nawna lei chun tuor an tih."
34,"After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.","Ram in va enthlâk ni zât; ni sâwmli chu, ni khat aiah kum khat pei, kum sâwmli sûng zet in baw- sietna chu tuor phâng in ta, chuong- chun, ka lungni nawzie hi hre tâng in tih."
35,"I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.","Kei LALPA hin mi rilo pung- khâwm, kei mi dodâla pungkhâwm- hai chungah hi hi thâwng ka tih ka lo ti tah a; hi thlalêra hin bohmang an ta, chutaka chun thîng an ta, LALPAIN a tih,’ ti ro,” tiin."
36,"And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,","Chun, ram enthla dinga Mosie- in a tir, hung kîr nâwk a ram chanchin a ṭha naw tienga hung hril a, a chunga pungkhâwmhai inchier- tirtu,"
37,"even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.",ram a ṭha naw tienga hung hriltuhai chu LALPA hmaah hriin an thi tah a.
38,"But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.",Ram enthla dinga fe Nun naupa Josua le Jephunne naupa Kaleb ruok chu an thi ve nawh a.
39,And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.,"Mosien chuong thuhai chu Israel thlahai po po chu a hril a; chuongchun, mipuihai chu an lung- ngai ta hle el a."
40,"And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned.","Chuongchun, zîngkâr an tho a, tlâng sîpa chun an hang feh a, “Ngai ta, hi kan hung a nih, LALPAIN a mi tiemna hmuna chun fêng kan tih, kan lo suol tah a nih,” an ta."
41,"And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?","Chun, Mosien, “Tluongtlungna ni naw ni ti hriet zing sain iengdinga LALPA thupêk in bawsiet ding am a na?"
42,"Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.","Nangni lai LALPA a um si nawh a, hmêlmahai lo that el dingin hang fe naw ro."
43,"For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.","In hmaa khin Amalek mihai le Kanaan mihai an um a na, kâwl- hnâma sâthlum ni el in tih. LALPA chu in nghatsan tâk leiin nangni lai LALPA chu um naw ni,” a ta."
44,"But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.","Nisienlakhawm, tlâng sîpa chun fe an tum ṭâl a; amiruokchu, LALPA thuthlungna bâwm le Mosie chu bûka inthawk chu an suok ve nawh."
45,"Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah.","Chuongchun, chu tlânga um Amalek mihai le Kanaan mihai chu an hung thla a, an thawh a, Horma chenin an hnawt a, an vuokthlûk rum el a."
