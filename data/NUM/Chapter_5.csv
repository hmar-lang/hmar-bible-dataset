1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,"Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead:",“Israel thlahai chu riebûka inthawkin inphâr po po le thipût po po le mithi leia pawrche taphawt chu sie suok vawng dingin thu pe rawh
3,"both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell.","a nuhmei a pasalin i sie suokin riebûk puoah i sie ding a nih; a lai taka ka umna hlak an riebûk chu an sukpawrche nawna dingin,” tiin"
4,"And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp; as Jehovah spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.","Chuongchun, Israel thlahai chun chuong ang chun an thawh a, riebûk puoah an sie dawk a; LALPAIN Mosie kuoma a hril angin Israel thlahai chun an thawh a."
5,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
6,"Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Jehovah, and that soul shall be guilty;","“Israel thlahai kuomah hril la, ‘Pasalin amanih, nuhmeiin amanih Lalpa ringna bawsein mihriem thaw hlak suol ieng el khawm a thaw chun, chu mi chu thiemnaw chang a nih;"
7,"then he shall confess his sin which he hath done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty.","a suksuolnaa chun thupha a chawi ding a nih; chun, a suksuol man chu kimtaka thung ding a na, a hmun ngaa ṭhea hmun khat a suk- suolnapa chu a pêk belsa ding a nih."
8,"But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made unto Jehovah shall be the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.","Amiruokchu, mi chun suol man intêltu ding laibung a nei naw chun, a suksuol man chu LALPA kuomah inhlân a ta, thiempu chanpuol ding nîng a tih, a ta dinga intlanna berâmchal a siem bâka chun."
9,"And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his.","Chun, Israel thlahai thil inthieng a thêna thên thilinhlân po po, thiempu kuoma inhlân taphawt chu thiempu chanpuol nîng a ta."
10,"And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.","Mi tin thil inthieng chu thiempu chanpuol nîng a tih, miin thiempu a pêk taphawt chu thiempu chanpuol nîng a tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
11,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
12,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,","“Israel thlahai kuomah hril la, an kuomah, ‘Nuhmeiin khaw dang nghain a pasal suolsan sienla,"
13,"and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she be not taken in the act;","miin zâlpui sienla, a pasalin hre si naw sienla: chuong anga a um zing a, insukpawrche zing pum siin, lân phuong si loin, hretu khawm um si lo, man ni naw sienla;"
14,"and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:","chun, thîkna lungril putin a nuhmei chu thîkin lo insukpawrche ta si naw sienla amanih,"
15,"then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.","chuong ang a ni chun a pasal chun a ta dinga thilinhlân buṭei beiphit epha hmun sâwma ṭhea hmun khat chawiin a nuhmei chu thiempu kuomah a ṭhuoi ding a nih, hriek a buok ding a ni nawh a, riminhnik a nâl ding a ni bawk nawh; thîk inthâwina fâkmi thilinhlân, hriet zingna thilinhlân rîtlona hriet suokna a ni leiin."
16,"And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah:","Thiempu hung ṭhuoi a ta, LALPA hmaa chun inngîrtir a tih;"
17,"and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water.","thiempu chun pil bêlin tui inthieng lâng a ta, biekbûk ṭuong pilvut lâng a ta, tuia chun phul a tih."
18,"And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and let the hair of the woman’s head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy: and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causeth the curse.","Thiempu chun nuhmei chu LALPA hmaah inngirtir a ta, a sam inthlatir a ta, hriet zingna fâkmi thilinhlân, thîk inthâwina thilinhlân chu a kutah inchawitir a ta; thiempu chun ṭawngsie intlungtirtu khâkna tui chu chawi a tih."
19,"And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse.","Chun, thiempu chun nuhmei chu ṭawng inkhâmtir a ta, nuhmei kuoma chun, I pasal ni lo mi dang tukhawma an zâlpui naw cheh a, pawrchena tieng i la fe pet naw chun ṭawngsie intlungtirtu, hi tui khaa inthawk hin fihlîm i tih."
20,"But if thou have gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband:","Amiruokchu, khaw dang nghaa i lo pawrche a, i pasal ni lo mi tuin amanih a zâlpui che chun fihlîm naw ti nih, a ti ding a nih."
21,"then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell;","Chun, thiempu chun nuhmei chu vau a ta, ṭawng inkhâmtir a ta, nuhmei kuomah thiempu chun, LALPAIN i êlpui a sukthlam a, i phîng a sukvûng chun LALPAIN i chipuihai lai ṭawngsephurin siem raw se che."
22,"and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy body to swell, and thy thigh to fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.","Ṭawngsie intlungtirtu hi tui hi i rilah lût a ta, i phing sukvûng a ta, i êlpui sukchêr a tih, tîng a ta; chun, nuhmei chun, Amen, Amen a lo ti ding a nih."
23,"And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness:","Chun, thiempu chun chuong ṭawngsie thuhai chu lekhabuah ziek a ta, khâkna tui chun inchieng a tih:"
24,and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.,"chun, nuhmei chu ṭawngsie in- tlungtirtu khâkna tui chu indâwn- tir bawk a tih: chuongchun, ṭawng- sie intlungtirtu tui chu a phîng sûngah lût a ta, nasatakin hung nâng a tih."
25,"And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the meal-offering before Jehovah, and bring it unto the altar:","Chun, thiempu chun thîkna thilinhlân chu nuhmei kuta inthawk lâng a ta, LALPA hmaah fâkmi thilinhlân chu thên a ta; mâichâma chun fepui a ta,"
26,"and the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.","thiempu chun fâkmi thilinhlân hriet zingna ding chu vei khat lâng a ta, mâichâma chun rawng a ta, chu zo chun tui chu nuhmei chu ân dâwntir ding a nih."
27,"And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her body shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.","Tui a hang indâwntir chun a lo pawrche a, a pasal chunga thil a lo suksuol chun ṭawngsie intlungtirtu tui chu a phîng sûngah lût a ta, nasatakin hung nâng a ta, a phîng chu hung invûng a ta, a êlpui chu hung chêr a ta, chuongchun, nuhmei chu a chipuihai lai ṭawngsephur hung nîng a tih."
28,"And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.","Amiruokchu, nuhmei chu a lo pawrche nawh a, ân thieng chun fihlîm a ta, nau vawn thei pei hung nîng a tih."
29,"This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled;","Hi hi, nuhmei, khaw dang nghaa, a pasal ni lo, mi dang le lo insukpawrche amanih,"
30,"or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.","pasalin thîkna lungril a hung put a, a nuhmei a thîk amanih a rêl dân chu a nih; chuongchun, LALPA hmaah ṭhuoi a ta, thiempu chun hieng dân ang po po hin a chungah a thaw ding a nih."
31,"And the man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.","Chuongchun, pasal chu rîtlonaa chun fihlîm a ta, nuhmei chun a suolna maw chu phur a tih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
