1,"Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;","Reuben le Gad thlahai chun ram an hau hle a; chun, Jazer ram le Gilead ram an hmu chun, a hmun chu ran ta dinga hmun ṭhatak niin an hriet a;"
2,"the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,","chuongchun, Gad thlahai le Reuben thlahai chun Mosie le thiem- pu Eleazar le pungkhâwmhai ṭhuoi- tuhai chu an va biek a,"
3,"Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,","“Astaroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimra, Hesbon, Eleale, Sebam, Nebo le Beon dâm–"
4,"the land which Jehovah smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and thy servants have cattle.","Israel pungkhâwmhai hmaa LALPAIN a suktlâwm ramhai chu - ran ta dinga ṭhatak ram a na; chun, i siehlawhai hin ran kan nei a,"
5,"And they said, If we have found favor in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over the Jordan.","rem i ti zâwng a ni chun hi ram hi kan hluo dingin mi pe la, Jordan râl mi ṭhuoi kai da el raw khai,” an ta."
6,"And Moses said unto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here?","Chun, Mosie chun Gad thlahai le Reuben thlahai kuoma chun, “In unauhai chu indonaah fêng an ta, nangni chu hitaka hin in lo um el ding maw?"
7,And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah hath given them?,Iengdinga LALPAIN a pêk rama lût lo dinga Israel thlahai lungril in sukṭi zing am a ni le?
8,"Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.","Kades-barneaa inthawka ram va enthla dinga ka ti khan hieng ang bawk hin in puhai chun an ta,"
9,"For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Jehovah had given them.","Eskol ruom an hung tlung khan ram chu an hung hmuh a, LALPAIN ram a pêka chun an lût nâwna dingin Israel thlahai lungril chu an sukṭi- pêk a."
10,"And Jehovah’s anger was kindled in that day, and he sware, saying,","Chuongchun, chu ni chun LAL- PA lung chu a chawk a, inkhâmin,"
11,"Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:","‘Aigupta rama inthawka hung suok, kum sâwmhni chin chungtieng mi hrim hrim chu Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai kuoma inkhâma pêk ka tiem ram hrim hrim chu tukhawma hmu naw ni hai; an mi zui tak tak naw leiin;"
12,"save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Jehovah.","Keniz mi Jephunne naupa Kaleb le Nun naupa Josua hai chau naw chun, anni chun LALPA chu an zui tak tak leiin,’ tiin."
13,"And Jehovah’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of Jehovah, was consumed.","Chun, Israelhai chunga chun LALPA lung chu a chawk a, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw thawtu suon po po chu an bohmang vawng hmakhat chun thlalêrah kum sâwmli ân vâkvaitir a."
14,"And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel.","Chun, ngai ta u, Israelhai chunga LALPA lungsenna ṭiumtak chu belsain nangni suon suolhai hin in puhai ai in aw tah a."
15,"For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye will destroy all this people.","LALPA zui loa in um meu chun annirawi hi thlalêrah ân umtir nâwk el ding a nih. Hieng mihai po po hi in sukbohmang el ding a nih,” a ta."
16,"And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:","Anni chun an va hnai a, a kuomah, “Hitaka hin kan ran ta dingin berâm huonhai le kan nau le tehai ta dingin khuohai siem kan ta."
17,"but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.",Keini ruok chu an hmun ding ei tlung hmakhata Israel thlahai hmaa fe pei dingin inrâlthuom diem kan ta; hi rama mihai lei hin kan nau le têhai chu kul nei khuoahai chun um an ta.
18,"We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.",Israel thla mi tin an hmun hluo ding an hluo hmakhat chu kan in tieng fe naw ning ungah.
19,"For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.","Kan hluo ding chu hi tieng râl Jordan sak tieng a ni leiin Jordan râl khingtieng le a khêl tieng chu hluopui naw ning ungah,” an ta."
20,"And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,","Chun, Mosien an kuomah, “Chuong anga in thawh a, indonaa LALPA hmaa fe dinga in inrâlthuom a, a hmaa inthawka a hmêlma hai a hnawt suok a,"
21,"and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,","LALPA hmaa ram chu hne a ni hmakhata nangni laia inrâlthuomhai po poin LALPA hmaa Jordan in kai vawng chun,"
22,"and the land is subdued before Jehovah; then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and towards Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before Jehovah.","nakie leh in tieng la fêng in ta, LALPA chunga le Israelhai chungah thiemlo loin in um ding a nih; chuong- chun, hi ram hi LALPA hmaa in hluo ding nîng a tih."
23,"But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah; and be sure your sin will find you out.","Amiruokchu, chuong anga in thaw naw chun, ngai ta u, LALPA chunga suol nîng in ta, in suol chun hmu suok ngei ngei a ti cheu ti hre ro."
24,"Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.","In nau le têhai ta dingin khuo- hai siem unla, in berâmhai ta dingin huonhai siem un la, in hril ang chun thaw ro khai,” a ta."
25,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.","Chun, Gad thlahai le Reuben thlahai chun Mosie kuomah, “I siehlawhai hin kan pu thupêk ang chun thâwng kan tih."
26,"Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;","Kan nuhmei, kan nau le têhai, kan berâm ruolhai, kan ran ruolhai po po chu Gilead ram khuoahai hin lo um an ta;"
27,"but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord saith.","amiruokchu, i siehlaw, indo dinga inrâlthuomhai po po chu kan pu hril ang chun LALPA hmaah va kai kan tih,” an ta, an hril a."
28,"So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun an chungchâng thua chun thiempu Eleazar hai, Nun naupa Josua hai, Israel pahnam ṭhuoituhai chu thu a pêk a."
29,"And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before Jehovah, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:","Chun, Mosie chun an kuomah, “Gad thlahai le Reuben thlahai indo dinga inrâlthuomhai po po hin LALPA hmaa Jordan vadung an kai- pui cheu a, ram chu in inhmin chun Gilead ram chu an hluo dingin in pêk ding a nih;"
30,"but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.","amiruokchu, inrâlthuoma an kaipui naw cheu chun Kanaan ram- ah nangni lai ṭhang ve el an tih,” a ta."
31,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.","Chun, Gad thlahai le Reuben thlahai chun, “I siehlawhai kuoma LALPAIN a hril ang chun thâwng kan tih;"
32,"We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.","inralthuoma LALPA hmaa kaiin Kanaan ramah lût kan ta, chuongchun, kan ram hluo ding chu Jordan vadung khêl tieng la ni zing a tih,” tiin an dawn a."
33,"And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities thereof with their borders, even the cities of the land round about.","Chun, Mosie chun Gad thlahai le Reuben thlahai le Josef nau Manasse thla hnam zâtve hai chu Amor lal Sihon ram dâm, Basan lal Og ram, chuong ramhai chu a khuo um po pohai leh a vêla rama khuohai le chun a pêk a."
34,"And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,","Chun, Gad thlahai chun Dibon dâm, Ataroth dâm, Aroer dâm,"
35,"and Atroth-shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,","Atrothsophan dâm, Jazer dâm, Jogbeha dâm,"
36,"and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.","Beth-nimrah dâm, Betharan dâm an indin a, khawpui kul neihai, berâm huon dâm leh."
37,"And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,","Chun, Reuben thlahai chun Hesbon dâm, Eleale dâm, Kiriathaim dâm,"
38,"and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names unto the cities which they builded.","Nebo dâm, Baal-meon dâm, (a hminghai hi sukdanglam a ni tah), Sibma dâm an indin a; an khuo siemhai chu hming dang an in- put a."
39,"And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were therein.","Chun, Manasse naupa Makir thlahai chu Gilead rama chun an feh a, an lâk a. Amor mihai chutaka umhai chu an lâkpêk a."
40,And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.,"Chun, Mosie chun Gilead ram chu Manasse naupa Makir chu a pêk a, chutaka chun a um a."
41,"And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair.","Chun, Manasse naupa Jair chun chutaka khuohai chu a va lâk a, Havot-Jair ân bûk a."
42,"And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.","Chun, Noba chun Kenath a va lâk a, a khawperhai leh, ama hming chawiin Noba ân bûk a."
