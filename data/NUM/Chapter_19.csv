1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie le Aron a biek a,"
2,"This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke.","“Hi hi LALPA thupêk dân chu a nih: Israel thlahai chu bâwngla sen, demkailo, hmêlhemlo, ringkawl la bât dêr lo hung kei dingin hril rawh."
3,"And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:","Thiempu Eleazar pêng i ta, ama chun riebûk puoah ṭhuoi suok a ta, a hmaa chun that a ni ding a nih."
4,"and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.","Thiempu Eleazar chun a kut- pârin a thisen chu lâng a ta, intuokna puon in hma tienga chun vawi sari thêng a tih."
5,"And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:","Chun, mi tuin amanih bâwngla chu a mithmuah râwng a ta, a vun dâm, a sa dâm, a thisen dâm, a êk dâm leh râwng a tih."
6,"and the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.","Thiempu chun sidar thing le husop le patzai lâng a ta, bâwgla an râwnaa chun a peilût ding a nih."
7,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.","Chun, thiempu chun a silfênhai sâwp a ta, insil a ta, chu zoa chun riebûka chun fêng a ta, zântieng chenin thiempu chu thienglo nîng a tih."
8,"And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.","A rawtu khawm chun a silfênhai sâwp a ta, insil a ta, zântieng chenin thienglo nîng a tih."
9,"And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.","Insukpawrchenaw mi pakhatin bâwngla vâm chu la khâwm a ta, riebûk puo hmun faiah sieng a ta; chuonghai chu, suol thai hmangna dinga, Israel thla mipuihai inthieng nawna sukfaina tui siemna dingin sie ṭhat nîng an tih."
10,"And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.","Chun, bâwngla vâm la khâwm- tu chun a silfênhai sâwp a ta, zântieng chenin thienglo nîng a tih. Hi hi Israel thlahai le hnam dang an kuoma umhai ta dinga kumkhaw dân ding a nih."
11,He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:,“Tu ruong khawm themtu chu ni sari thienglo nîng a tih.
12,"the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.","Ama chu ni thum ni le ni sari ni chun inthien a ta, thieng ni tâng a tih, amiruokchu, ni thum ni le ni sari nia an thien naw chun ni sari ni khawm chun thieng la ni naw ni."
13,"Whosoever toucheth a dead person, the body of a man that hath died, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.","Tukhawma tu ruong khawm a thema ân thien naw chun LALPA biekbûk a sukpawrche a nih; ama chu Israel mihaia inthawka sât thlâk ding a nih; inthienna tui chu a chunga the lo a ni leiin thieng naw a nih, ân thieng nawna chu a chungah a la um a nih."
14,"This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.",“Mi puon inah a thi chun hi hi a dân ding a nih: puon in lût taphawt le puon in sûnga um taphawt chu ni sari thienglo nîng a tih.
15,"And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.","Chun, bûrlebêl inhawng a sîn- naa sîn lo chu thienglo a nih."
16,"And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.","Tukhawmin daitâma kâwl- hnâma that amanih, mithi ruong amanih, mihriem ru amanih, thlân amanih a tâwk chun ni sari thienglo a nih."
17,And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:,"An thieng nawhai puola suol thâwina vâm chu lâng a ta,"
18,"and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:","bêlah tuikhur tui leh sung a tih. Chun, mi thiengin husop lâng a ta, tuia chun inchieng a ta, puon in dâm, bûrlebêl po pohai, chutaka mi um po pohai, ru amanih, that ruong amanih, mithi ruong amanih, thlân amanih tâwktuhai chu thêng a ta;"
19,"and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.","chun, mi thiengin ni thum ni le ni sari niin mi thieng naw chu thêng a ta, ni sari ni chun sukthieng a ta; a silfênhai sâwp a ta, insil a ta, zân- tieng chun hung inthieng tâng a tih."
20,"But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water for impurity hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.","Mi thienglo, inthien lo ruok chun LALPA hmun inthieng a suk- pawrche leiin ama chu pungkhâwm- hai laia inthawka sât thlâk ding a nih; inthienna tuia the lo a na, thienglo a nih."
21,"And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he that toucheth the water for impurity shall be unclean until even.","Hi hi an ta dinga kumkhaw dân ding a nih; inthienna tuia thea um taphawt chun an silfênhai sâwp an ta, chun, inthienna tui tawk taphawt chu zântieng chenin thienglo nîng a tih."
22,And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.,"Mi thiengloin a tâwk taphawt chu thienglo ni ve pei a ta; chun, chu tâwktu taphawt chu zântieng chenin thienglo nîng a tih,” tiin."
