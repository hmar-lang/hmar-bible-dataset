22,"And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,","“Chun, hieng thupêk po po, LALPAIN Mosie kuoma a hril,"
23,"even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;","LALPAIN thu a pêk tira inthawka in thlahai chena dinga Mosie hmanga thu a pêk po pohai cheu hi in pawm nawh a, in bawsiet chun hieng ang hi hung nîng a ta;"
24,"then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering.","pungkhâwmhaiin hre loa thawpal a ni chun, pungkhâwmhai po po chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân LALPA ta dinga riminhnikah bâwng tuoi pakhat inhlân an ta, a dân pângngai angin beiphit thilinhlân le dâwnmi thilinhlân leh, suol thâwina dingin kêlchal pakhat an inhlân sa bawk ding a nih."
25,"And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, for their error:","Chun, thiempu chun Israel thlahai pungkhâwm po po ta ding chun inremna siem a ta, ngaidam nîng an tih, thawpal a ni lei le, an thilinhlân LALPA ta dinga meia thilinhlân le an suol aia suol thâwina an inhlân ta leiin."
26,"and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.","Israel thla pungkhâwmhai po po chu ngaidam nîng an ta, anni laia hnam dang umhai khawm; mipui po po chun an thawpal a ni leiin."
27,"And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering.","Mi malin hre loin thil a suksuol chun, suol thâwina dingin kêl late pakhat kum khat mi ân hlân ding a nih."
28,"And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.","Hre loa LALPA hmaa suksuoltu ta ding chun thiempu chun inremna a siem ding a nih; chuongchun, ngaidam nîng a tih."
29,"Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.",Hre loa suksuoltu ta dingin Israel thla chu rama pienghai ta dingin le hnam dang mi anni laia umhai ta ding khawma dân angkhat in nei ding a nih.
30,"But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.","Amiruokchu, ân dittâwk leia thaw a ni ruok chun, chu rama pieng amanih, hnam dang amanih khawm ni sienla, LALPA hrilsie a nih; ama chu a chipuihai laia inthawk sât thlâk ding a nih."
31,"Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.","LALPA thu chu a hmusit a, a thupêk chu a bawsiet leiin ama chu sât thlâk ṭhuoi ding a nih, a rîtlona maw chu ama ngeiin phur a tih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
32,"And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.",Israel thlahai thlalêra an um lai chun mi pakhat châwlnia thing inkhâwm hi an hmuh a.
33,"And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.",A thing inkhâwm hmutuhai chun Mosie le Aron le pungkhâwmhai kuoma chun an ṭhuoi a.
34,"And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.",Ieng anga thaw ding am a ni ti la puonglo a ni leiin intângna inah an khum a.
35,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.","LALPAIN Mosie kuomah, “Ama chu sukhlum ngei ngei ding a nih, riebûk puoah pungkhâwmhai po po chun lungin an dêng ding a nih,” a ta."
36,"And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang chun pungkhâwmhai po po chun riebûkah an ṭhuoi a, lungin an dêng hlum tah a."
37,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
38,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue:","“Israel thlahai kuomah, an thlahai chena an puon hmawra a hmawrkai siem ding le, a hmawr tin reia chun a dumpâwl sie dingin hril rawh;"
39,"and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot;","chu rei chu in en hlak a, LALPA thupêk po po in hriet zinga in zâwmna ding le nawchizawra in um hlak anga in lungril dit zâwng le in mit la zâwng hnawta in um nawna dingin le,"
40,"that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.","ka thupêkhai po po chu in hriet zing a, in zâwm a, in Pathien ta dinga in inthieng theina dingin a nih."
41,"I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.","In Pathien ni dinga Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu cheu LALPA in Pathien ka nih. Kei hi LALPA in Pathien chu ka nih,” tiin."
