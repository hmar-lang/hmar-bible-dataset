1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,","LALPA chun Aigupta rama in- thawka an suok chen kum hnina thla khatnaah Sinai thlalêra chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.,“Israel thlahai chun Fekân ruoiṭhe chu a hunbi peiah nei raw se.
3,"In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.","A hunbiah, hi thla ni sâwmpali zântieng in nei ding a nih; chu- taka thaw dinga ruot ang po po le, a dân ang po po chu in nei ding a nih,” tiin."
4,"And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Israel thlahai chu Fekân ruoiṭhe chu nei dingin a hril a."
5,"And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.","Chuongchun, Sinai thlalêra chun thla khatna ni sâwmpali ni zântieng fekân ruoiṭhe chu an nei tah a; LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang po po chun Israel thlahai chun an thawh a."
6,"And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:","Chun, tuhai amanih mithi ruong leia thieng naw an lo um a. Chu ni chun fekân ruoiṭhenaa chun an ṭhang ve thei nawh a. Chuongchun, chu ni chun Mosie le Aron hmaa chun an feh a."
7,"and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the children of Israel?","Chuonghai chun a kuomah, “Mithi ruong leiin kan inthieng naw a ni tah a, iengleiin am Israel thlahai laia a hunbia LALPA kuoma thilin- hlân kan inhlân ding in mi khap a na?” an tih a."
8,"And Moses said unto them, Stay ye, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.","Mosie chun an kuomah, “Lo to ta u, in chungchâng thuah LALPAIN ieng angin am thu a pêk ding hang hre phawt ei tih,” a ta."
9,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah.","“Israel thlahai kuomah, ‘Nang- ni laia mi khawm, in thlahai laia mi khawm, mithi ruong leia thieng naw amanih, lo thanghmang amanih an um hlau chun LALPA ta dinga Fekân ruoiṭhe chu an nei ve hrim hrim ding a nih."
11,In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:,Thla hnina ni sâwmpali ni zântieng an nei ding a nih. Chawl ṭhanglo bei hlohna kha leh an fâk ding a nih.
12,"they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.","A zînga dingin a iengkhawm an sie ding a ni nawh a, a ru khawm an sukthliek ding a ni bawk nawh; Fekân ruoiṭhe thaw dinga ruot ang po po chu an thaw ding a nih."
13,"But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.","Amiruokchu, thieng si, thang- hmangna khawm nei chuong loa Fekân ruoiṭhea ṭhang lo chu a chipuihai laia inthawk sât thlâk nîng a ta; a hunbia LALPA kuoma thilin- hlân chu ân hlân naw leiin ama chun a suol maw chu phur a tih."
14,"And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land.","Chun, hnam dang mi in kuoma umin, LALPA ta ding Fekân ruoiṭhea ṭhang ve a nuom chun Fekân ruoi- ṭhea thaw dinga ruot le a dân angin an thaw ding a nih; hi rama mi hrim hrim le hnam dang mihai ta dingin dân angkhat in nei ding a nih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a ta."
15,"And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.","Chuongchun, biekbûk indin ni chun biekbûk, inhriettirna puon in chu sûmin a tuom mup a, chun, zântieng chun biekbûk chunga chun meichawk ang el hi a zîng zîngkâr chenin a um a."
16,"So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.","Chuong ang chun a um zing a; sûm chun a tuom zing a, zâna chun mei angin ân lâng a."
17,"And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.","Sûmin puon in chu ân kiengsan po leh, Israel thlahai chun fe zai an rêl hlak a; chun, sûm a ngirna hmuna phawt chun Israel thlahai chun umhmun an khuor hlak."
18,"At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.","LALPA thupêkin Israel thlahai chu an fe pei a, LALPA thupêk bawk- in umhmun an khuor hlak a; biekbûk chunga sûm chu a um sûng po umhmun an khuor zing a."
19,"And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not.","Biekbûk chunga sûm chu sâwttak a um chun Israel thlahai chun LALPA thu chu an zâwm a, an fe ngai nawh."
20,"And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed.","A châng chun sûm chu biekbûk chunga chun sâwt nawtê chau a um hlak a; chuongchun, LALPA thupêk angin an fe hlak."
21,"And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.","A châng chun sûm chu zân- tienga inthawkin zîngtieng chen a um a; chun, zîngkâra sûm chu ân vawr sâng chun an fe hlak a; ni khat chau amanih, zân khat chau amanih uma sûm chu ân vawr sâng chun an fe el hlak a."
22,"Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.","Biekbûk chungah sûm chu ni hni amanih, thla khat amanih, kum khat amani khawm a um chun, chutaka a um zing chun Israel thla- hai chun umhmun an khuor zing a, an fe ngai nawh a; ân vawr sâng ruok chun an fe hlak."
23,"At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.","LALPA thupêkin umhmun an khuor hlak a, LALPA thupêkin an fe hlak; Mosie hmanga LALPA thupêkin LALPA thu chu an zâwm a."
