3,"Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against Jehovah in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.","“Thlalêra khan kan pa a thih a, LALPA thaw dinga pungkhâwm pâwl, Kora pâwla khan a ṭhang ve nawh a, nisienlakhawm, ama suol leiin a thih a, naupasal khawm a nei nawh a."
4,"Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.","Nau pasal nei naw lei elin ieng- dingin am kan pa hming chu a thlahai laia chun bo el a ta? Kan pa unauhai lai chanvo mi pe ve ro,” an ta."

6,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
7,The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.,“Zelophehad naunuhai chu an indik a nih; an pa chanvo chu i pêk ding a nih.
8,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.","Chun, Israel thlahai kuomah chun, ‘Mi naupasal nei loa a thi chun a ro chu a naunuhmei in pêk ding a nih."

13,"And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered;","Chun, i hang hmu zo chun i unaupa Aron chu a chipuihai kuomah ṭhuoi a ni ang bawkin nang khawm ṭhuoi ni tâng i tih."
14,"because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)","Zin thlalêra pungkhâwmhai an chier laia an mithmuah tuia khan mi chawimawi dinga ka thupêk che kala i hel lei khan,” a ta.

16,"Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,","“LALPA, tisa po po thlarauhai Pathien chun pungkhâwmhai chunga chun hotu ruot sienla,"
17,"who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of Jehovah be not as sheep which have no shepherd.","LALPA mi pungkhâwmhai chu vêngtu nei lo berâm anga an um nawna dingin an hmaa suok le lût a, anni ṭhuoi suoka ṭhuoi lûttu dingin,” tiin."
18,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Nun naupa mi lungril neitak Josua chu ṭhuoi la, a chungah i kut innghat la,"
19,"and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.","thiempu Eleazar le pung- khâwmhai hmaa chun inngîrtir la, an mithmua chun thuneina pe rawh."
20,"And thou shalt put of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey.","Chun, Israel thla pungkhâwm- hai po poin a thu an âwi theina dingin a chungah i thuneina aṭhen inhlân rawh."

22,"And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:","Mosie chun LALPA thupêk ang chun a thawh a, Josua chu a ṭhuoi a, Eleazar le pungkhâwmhai po po hmaa chun ân ngîrtir a;"
23,"and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as Jehovah spake by Moses.","chun, a chungah kut ân nghat a, Mosie hmanga LALPAIN a hril ang khan thuneina a pêk tah a."
