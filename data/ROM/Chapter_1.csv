1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,","Paula, Isu Krista suok, tirko ni dinga ko, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha hril dinga ṭhethlâka um lekhathawn:"
2,"which he promised afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures,","Chu Chanchin Ṭha chu Pa- thienin inhmata a lekha inthieng- haia zâwlneihai baua a ilo tiem tah, a Naupa ei Lalpa Isu Krista thu chu a nih."
3,"concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,","Tisa tienga chun ama chu David suona insieng a na,"
4,"who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead; even Jesus Christ our Lord,",inthiengna Thlarau tieng thua ruok chun mithi laia inthawka a thonâwkna chun Pathien Nau a ni zie thilthawtheina nasatakin ân hriettir a;
5,"through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name’s sake;",A hming leia hnam tin laia mi ringna thu chu inzâwmtir dingin; ama zâra chun lunginsietna le tirko nina chu kan chang tah a;
6,"among whom are ye also, called to be Jesus Christ’s:",nangni khawm chuonghai lai chun Isu Krista ta ni dinga ko chu in nih.
7,"to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.","Rom khuoa Pathien idittakhai, mi inthieng ni dinga kohai po po kuomah; Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Kristaa inthawka lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se."
8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.","A hmasatakin, khawvêl po poah in ringna thu ân thang leiin in rênga chunga ka lâwm thu, Isu Krista zârah ka Pathien kuomah ka hril a nih."
9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers",A Naupa Chanchin Ṭha hrila ka thlaraua a rawng ka ibâwl Pathien chu a mi hrepuitu a nih; ka ṭawngṭainahaia chun maloin in hminghai ka lam rawp a.
10,"making request, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come unto you.","Tu bêk hin in kuoma ka hung theina dingin Pathien remti ang anga, hung inzinna remchâng ka nei tei tei theina dingin ka hni rawp hlak."
11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;",In detna dinga Thlarau tieng thilpêk iengamanih ka pêk theina ding cheuin hmu cheu kân hâwk hle a nih.
12,"that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.",Chu chu in ringna le keia ringnain ei inthlamuon tuo theina dingin ka tina a nih.
13,"And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.","Unauhai, Jentail danghai laia kân rimna ra ka hmu ta ang bawkin, nangni lai khawm a ra ka hmu theina dingin, in kuoma hung vawi tamtak ka tum tah ti in hriet naw ka nuom nawh; nisienlakhawm, kha hma po khan chu dangin ka um rawp a."
14,"I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.","Grik mihai le hnamchawmhai kuomah bat ka nei, mi var le mi invêthai kuoma khawm."
15,"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are in Rome.","Chuongchun, nangni Rom khuoa mihai kuoma khawm Chan- chin Ṭha ka theitâwpa hril dingin inzosa zinga um ka nih."
16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.","Chanchin Ṭha chu kân zâpui si nawh a, tûkhawm a awihai po ta dinga sandamna dinga Pathien thilthawtheina a ni sih a; a phutin Juda mi ta dingin, chun, Grik mihai ta ding khawmin a hung nih."
17,"For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.","Chutaka chun awi nâwkzuolna dingin, ringnain Pathien felzie chu a hung inlang a, “Ringna leia mifel chu hring a tih” tia ziek ang khan."
18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness;",Thutak fel nawtaka dangtuhai Pathien ngaisak nawna le fel nawna po po chunga chun vâna inthawkin Pathien lungsen a hung inlang a nih.
19,because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested it unto them.,"Pathienin ân hriettir ta leiin, Pathien chanchin hriet dinghai chu an lungrilah inhriettirin a um sih a."
20,"For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse:","Amaa mizie hmu thei lo hai, a chatuon thilthawtheina le a Pathien nizie chu, leihnuoi siem tîra inthawkin chiengtaka hmuin a um a, thilsiema chun ân lang a nih; chuleichun, suonlam ding hrim an nei nawh;"
21,"because that, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.","Pathien hre zing siin Pathien angin an chawimawi nawh a, lâwmthu khawm an hril bawk si nawh. Teplo mei mei an ngaituo lem tah a, an lungril invêt chu a hung inthim tah a."
22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,","Vara inngaiin invêt an lo ni tah a,"
23,"and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.","Pathien thi thei lo ropuina chu, mihriem thi thei dâm le vatehai dâm, sapheimanli le thilhringhai lim angah an inchangtir tah a."
24,"Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves:","Chuleichun, an taksa inzakum- taka insiem tuo dingin an lungril inhâwk anga pawrchêtaka um phalin Pathienin a nghatsan tah a."
25,"for that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.","Pathien thutak chu khêla inchangtirin, a siemtu biek nêkin a isiemhai chu bein an rawng an bâwl ta lem sih a. A siemtu chu kumkhuoa inpâk tlâk a nih! Amen."
26,For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature:,"Chuleichun, Pathienin inzak- umtaka hur phalin a nghatsan a; an nuhmeihai rau khawma an um dân insiengpui chu dân naw anga um dingin an insuk danglam sih a;"
27,"and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.","pasalhai khawm nuhmei le inhmang dân pângngai chu bânsana hurin, ân hnarin an inhnar tuoh a; pasal le pasal khawm ṭha nawtakin an inthawh a, an suol man hmu ding chu anni le annia chun an hmuh a."
28,"And even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;","Chun, Pathien hriet an nuom naw leiin, thil mawi naw tak tak thaw dinga a dit naw zâwng lungril nei phalin Pathienin a nghatsan tah a;"
29,"being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,","chuongchun, rîtlona tinrêng dâm, suolna tinrêng dâm, inhnarna tinrêng dâm, lungril ṭhat nawna tinrêng dâmin an hung sip tah a; îtsîkna dâm, tuolthatna dâm, inhalna dâm, inhlêmna dâm, lungril setak dâma sip an na; inberu hmanghai,"
30,"backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,","mi rêl hmanghai, Pathien theida zâwnghai, intiveihai, chapo- hai, mi uonghai, thil suol thar suksuoktuhai, nu le pa thu awi lohai,"
31,"without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful:","hrietthiemna bo, thu tiem bawsietuhai, piengpui lunginsietna nei naw mihai, lunginsietna nei naw mihai an lo ni tah a;"
32,"who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.","chuong ang thawtuhai chu thi tlâk an nih, ti Pathien iruot chu hre zing siin, anni chau khawma thaw loin, mi dang a thawhai chunga khawm chun an lâwm bawk a."
