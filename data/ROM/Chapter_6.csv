1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?",Ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Lunginsietna chu a pung nâwk zuolna dingin suolin ei um zing ding am a nih?
2,"God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?",Teu lo e a! Eini suol tienga thi ta hnunghai iengtin am suolin la hring zing thei ei ta?
3,Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?,"Eini laia Krista Isua baptisma changhai po chu, a thinaah baptisin ei um ti in hriet naw maw?"
4,"We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.","Chuleiin, a thinaa baptisma ei changin, a kuomah phûmin ei um veh a; Pa ropuinain mithi laia inthawka Krista a keitho ang khan, eini khawm hringna thara ei um theina dingin."
5,"For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection;","A thina inangpuia ama leh ei inzawm ta si chun, a thonâwkna in- angpuia khawm inzawm bawk ei tih."
6,"knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;","Hieng hi ei hriet; ei mihriem hlui chu a kuoma hemdein a um ve tah, suol taksa chu sukboa a um theina dinga, tuta chen chu suol suoka ei um ta nawna dingin."
7,for he that hath died is justified from sin.,Tûkhawm a thi ta chu suola inthawkin a suok ta sih a.
8,"But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;","Chun, Krista kuomah ei thi ve ta chun, a kuomah hring ve bawk ei tih, ti ei ring a nih;"
9,knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.,"Krista chu mithi laia inthawka keithoin a um a, a thi nâwk ta naw ding a nih, ti ei hriet sih a."
10,"For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.","Thina chun ama chungah thu a nei ta nawh. A thina chu suol tieng kawnga kumkhuoa dingin vawikhat chau a thi a na, a hringna ruok chu Pathien tieng kawnga hring a nih."
11,"Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.","Chuong ang bawkin, nangni khawm suol tieng kawngah thi taah inngai unla, Pathien tieng kawnga ruok chun Krista Isua chun hringah inngai ro."
12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:","Chuleiin, in taksa nuom zâwng ang in zâwmna dingin, in taksa thi theia chun suolnain ro rêl naw raw se."
13,"neither present your members unto sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.","In taksa pênghai khawm fel nawna hriemhrei dingin suolna kuomah pe phal bawk naw ro; nisienlakhawm, mithi laia inthawka hring nâwk angin Pathien kuomah inpe unla, in taksa pênghai khawm chu felna hriemhrei dingin Pathien kuomah pe phal lem ro."
14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.","Suolnain in chungah thu a nei ta naw ding a ni sih a, Dân rorêla um in ni nawh a, lunginsietna rorêla um in ni lem sih a."
15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.","Iengtin am nîng a ta? Dân rorêla um ei ni nawh a, lunginsietna rorêla um ei ni lem lei hin ei suol ding am a nih? Teu lo e a!"
16,"Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?","Tu kuoma khawm an thu awi dinga an suoka in lût chun, thina khawpa suol suok amanih, felna khawpa thuawina suok amani khawm ni sienla, a thu in iawi suok chu in nih ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
17,"But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;","Amiruokchu, Pathien kuomah lâwmthu um raw se! suol suok ni unla khawm inchûktir dân,a kuoma in inpêkna chu lungril tak zetin in lo awi a;"
18,"and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.","chun, suola inthawk chu insuoin in um a, felna suokhai in hung ni ta sih a."
19,"I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification.","(In taksa hrât nawna leiin mihriem dânin thu ka hril a nih). In taksa pênghai chu inthieng nawna kuoma le bawsietna dinga bawsietna kuomah suoka in pêk phal ang khan, tuhin in taksa pênghai chu inthiengna dingin felna kuomah suok dingin pe phal ro."
20,"For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.",Suolna suokhai in ni lai khan felna tieng chu in fihlim a nih.
21,What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.,Tuta in thil inzâpui tahaia hin khâng lai khan ra ieng am in lo hmu hlak leh? Khang thil tâwpna kha thina a nih in sawnnaw.
22,"But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.","Tu ruok hin chu suola inthawka sukfihlîma um a, Pathien suokhai in hung ni hin, inthiengna hmu khawpin ra in nei in sawnnaw; chu chu tâwpna kumkhuoa hringna leh."
23,For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.,Suol man chu thina a ni sih a; Pathien thilthlâwnpêk ruok chu ei Lalpa Krista Isu zârah chatuona hringna a nih.
