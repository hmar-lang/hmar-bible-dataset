1,"I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.","Anleh, Pathienin a mihai chu a pei thlâk am a nih? Teu lo e a! Kei khawm Israel mi, Abraham thla, Benjamin hnam ka ni sih a."
2,God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:,"Pathienin mi a ihriet lâwkhai chu a pei thlâk nawh. Pathien Lekha Thu chun Elija, thu a hril hi in hriet naw am a nih? Ama chun Israelhai chungthu Pathien kuomah ân tlun a;"
3,"Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.","“Lalpa, i zâwlneihai an sukhlum a, I mâichâmhai an cho chim a, Keia khât chauin ka la um a, Kei khawm mi sukhlum an tum a nih,” a ti hi."
4,"But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ieng- tin am a dawn a? “Baal hmaa la dingṭhaṭhuon ngai naw, mi sâng sari keia tâ dingin ka la hla zing a nih,” tiin a dawn a."
5,Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.,"Chuong ang bawkin, tulai khawm hin lunginsietnaa thlang ang peiin pei thlâk mahla chu an la um."
6,"But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.",Lunginsietna lei a ni chun thilthaw lei ni ta naw ni; chuong a ni naw chun lunginsietna hi lungin- sietna ni ta naw ni.
7,"What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:","Iengtin am ni tâng a ti leh? Israel mihai chun an zawng chu an hmu nawh a; Thlanghai ruok chun an hmuh a, a danghai po po chu an ngawng zo tah a."
8,"according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.","“Pathienin vawisûn chen hin inlusukna thlarau a pêk a, hmu thei nawna mithai le, hriet thei nawna nâhai dâm le chun,” tia ziek ang khan."
9,"And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:","Chun, David chun, “An dâwkân chu an ta dingin châng le bil le, Tlûkna le, thungna lo ni raw se;"
10,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back always.","An hmu thei nawna dingin an mithai hung inthim raw se; Nangin an ruongzâng inkûntir rawp rawh,” a tih a."
11,"I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.","Anleh, an tlûk chu an tlûk sawngna ding am a nih? Teu lo e a! An tlûk leiin Jentailhai kuoma chun sandamna a hung tlung ta lem a nih; Israel mihai inthîktirna dingin."
12,"Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?","Chuongchun, an tlûkna hman khawvêl sukhausakna a na, an kiemna hman Jentailhai sukhausak- na a ni chun, an famkimna chu an hausakna a va ni nasa zuol ding de!"
13,"But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;","Chuongchun, nangni Jentailhai kuomah ka hril a nih. Kei Jentailhai tirko ka ni leiin, ka rawngbâwlna sin hi ka chawimawi a nih;"
14,"if by any means I may provoke to jealousy them that are my flesh, and may save some of them.","ka chipuihai kân thîktir hrâm theina ding le, anni laia mi ṭhenkhat ka sandam theina dingin."
15,"For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?","Anni pei thlâkna hman khawvêl ta dinga inrem nâwkna a ni chun, anni lâwm nâwkna ding chu, thinaa inthawka hring nâwkna naw chu ieng am ning a ta?"
16,"And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.","Chun, bei tlang ât thlâk hmasa- tak chu inhlân thieng a ni chun a pumin chuong ang bawk chu a nih. A zung ân thieng chun a kâuhai khawm chuong ang bawk chu a nih."
17,"But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;","Chun, a kâu a ṭhen chu suk- tlieka umin, nang oliv puopa ni si, anni laia zawma umin, oliv thing hringna ṭha în ṭawmpui ve a ni chun,"
18,"glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.","a kâu danghai lai chun insuong naw rawh. Insuong la khawm, nang a zung châwmtu i ni nawh a, a zung chu nang a châwmtu che a ni lem a nih."
19,"Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.","Chun, nangin, “Zawma ka um theina dingin a kâuhai chu suktliekin a um annâwm?” tîng i tih."
20,"Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:","Anih, an ring nawna leiin suk- tliekin an um a, nang i ringna leiin i ngîr a nih."
21,"for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.","Chapo naw la, ṭi lem rawh. Pathienin a kâu takhai hman a hla si naw chun nang khawm hla bîk naw ni che."
22,"Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.","Chuongchun, Pathien ṭhatzie le a ṭiumzie chu ngaituo rawh; a tluhai ta ding chun ṭi a um a nih; nanga ta ding ruok chun a ṭha a nih, a ṭhatnaa i um zing chun; chuong a ni naw chun, nang khawm sât thlâkin um vêng i tih."
23,"And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.","Chun, anni khawm chu awi loa an um zing naw chun zawmin um an tih; Pathienin anni a zawm nâwk thei sih a."
24,"For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?","Nang oliv puopa hrima in- thawka sât thlâk hman, pieng dân naw anga oliv thing ṭhaa zawma i um chun, chuong a kâu tak takhai chu an bulpui, oliv thing pângngaia chun zawm an va ni nasa âwm de!"
25,"For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;","Unauhai, hi thurûk hi in hriet naw ka nuom nghâl si nawh a, chuong naw chun intivar in tih; Jentail famkimna a hung tlung hma chun Israel mi ṭhenkhat chungah ngawngna a hung tlung hri phawt a nih, ti hi."
26,"and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:","Chuongchun, Israel mi po po sandamin um an tih; “Ziona inthawkin Sandamtu chu hung suok a ta, Jakob kuoma Pathien ngaisak nawna sukbo a tih."
27,"And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins.","Chu chu an kuoma ka thu thlung ding chu a nih, An suolhai ka lâk hmang pha chun,” tia ziek ang khan."
28,"As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.","Chanchin Ṭha tieng ngaituo chun nangni leiin hmêlma an nih; Thlang thu tienga ngaituo ruok chun, thlatuhai lei khan dittakhai an nih."
29,For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.,Pathienin a thilthlâwnpêkhaia le a konaa chun a lungril a lêt ngai si nawh a.
30,"For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,","Inhma khan Pathien thu in awi nawh a, nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu an awi naw leiin lunginsietna in chang sih a;"
31,"even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.","Chuong ang bawkin tuhin chu Pathienin a lunginsiet cheu lei hin, lunginsietna chu an hmu ve theina dingin anni khawm chun an awi ve ta naw a ni hi."
32,"For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.",Pathienin a lunginsiet vawng theina dingin mi po po awi lonaah a khum ta vawng sih a.
33,"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!","Pathien hausakzie, a varna le hrietna hauzie chu a vân thûk de! A rorêlnahai chu hriet thei ruol le, a lampuihai chu sui thei ruol a va ni naw de!"
34,For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?,Lalpa lungril chu tuin am a hriet a? A remruotpêktua khawm tu am a ṭhang tah a?
35,"or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?",A thung nâwk dingin tuin am a kuomah thil pe hmasa?
36,"For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. Amen.","Amaa inthawk le ama zâr le, ama ta dinga thil po po a hung um a ni sih a; ama kuoma chun chatuonin ropuina chu um raw se. Amen."
