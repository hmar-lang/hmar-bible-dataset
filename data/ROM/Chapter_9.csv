1,"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,","Kristaa chun thu taktak ka hril a nih, khêl ka hril nawh, Thlarau Inthieng zâra chun,a ka sie le ṭha hrietna khawmin a mi hrietpui a,"
2,that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.,ka lungrila hin rinumna nasatak le lungngaina bo thei naw ka nei in sawnnaw.
3,"For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:","Ka unauhai, tisa tienga ka chipuihai aiin, kei hi Krista kuoma inthawka ṭhe thlâk khawp hiela thusie phurin um lang ka ti lem a nih,"
4,"who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;","Israel mi an ni sih a; nau nina dâm, ropuina dâm, thuthlung po po dâm, Dân pêkna dâm, Pathien rawngbâwlna dâm, thutiemhai po po an ta a nih;"
5,"whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.","thlatu bulhai chu an ta a ni bawk a, tisa tieng thuah Krista chu anni laia inthawka hung suok a ni sih a; ama chu thil tinrêng chunga um a na, chatuona inpâk tlâk Pathien a nih. Amen."
6,"But it is not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien thu chu iengkhawm ni lo anga um ta a ni nawh a. Israelhai chu Israel mi an ni vawng chuong nawh."
7,"neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.","Abraham thlahai an ni leiin an rêngin a nauhai an ni chuong bawk nawh; “Isaka hin i thlahai tîng an tih,” ti a ni lem."
8,"That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.","Chu chu, tisa nauhai chu Pathien nauhai an ni nawh a, thutiem nauhai chu Abraham thlaa ngai an nih tina a nih:"
9,"For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.","Thutiem chu hi hi a nih: “Tu phâ ang hin hung ka ta, Sara chun naupasal nei a tih,” ti hi."
10,"And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, even by our father Isaac—","Chu chau chu a ni nawh a, Rebeka khawma mi pakhat ei pa Isaka inthawka phîr a vawn lai khan,"
11,"for the children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,","naute chu an la suok hmaa, a sie le aṭha an la hriet hmain thil thaw lei ni loin,"
12,"it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.","a kotu dit lei ni lemin, thlang tieng thua Pathien thu ruot chu a det theina dingin, a kuoma chun, “A upa lemin a naupang lem rawng bâwl a tih,” Pathienin a ti kha."
13,"Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.","“Jakob chu ka hmangai a, Esau chu ka theida,” tia ziek ang khan."
14,What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.,Ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Pathiena chun fel nawna a um am a nih? Teu lo e a!
15,"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.","Ama chun, “Ka lunginsiethai po chu lunginsiet ka ta, zâ ka ngainahai po chunga chun za ngai ka tih,” tiin Mosie kuomah a hril si kha."
16,"So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.","Chuleiin, a dittu lei a ni nawh a, a hnawttu lei a ni bawk nawh, a lunginsiettu Pathien lei a ni lem a nih."
17,"For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.","Pathien Lekha Thuin Pharao kuomah, “Ahi lei ngawt hin ka tungding che a nih, nangmaa chun, ka thilthawtheina kân entir theina ding le khawvêl po poa ka hming ân thang theina dingin,” a ti sih a."
18,"So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.","Chuongchun, Pathienin a nuom po a lunginsiet a, a nuom po a suklulul hlak a nih."
19,"Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?",Nang chun ka kuomah “Ieng dinga a la dem rawp am a na? A dit zâwng tûin am a kal a?” i ti ding a ni âwm a.
20,"Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?","Nisienlakhawm, aw mihriem, Pathien sêl veitu chu tû ang am i ni lie?

22,"What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:","Lunginsenna bêl bohmang tlâkhai chunga chun, Pathienin a lunginsenna le a thilthawtheina inlangtir nuom sien khawm, a daw hrâm hrâm chun ieng am pawi a ta?"
23,"and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,","Lunginsietna bêl, ropui dinga a lo buotsai lâwkhai chunga chun a lunginsietna hau zie ân entir theina ding a ni phawt chun."
24,"even us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?","Chu lunginsietna bêlhai chu Judahai lai chau ni loin, Jentailhai laia inthawka kohai khawm ei nih."
25,"As he saith also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, that was not beloved.","Hosea lekhabua, “Ka mihai ni ngai lo chu, ‘Ka mihai’ tîng ka ta, Chun, ka ihmangai ngainawnu chu, ‘Hmangainu’ tîng ka tih."
26,"And it shall be, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, There shall they be called sons of the living God.","Chun, hieng hi hung nîng a ta, an kuoma, ‘Ka mihai in ni nawh,’ tia an umna hmun ngeia chun, Pathien hring nauhai inbûkin um an tih,” tia a hril ang ngei khan."
27,"And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:","Isai khawma Israelhai thu khêkpuiin, “Israel mihai chu tuisuorieta phaiphin zâtin tam hai sien khawm, a ihrem bâk chau chu sandamin um an tih."
28,"for the Lord will execute his word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.","Lalpa chun inrangtakin hnuoi chunga a rorêlna chu a hlen ding a ni sih a,” a ti kha."
29,"And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.","Isai bawkin, “Mipuihai Lalpa chun chithlâtu mi lo hlapêk naw sien chu, Sodom angin lo um tâng ei ta, Gomorra anga siemin lo um tâng ei tih,” tia a lo hrillâwk ta ang khan."
30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:","Ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Jentail, felna hnawt nawhai chun felna an lo phâk tah a nih — ringna leia felna chu."
31,"but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.","Israel, felna dân hnawttuhai ruok chun felna dân chu an phâk zo ta nawh."
32,"Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;","Ieng lei am a na? Ringna leh an hnawt nawh a, thilthawa an hnawt lei a nih. Tlûkna lunga chun an tlu ta sih a;"
33,"even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.","“Ngai ta, Ziona chun Tlûkna lung le, Dangna lungpui ka sie a; Tûkhawm ama ring taphawt chu Muolpho naw ni,” tia ziek ang khan."
