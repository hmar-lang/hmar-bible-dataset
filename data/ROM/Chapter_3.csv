1,What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?,Anleh Juda mi chun sâwtna ieng am a nei chuong bîk a? Sertan khawm chu a sâwtna ieng am a ni leh?
2,"Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.",Kawng tinrêngah a sâwt hle. Pathien thuhai an kuomah inkawl- tira a um lei a ni tak.
3,For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?,Anni laia ṭhenkhathai ringum nawhai sien khawm ieng am a ni chuong leh? An ringumnawna chun Pathien ringumzie chu ieng khawm niloin a siem chuong am a nih?
4,"God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.","Teu lo e! Pathien chu mi indiktak lo ni raw se, mi tin chu mi khêlhlip lo nihai sien khawm: “Nangin i thu hrilin thiem în changtir thei a, rorêlpêka i um khawma i hne theina dingin,” ti ziek ang khan."
5,"But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)","Nisienlakhawm, ei fel nawnahai hin Pathien felna chu a suklang mawi zuol si chun ieng am hril ei ta? Pathienin mi a hrem hin, mi fel lo a ni am a nih? (Mihriem dân takin hril ta inla)."
6,God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?,Teu lo e! Chuong a ni chun Pathienin iengtin am khawvêl ro rêl a ta?
7,"But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?","Nisienlakhawm, ka khêl hril leia Pathien thu indikzie ama sukropui khawp raua ân lang nâwk pei chun, ieng dinga kei khawm mi suol anga thiemnaw inchangtira la um rawp am ka na?"
8,"and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.","Mîn an mi hêk a, mi ṭhenkhatin ka hril naw tawp an mîn hriltir angin ieng dinga, “Thil ṭha a hung theina dingin thil suol thâwng ei tiu,” tiin ei hril lem naw? Chuong ang mihai chun thiemnaw an chang chu a fel a nih."
9,"What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;","Annawleh, eini Judahai hi anni nêkin ei ṭha chuong bîk am a nih? Teu lo e! Judahai le Grikhai chu angkhat rawnga suolna suoka um vawng ei nih ti hi hma khawmin ei hril ta kha;"
10,"as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;","“Tukhawm mi fel hrim an um nawh. Pakhat bêk khawm an um nawh,"
11,"There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;","Tûkhawm a hre thiem hrim an um nawh, Tûkhawm Pathien zawng hrim an um nawh."
12,"They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one:","A ni naw tieng an pêt vawng tah a, Ienga khawm hmang tlâk loin an um vawng tah a; Tûkhawm thil ṭha thaw hrim an um nawh; Pakhat bêk khawm an um nawh."
13,Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:,"An hnuk chu thlân inhawng a na, An leiin inhlêmna thu a hril a, An bau sûngah rûl tûr a um a,"
14,Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:,An bau chu ṭawngseinphurna le thu khain a sip a.
15,Their feet are swift to shed blood;,An ke chu thisen insuo dingin a pên hrât a;
16,Destruction and misery are in their ways;,An lampuia chun bohmangna le rinumna a um a.
17,And the way of peace have they not known:,Lungmuongna lampui khawm an hriet nawh.
18,There is no fear of God before their eyes.,"An mithmuah Pathien ṭina hrim a um nawh,” ti ziek ang khan."
19,"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:","Dânin iengkhawm a hril taphawt chu Dân thu thua umhai kuomah a hril a nih ti ei hriet a, bau tinrêng hupa a um theina ding le, khawvêla mi po po Pathien rorêla an um theina dingin."
20,because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin.,"Chuongchun, mi tukhawm Dâna thilthaw leiin a mithmuah thiem changin um naw ni hai; Dân leiin suol hriet famkimna a hung um a ni sih a."
21,"But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin Dân ṭhang loa Pathien felna chu suk- langin a um tah; Dân le zâwlneihai thu khawma a hril kha a nih;"
22,even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;,"chu chu Pathien felna, Isu Krista ringna leia ama awitu taphawt kuoma suklanga um chu a nih; a danglamna hrim a um nawh a."
23,"for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;","Mi po poin thil an suksuol vawng tah a, Pathien ropuina an chang zo ta naw a nih."
24,being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:,"Chuong a ringtuhai chu Krista Isua intlanna um lei chun, lungin- sietnaa a thlâwna thiem inchangtirin an um a."
25,"whom God set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;",Pathienin ama felzie inentir dingin Krista Isu chu a thisen ringnaa suol thuphachawina dingin a ruot a. Pathien zaidawtheinain in- hmaa suolnahai chu hriet naw tehlêm a thaw a nih.
26,"for the showing, I say, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.",Ama ngei chu mi fel a nizie le Isua ringna nei taphawt thiem inchangtirtu a ni zie tulaia inentirna dingin a nih.
27,Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.,"Insuongna chu khâwlai am a um leh? A puo tienga khâr nelin a um tah. Ieng dânin am a na? Thilthaw dânin am a nih? Ni lo e, Ringna dânin a ni lem."
28,We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.,"Chuongchun, Dân thil thaw lei ni loin, ringna leiin miin thiem chang dingin ei ngai a nih."
29,"Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:",Pathien chu Judahai Pathien chau am a nih? Jentailhai Pathien khaw m a ni ve naw am a nih? Ni veh e.
30,"if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.","Sertanhai chu an ring leia thiem inchangtirtu ding le, sertan- nawhai chu an ring leia thiem inchangtirtu Pathien pakhat chau a ni si chun, Jentailhai Pathien khawm ni ve ngei naw ni."
31,"Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.","Anleh, ringna lei ngawtin Dân chu iengkhawm ni loin ei siem el am a nih? Teu lo e! Dân chu ei sukdet lem hman a nih."
