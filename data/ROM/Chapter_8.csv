verse_no,en,hmr
1,There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.,"Chuongchun, tuhin chu Krista Isua umhai ta ding chun thiem- naw inchangtirna hrim a um ta nawh."
2,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.,Krista Isua Hringna Thlarau dân chun suolna le thina dâna inthawk chun a mi sansuok ta sih a.
3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:","Tisa leiin Dân chu a hrât nawh a, a thaw thei ruol naw chu Pathienin ama Naupa ngei tisa suol ang putin suol thawina dinga hung tirin, tisaa suolna um chu thiemnaw ân changtir tah a nih,"
4,"that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.","tisa dân hraw lo a, Thlarau dân hraw lemtu einia hin Dân thu ruot chu hlena a um theina dingin."
5,For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.,Tisa dâna umhai chun tisa tieng thilhai an dit hlak; Thlarau dâna umhai ruok chun thlarau tieng thilhai an dit hlak. Tisa tieng thil dit chu thina a ni sih a;
6,For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:,Thlarau tieng thil dit ruok chu hringna le lungmuongna a nih;
7,"because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:","tisa dit zâwng chu Pathien dona a ni sih a. Chu chu Pathien dânin a um nghâl si nawh a, um khawm a um thei bawk nawh."
8,and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.,"Chuleiin, tisaa umhai chun Pathien an suklâwm thei nawh."
9,"But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.","Chuongchun, Pathien Thlarau chu nangniah a chêng takzet a ni chun, tisaa um ni loin, Thlaraua um in ni lem. Tukhawm Krista Thlarau nei naw chu ama mi a ni nawh."
10,"And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.","Krista chu nangniah a um ruok chun, in taksa chu suolna leia thi khawm ni sien, Pathiena thiem changa um in ni leiin in thlarau chu a hring a nih."
11,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.","Nisienlakhawm, mithi laia inthawka Isu keitho nâwktu Thlarau kha nangniah a um chun, mithi laia inthawka Krista Isu keitho nâwktu khan nangnia um Thlarau zâra chun, in taksa thi theihai chu sukhring bawk a tih."
12,"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:","Chuleichun, unauhai, bat ei nei, tisa dâna um lo dingin, tisa kuoma khawm ni bawk loin."
13,"for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.","Tisa dâna in um chun in thi ngei ding a nih; amiruokchu, taksa thil- thawhai chu Thlaraua in sukhlum hlak chun hring in tih."
14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.",Pathien Thlarau ṭhuoia umhai po chu Pathien nauhai an ni sih a.
15,"For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.","Ṭia um nâwk dingin suok nina thlarau in hmu a ni si nawh a; nau nina thlarau in hmu lem a nih; chu thlarau zâra chun, “Abba! (Pa)” tiin ei khêk hlak hi."
16,"The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:","Thlarau ngei chun, eini thlarau leh, Pathien nauhai ei nih ti a mîn hriettir hlak."
17,"and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.","Chun, nauhai ei ni chun ro- hluotuhai, Pathien rohluotu, Krista hluopuituhai ei nih; chuleiin, ama ei tuorpui ding a nih, a kuoma chawimawia ei um ve theina dingin."
18,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.,Tulaia tuornahai hi ei chunga ropuina suklanga la um ding le chun hrilkhi khawpa ka ngai si nawh a.
19,For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.,Thilsiemhai chun beiseitakin Pathien nauhai hung inlangna chu an nghâkhla hle sih a.
20,"For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope","Thilsiem po pohai chu, thil teplo thu thua inumtirin an um tah; an nuoma um an ni nawh a, ân umtirtu lei a ni lem a nih."
21,that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.,"Beiseina neiin thilsiemhai po po khawm chu sietna suoka inthawka insuoin um an ta, Pathien nauhai zalênna ropuia chun an lût ding a ni sih a."
22,For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.,Thilsiem po pohai chu tu chen hin inrûm le nauhasena tuorin an um tâwl ti ei hriet sih a.
23,"And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.","Chu chau khawm chu ni loin, eini, Thlarau rahmasa neituhai ngei khawm hin, nau ei nina (ei taksa intlanna) chu nghâkin, eini meu khawm ei lungrilin ei inrûm sih a."
24,For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?,"Beiseinain a nih, sandama ei um chu; nisienlakhawm, hmu thei zing beiseina hi beiseina a ni nawh a, miin a hmu thei zing chu iengtin am a la beisei hlak a?"
25,"But if we hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.",Ei hmu naw chu ei beisei chun ei nghâk fan fan hlak a nih.
26,And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered;,"Chuong ang bawkin, Thlarau chun ei hrât nawnahaiah a mi ṭhang- pui hlak a; ieng anga ṭawngṭai ding am a ni ti ei hriet si nawh a; nisienlakhawm, Thlarau chun inrûm hril ruol loin a mi ṭawngṭai pêk hlak."
27,"and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.","Chun, Pathien dit zâwng ang peiin mi inthienghai chu a ṭawngṭai pêk hlak leiin, lungrilhai entu chun Thlarau dit zâwng chu a hriet hlak a nih."
28,"And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, even to them that are called according to his purpose.","Chun, Pathien hmangaituhai amain a ruot anga a kohai ta ding chun, an ṭhatna dingin iengkimin a thawpêk hlak ti ei hriet a."
29,"For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:","A hrietlâwkhai chu ama Naupa ang taka um dingin a ruot lâwk sih a, a Naupa chu unau tamtak laia nau lutîr a hung ni theina dingin."
30,"and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.","Chun, a ruot lâwkhai chu a ko bawk a; a kohai chu thiem ân changtir bawk a; chun, thiem ân changtir hai chu a châwimâwi bawk a."
31,"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?",Chuong thua chun ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Pathien eini tieng a ṭhang chun tuin am mi do thei a ta?
32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?","Ama naupa ngei khawm hla loa, ei rênga aia petu chun, thil dang po po khawm a thlâwnin a mi pêk sa naw ding am a nih?"
33,Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth;,Pathien mi thlanghai chu tuin am hêk a ta? Thiem inchangtirtu kha Pathien a ni sih a.
34,"who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.","Tuin am thiemnaw inchangtir a ti leh? A thi chu Isu Krista chu a ni sih a, anih, mithi laia inthawka tho nâwk ta lem a, Pathien changtienga uma a mi hrilpêktu bawk kha a nih."
35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?","Krista hmangainaa inthawk chu tuin am mi ṭhêng a ta? Rinum- nain amanih, lungngainain amanih, suknawmnatnain amanih, ṭâmin amanih, saruoknain amanih ṭiumin amanih, kâwlhnâmin amanih a mi ṭhe ding am a nih?"
36,"Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.","“Nangma leiin sûnnithlâkin thatin kan um hlak; Berâm that ding anga ngai kan nih,” tia ziek ang khan."
37,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.","Ṭhe lo e! chuong po poa chun, a mi hmangaitu lei chun ropuitaka hnetu ei nih."
38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,","Chiengtakin ka hriet a nih; thina dâm, hringna dâm, vântirko dâm, inlalna dâm, thil umsa le a la um ding dâm,"
39,"nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.","thilthawtheina dâm, insângna dâm, inthûkna dâm, thilsiem dang hrim hrim khawmin ei Lalpa Krista Isua um Pathien hmangainaa inthawk chun mi ṭhe naw ni."
