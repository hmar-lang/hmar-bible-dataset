verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;","Chuleiin, ringna leia thiem changa umin, ei Lalpa Isu Krista leiin Pathien le inremin ei um a;"
2,through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.,"ama lei bawk chun hi lungin- sietnaa ei ngir detnaa hin ringnain ei lût tah a, Pathien ropuina beiseiin lâwmin ei um bawk a nih."
3,"And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness;","Chu chau chu ni loin, ei rimsiknaa khawm lâwmin ei um a nih, rimsikna chun selna a siem a,"
4,"and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope:","tuorselna chun hriet fiena a siem a, hriet fiena chun beiseina a siem ti ei hriet sih a."
5,and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us.,"Chun, Thlarau Inthieng ei kuoma a mi pêk khan Pathien hma- ngaina chu ei lungrilah a hung buok ta leiin beiseina chun a mi sukbeidawng nawh a."
6,"For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.",Ei la hrât naw lai khan a hun takah Krista chu mi suolhai ai chun a lo thi ta sih a.
7,For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.,"Mi fel aia thi miin a nuom naw âwm hle sih a, mi ṭha ai ruok chun mi tûamani bêk chun thi a lo ngam khiet rawi mawh."
8,"But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chun a mi hmangaina chu inpâk tlâkin ân langtir a, mi suolhai ei la ni laia Krista eini aia a thinaa khan."
9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him.","Chuongchun, a thisena thiem inchangtira ei um ta hin chu, ama lei bawkin Pathien lungsennaa in- thawkin sandamin um ngei ei tih."
10,"For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;","Hmêlma ei ni lai hmana, a Naupa thina leia Pathien le lo inrem tah ei ni chun, inrema ei um ta hnung lem hin chu a hringna leiin sandamin um ngei ei tih."
11,"and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.","Chuong chau khawm chu a ni nawh a, inremna tuta a mîn hmutirtu ei Lalpa Isu Krista lei chun Pathienah ei lâwm bawk a nih."
12,"Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:—","Chuongchun, mi pakhat leiin suol khawvêla hin a lût a, suol leiin thina a lût bawk a; chuong ang bawkin mi po poin thil an lo suksuol ta leiin thinain mi po po a fang suok tah a."
13,for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.,Dân um hmain suol khawvêlah a um ta sih a; dân a um si naw chun suol chu suola ngai a ni nawh.
14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.","Nisienlakhawm, Adama in- thawk Mosie um chenin Adam bawsietna anga thil suksuol nawhai chunga khawm thina chun ro a rêl hlak a. Adam chu la hung dingpa hlimthla chu a nih."
15,"But not as the trespass, so also is the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many.","Nisienlakhawm, thilthlâwnpêk chu bawsietna leh ân ang nawh. Mi pakhat bawsietna lei hman khan mi tamtak chu an thi si chun, Pathien lunginsietna le mi pakhat Isu Krista lunginsietna leia thilpêk chu, mi tamtak chungah vurin um ngei a tih."
16,"And not as through one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment came of one unto condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses unto justification.","Chun, chu thilpêk chu mi pakhat suol leia thil hung um le chun ân ang bawk nawh; thiemnaw inchangtirna rorêlna chu mi pakhat leiin a hung um a, thiem inchang- tirna thilthlâwnpêk ruok chu bawsietna tamtak leiin a hung um ta lem a nih."
17,"For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, even Jesus Christ.","Mi pakhat bawsietna leiin, mi pakhat lei hmana thinain ro a rêl si chun, lunginsietna nasatak le felna thilpêk lo changtuhai khan mi pakhat Isu Krista lei khan hringnaa chun ro rêl ngei an tih."
18,So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness the free gift came unto all men to justification of life.,"Chuongchun, mi pakhat baw- sietna leiin, thiemnaw inchangtirna rorêlna chu mi po po chungah a hung um a; chuong ang bawkin thil fel pakhat thaw lei chun, hringna hmu- na dinga thiem inchangtirna thil- thlâwnpêk chu mi po po chungah a hung um."
19,"For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.",Mi pakhat thu awi nawna lei khan mi tamtak chu mi suol an hung ni tah; chuong ang bawkin mi pakhat thuawi lei khan mi tamtak chu mi fel hung nîng an tih.
20,"And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly:","Chun, bawsietna chu ân lang nawk zuol theina dingin Dân a hung um nâwk nghâl a. Nisienlakhawm, suol a pungna poah lunginsietna chu a pung zuol pei hlak;"
21,"that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.","suol chun thinain ro a rêl ang takin, lunginsietna chun, felnain kumkhaw hringna changna khawp hielin ei Lalpa Isu Krista zârah ro a rêl theina dingin."
