1,Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God.,Mi tin an chunga rorêltuhai thu thuin um raw se. Pathien thu loin tukhawm rorêltu an um ngai si nawh a; rorêltua umhai hi Pathien iruot an nih.
2,"Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.","Chuleiin, tûkhawm rorêltu kal chu Pathien iruot kal a nih; a kaltuhai chun anni chungah rorêlna hmûng an tih."
3,"For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same:","Rorêltuhai chu thil ṭha thaw- tuhai ta ding chun ṭium an ni nawh a, thil ṭha naw thawtuhai ta ding ruok chun ṭium an nih. Anleh, rorêltu ṭi loa um i nuom am? Thil ṭha thâw la, a înpâk hlâwng i tih;"
4,"for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.","ama chu i ṭhatna dinga Pathien rawngbâwltu a ni sih a. Nisien- lakhawm, thil suol i thaw chun ṭi rawh, kâwlhnâm chu a chawi mei mei si nawh a; ama chu Pathien rawng- bâwltu, thil suksuoltuhai chunga lunginsenna phuba latu a ni sih a."
5,"Wherefore ye must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.","Chuleiin, lunginsenna ṭi lei chau ni loin, i sie le ṭha hrietna lei khawmin rorêltu thu thuin i um ding a ni hrim a nih."
6,"For for this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God’s service, attending continually upon this very thing.",Hi lei hin annâwm sie khawm in chawi hlak; chuong ang thil ngei thaw fan fan dinga Pathien rawng- bâwltuhai an ni sih a.
7,Render to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.,"Mi po po kuomah pêk ding taphawt chu pe ro; leiman pêkna ding kuoma chun leiman pe unla, sie chawina ding kuoma chun sie chawi unla, ṭi ding chu ṭi unla, inza ding chu inza ro."
8,"Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.",Inhmangai tuona ngawt naw chu tû iengkhawm bat naw ro; mâni mihriempui hmangaitu chun dân chu a zâwm famkim ta sih a.
9,"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.","Hieng, “Uire naw, tuol that naw, inru naw, inhnar naw,” ti le thupêk danghai hrim hrim hi, “Nangma în hmangai angin i vênghai i hmangai ding a nih,” ti hin a khai khâwm vawng a nih."
10,Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: love therefore is the fulfilment of the law.,"Hmangainain vênghai a suk- khawhlo ngai nawh a, chuleiin hmangaina hi dân hraw famkimna a nih."
11,"And this, knowing the season, that already it is time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we first believed.","Tulai thil umzie in hriet lei le, inhai ta dingin innaa inthawkin ṭhanghar a hun ta takzet ti in hriet leiin chu chu ka hril a nih; tuhin chu ei awi phut lai nêk khan chu ei sandamna chu a hnai lem ta sih a."
12,"The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.","Zân hi a bo vâng vâng tah a, khuo a var ding a ni tah, chuleiin inthimna thilthawhai chu pei inla, var thuomin inthuom ei tiu khai."
13,"Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy.","Sûna um angin mawitakin um ei tiu, zu dâwn buoi le zu inruia um loin, hur le indit hmanga um loin, insuol le inîtthîka um loin,"
14,"But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.","Lalpa Isu Krista chun inthuom lem unla, in tisa inhâwkna puitlin dingin iengkhawm insiem naw ro."
