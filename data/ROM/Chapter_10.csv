verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.","Unauhai, ka lung nuom zâwng le, anni ta dinga Pathien kuoma ka ṭawngṭaina san tak hi, sandam an hung ni theina ding a nih."
2,"For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.","Pathien tieng ṭhahnem an ngai ti ka hrietpui a nih, hrietna indiktak leia ṭhahnemngaina ruok chu a ni nawh."
3,"For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.","Pathien felna hre loin, anni felna sukdet an tum a, Pathien felnaah an inpêk lût si nawh."
4,For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.,Krista chu ama ringhai po ta dingin felna an hmu theina dinga Dân suktâwpna a ni sih a.
5,For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.,"Mosie chun, “Mi Dâna felna zâwm chu, chu felna zâra chun hring a tih,” tiin a ziek a."
6,"But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)","Ringnaa felna ruok chun, hieng hin a hril, “In lungrilin, ‘Tu am vânah lâwn a ta?’ (chu chu Krista hung ṭhuoi thla ding tina a nih)"
7,"or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)","amanih, ‘Tu am vânsamah zu ṭum a ta?’ (chu chu mithi laia inthawka Krista zu ṭhuoi suok ding tina a nih) ti naw ro,” tiin."
8,"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:","Anleh, ieng am a hril a? “Thu chun a hnai che, i bau le i lungrila khawm a um,” tiin a hril a nih. Chu chu ringna thu ei hril hlak hi a nih:"
9,"because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved:","I bauin, “Isu chu Lalpa a nih” tia i ṭan a, mithi laia inthawkin Pathienin a keitho ti i lungrila i ring phawt chun sandamin um i tih."
10,for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.,"Mihaiin an lungrilin an ring a, felna an hmu hlak, bauin an ṭan a, sandamna an hmu bawk hlak a nih."
11,"For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.","Pathien Lekha Thuin, “Tû- khawm ama ring taphawt chu muolpho naw ni hai,” a ti a nih."
12,"For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him:",Juda le Grik mihai chu ienga khawm an danglam chuong si nawh a. Lalpa pakhat an rênga chunga Lalpa a nih; ama lamtuhai po chunga chun ṭhatna a hau sih a.
13,"for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.","“Tukhawm Lalpa hming lam taphawt chu sandamin um an tih,” a ti a nih."
14,How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?,"Anleh, an awi naw chu iengtin am lam an ta? A thu an hriet naw chu iengtin am awi an ta? Thuhriltu um loin iengtin am hrieng an ta?"
15,"and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!",Tir an ni naw chun iengtin am thu hril an ta? “Thil ṭha chanchin lâwmum intluntuhai ke chu a va mawi de!” tia ziek ang khan.
16,"But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?","Nisienlakhawm, Chanchin Ṭha chu an rêng chun an ring vawng nawh. Isaiin, “Lalpa, kan thu hril tuin am a ring a?” a ti sih a."
17,"So belief cometh of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.","Chuongchun, ringna chu hrietna leiin a hung um hlaka; chun, hrietna chu Isu Krista leiin a hung um."
18,"But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily, Their sound went out into all the earth, And their words unto the ends of the world.","Anleh, an nain an hriet naw am a nih? Hreh e le! “An ri chu ram tinah ân thang a, An thu chu kâwlkawdawng chenin ân thang suok tah.”"
19,"But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.","Anleh, Israel mihaiin an hriet naw am a nih? “Chia hril khawp lohai chu hmangin, Inthîktir ka ti cheu a, Hnam invêthai chu hmangin, Suklungsen ka ti cheu,” tiin Mosiein a hril hmasatak a."
20,"And Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.","Chun, Isaiin huoitakin, “A mi zawng nawhai hmuin ka um a, A mi lam nawhai kuomah inhriettirin ka um a,” a tih a."
21,"But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.","Amiruokchu, Israelhai thua chun, “Mi timawhai le sêlhrâthai ta dingin, Sûnnithlâkin ka bânhai ka phar hlak kha,” a tih a."
