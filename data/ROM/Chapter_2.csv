verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.","Chuleiin, aw mihriem, mi sawi- sêltu tûkhawm ni la, suonlam hrim i nei nawh, mi dang i sâwisêlna ngeia chun nang le nang thiemnaw inchangtir i nih i sawnnaw! nang a sawisêltu ngei khawma, chuong ang thil chu i thaw ve hlak sih a."
2,And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.,Chuong thil thaw hlaktuhai chunga Pathienin a sawisêlna chu thu indiktak a nih ti ei hriet sih a.
3,"And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?","Aw mihriem, chuong ang thil thaw hlaktuhai sawisêltu, nangin chuong ang chu i thaw ve bawk sih a, Pathienin a sawisêlna chu pumpel în ring am a ni?"
4,"Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?","Annawleh, Pathien ṭhatnain simna dingin a ṭhuoi hlak che ti hre loin, a ṭhatna hauzie le, a en theizie le, a zaidaw theizie dâm chu i ngainêp am a nih?"
5,but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;,"I lulul le i lungril ngar leiin, lungsenna le Pathien rorêlna feltak hung inlang ding nia ding chun i chungah lungsenna în khâwlkhâwm a ni lem a nih."
6,who will render to every man according to his works:,"Pathien chun mi tin an sinthaw ang peiin rêlpêk a tih,"
7,"to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:","thil ṭha thaw fan fana, ropuina le chawimawina le bohmang thei nawna zawngtuhai kuoma chun kumkhuoa hringna pêng a tih."
8,"but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be wrath and indignation,","Amiruokchu, kâwmaw suoh a, thutak zâwm loa fel nawna zâwm lemtuhai chunga chun Pathien lung senna le lungawinawna um a tih."
9,"tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;","Rinumna le lungngaina nasatak, mihriem thil suksuol pohai thlarau chungah um a ta, Juda mi thlarau chungah um hmasâng a ta, chun, Grik mi thlarau chungah um nâwk a tih."
10,"but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:","Amiruokchu, thil ṭhataka thaw- tuhai po po kuoma chun ropuina dâm, chawimawina dâm, lung- muongna dâm pêk nîng a tih; Juda mihai kuomah pêk hmasak nîng a ta, chun, Grik mihai kuomah ni nâwk a tih."
11,for there is no respect of persons with God.,Pathienin mi ditsak bîk a nei si nawh a.
12,For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;,"Tûkhawm Dân nei loa thil suksuol chu Dân boin bohmang a ta; chun, tûkhawm Dân nei zinga suksuol chu, Dâna rêlpêkin um a tih."
13,"for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified;","Dân hretu ringawthai chu Pathien mithmuin mi fel an ni nawh a, Dân anga thawtuhai chu mi fela tiemin um lem an tih."
14,"(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves;","Dân nei naw Jentailhai hmanin an lungril insiengpuia dân thilhai kha an thawin, Dân nei naw hai sien khawm anni le anni chu dânah an insiem fâwm a,"
15,"in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them);","an lungrilah dân sinthaw chu ziek a nih ti an inentir a; chu chu an sie le ṭha hrietnain an hrietpui a, an lungrilhai chu ân sêl a, akâr leh thiem ân changtir vak a, akâr leh thiemnaw ân changtir vak a."
16,"in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.",Pathienin ka Chanchin Ṭha hril anga mihriemhai thurûk Isu Krista hmanga a ngaituo ni chun chuong ang chu nîng a tih.
17,"But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,","Nisienlakhawm, nang Juda hming put i ni sih a, Dân chu i ringsan a, Pathien i suong a,"
18,"and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,","a dit zâwng i hriet a, Dân thu inchûktirin i um leiin thil ṭhatak chu ṭha i tih a,"
19,"and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,","nang ngei chu mitdelhai ṭhuoitu, inthima umhai êntu;"
20,"a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;","invêthai sukvartu le nautêhai inchûktirtu niin în ring a, Dâna chun varna le thutak um dân i nei leiin."
21,"thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?","Chuong ang i ni si chun, nang mi danghai inchûktirtu, nang le nang în chûktir naw am a nih?"
22,"thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?","Nang inru lo dinga mi dang hriltu, nangin în rûk hlak maw? Nang uire lo dinga mi dang hriltu, nang i uire maw? Nang milim theidatu, nangin milim biekna ina thilhai chu în rûk hlak maw?"
23,"thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God?","Nang Dân suongtu, nangin Dân i bawsiet leiin Pathien chu i suk- hmingse hlak a ni maw?"
24,"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.","An ziek ang ngei khan, Pathien hming chu nangni leiin Jentailhai laiah sukpâwiin a um ta a ni hi."
25,"For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.",Dân zâwmtu i ni chun sertan chu a sâwt tak zet a nih; Dân bawsetu i ni ruok chun i sertan chu tan naw ang el a lo ni tah.
26,"If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?","Chuleiin, sertan naw mîn Dân thu ruothai chu a vawng chun, a sertan naw chu tan anga ngai a ni naw ding am a nih?"
27,"and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?","Chun, mani insieng ziea sertan loin Dân chu a zâwm kim chun, nang, lekha thu le sertan dân nei sia Dân bawsetu chu a sawisêl naw ding che maw?"
28,For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:,Ân lang ela Juda mi ni chu Juda mi tak a ni nawh a; ân langa taksa mei meia sertan chu sertan tak tak a ni chuong naw bawk.
29,"but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.","Amiruokchu, ân lang el ni loa Juda mi ni chu Juda tak a nih; chun, sertan tak chu lungril tienga tan a nih, Lekha thu ela ni loin, Thlarauah a nih; ama chun mihriem inpâk a hlaw nawh a, Pathien inpâk a hlaw lem hlak."
