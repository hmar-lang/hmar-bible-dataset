verse_no,en,hmr
1,"What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, hath found according to the flesh?","Anleh, Abraham, tisa dâna ei thlatu chun a hmu ieng am hril ei ta?"
2,"For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God.","Abrahamin a thilthaw leiin thiem a chang si chun, suong ding a nei a nih; Pathien tieng ruok chun a nei nawh a;"
3,"For what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.","Pathien Lekhain ieng am a hril a? “Abraham chun Pathien a ring a, chu ringna chu a felnaa ngai a nih,” tiin a hril a nih."
4,"Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.","Chun, sinthawtu hlaw chu lunginsietnaa ngai a ni nawh a, bat anga ngai a ni lem a nih."
5,"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.","Amiruokchu, mi, a thilthawa innghat loa, Pathien hre nawhai thiem inchangtirtu ring lemtu ringna chu, a felnaa ngai a nih."
6,"Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works,","Mi, a thilthaw ngaituo loa, Pathienin fela a ingaihai hamṭhatzie chu David khawmin:-"
7,"saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, And whose sins are covered.","“An bawsietnahai ngaidama umhai le, An suolhai inkhuma um chu An hamṭha."
8,Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin.,"Lalpain suol neia a ingai naw chu an hamṭha,” tia a hril ang khan."
9,"Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness.","Anleh, chu hamṭhatna chu sertanhai chung chau âm a ni a um, sertan nawhai chunga khawm? “Abraham ringna chu a felnaa ruot a nih” ei ti sih a."
10,"How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:","Chu chu iengti ziea ngai am ni tâng a ta? A sertan hmain am a ni, a sertan hnungin? A sertan hnungin a ni nawh a, a sertan hmain a ni lem a nih."
11,"and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them;","Chuongchun, sertan loa a um laia, ringnain felna chu a hmu ti inhrietna, sertan inchikna chu a hmuh a, chu felna chu an ta dinga ruot a nina dingin sertan lohai laia ringtuhai po po pa a ni theina dingin,"
12,"and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.","sertanhai pa khawm a ni thei bawkna dingin– sertanhai pa chau a ni nawh a, ama, ei pa Abraham sertan loa a um laia, ringna a nei anga nei fâwmhai pa a ni lem a nih."
13,"For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.","Dân leiin Abraham le a thlahai kuoma chun khawvêl ro hluo ding thu chu tiem a ni nawh a, ringnaa felna lei a ni lem."
14,"For if they that are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect:","Dâna mihai rohluotuhai an ni si chun, ringna ienga khawm hmang a ni ta nawh a, thutiem khawm chu iengkhawm a ni ta nawh;"
15,"for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.",Dân chun lunginsenna a siem hlak sih a; Dân um nawnaa chun bawsietna khawm a um bawk nawh.
16,"For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all","Chuleiin, lunginsietna a ni theina dingin, ringna leiin a nih hi suon po pohai chun thutiem chu matheiloa an hmu chu. Dân nei mi chauin an hmu ding a ni nawh a, Abraham ringna ang ringna neihai khawmin hmûng an tih. Abraham chu ei rênga pa a nih,"
17,"(as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, even God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.","mithihai sukhringtu le, thil umnawhai a taka inumtirtu, a iring Pathien mithmua chun; “Chi tam- takhai pain siem ka ti che” tia ziek ang khan."
18,"Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be.","Beiseina âwm a um naw khawmin beiseitakin a ring a, chi tamtakhai pa a hung ni theina dingin, “Khi zât khin i thlahai la um an tih,” tia hril ang khan."
19,"And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;","Chun, ringna detlo chuong loin, a taksa thi tah anga um chu a ngaituoh a, ama chu kum za lai mi a ni sih a, Sara ching khawm a ngaituo bawk a."
20,"yet, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God,","Nisienlakhawm, ringna tlasam- in Pathien thutiem chu a ringhla chuong nawh a, Pathien a châwimawi a;"
21,"and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.","a thutiem chu ân hlawtling tir thei ti a ring hle bawk a, a ringna chu a hung det lem tah a."
22,Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.,Chuleiin a ringna chu a felnaa ngai a hung ni tah.
23,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him;","Chuongchun, a ringna chu a felnaa ngai a ni ti ama ta ding chaua ziek a ni nawh a,"
24,"but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,","Isu, ei Lalpa mithi laia inthawka keithotu ringtu einihai ta ding khawmin a nih, ei ringna chu felnaa ngai nîng a tih."
25,"who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.","Chu Isu chu ei suolna leiin inmantirin a um a, thiem ei changna dingin keithoin a um bawk a."
