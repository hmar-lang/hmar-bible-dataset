verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.","Chuongchun, eini mi hrâthai hin mâni lâwmna zawng loin mi hrât nawhai hrât nawna ei tuorpui lem ding a nih."
2,"Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.","Mâni vênghai suksâwtna dingin an ṭhatna dingin suklâwm tum seng ei tiu,"
3,"For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.","Krista khawm chun mâni lâwm- na a zawng si nawh a. “Nangma haltuhai halna che chu keia chungah a tla tah,” ti ziek ang khan a um lem."
4,"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.","Pathien Lekha thua tuorselna le lungmuongna hmua beiseina ei nei theina dingin, inhmaa ziekhai ta- phawt chu eini inchûktirna dinga ziek an ni sih a."
5,Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:,Tuorselna le thlamuongna Pa- thien chun Isu Krista hril angin lungril hmunkhat put dingin inumtir raw se cheu;
6,that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.,"ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pathien le Pa chu, lungril hmunkhat le inthuruola in chawimawi theina dingin."
7,"Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.","Chuleiin, Krista chun Pathien sukropuina dinga a lâwm cheu ang bawk khan, inlâwm tuo seng ro."
8,"For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers,",Hi hi ka ihril chu a nih: thlatuhai kuoma thutiemhai chu sukdet ding le Pathien thu ân dik ti inhriettirna dingin Krista chu sertanhai rawng- bâwltuin a hung um a;
9,"and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.","lunginsietna leia Jentailhaiin Pathien an chawimawi theina dingin; “Chuleiin, Jentailhai lai chun, Inpâk ka ti cheh a, I hming chawimawina dingin Hla sak ka tih,” tia ziek ang khan,"
10,"And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.","Chun, “Nangni Jentail po pohai, A mihai leh lâwm ro,” a ti nâwk a."
11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.","Chun, “Nangni Jentail po pohai, Lalpa chu inpâk ro; Mi po po khawmin, Ama chu inpâk raw se,” a ti nâwk a."
12,"And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.","Chun, Isaiin, “Jessai zung zâm chu um a ta, Jentailhai Lala um dingin, A hung suok ding chu um bawk a ta, Ama chu Jentailhai chun beisei phâng an tih,” a ti nâwk bawk a."
13,"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.",Thlarau Inthieng thilthawthei- na zâra beiseina in hau theina dingin Beiseina Pathien chun ring leia lâwmna le inremna tinrêngin suksip raw se cheu.
14,"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.","Chun, ka unauhai, nangni chungthu chu, nangni ngei ṭhatnain in sip a, varna tinrêng in haua, in inkâwk tuo thei ti kei ngei khawmin indiktakin ka hriet."
15,"But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,","Nisienlakhawm, inhriettir nawn ding cheuin khâwlai lai hin amanih huoitakin ka ziek a nih: Pathienin a mi pêk lunginsietna lei hin Jentailhai laia Krista Isu rawng- bâwltu ka nih."
16,"that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.","Jentailhai inhlânna chu, Thla- rau Inthieng sukthienga lâwmtlâk an ni theina dingin Pathien Chanchin Ṭha kawngah thiempu sin ka thaw a nih."
17,I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.,"Chuongchun, Pathien tieng kawnga chu, Krista Isua chun suong ding ka nei a nih."
18,"For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,",Jentailhai inâwitir dingin Kristain thilthaw le thu hrilin keima mi hmanga a thilthawhai chau naw chu iengkhawm hril ngam si naw ning a;
19,"in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;","inchiknahai, thilmakhai, thil- thawtheinaa le Thlarau Inthieng thilthawtheinaa chun a mi hmang a nih. Chuleiin, Jerusalem le a vêl rama inthawkin Illurikom ram chen- in, Krista Chanchin Ṭha chu ram tinah ka hril kim tah a;"
20,"yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;","mi dang lungphûm chunga rem ka ni nawna dingin, Chanchin Ṭha chu Krista hming lama a umna ta hmuna chun hril loin,"
21,"but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.","“A chanchin la hril ngainawnaa mihai chun Hmûng an ta, A la hre ngainawhai chun, Hrieng an tih,” ti ziek ang khan."
22,Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:,"Chu lei tak khawm chun a nih, in kuoma hung ka ṭhul rawp hlak chu."
23,"but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,","Tu ruok hin chu hieng ram vêla hin sinthawna hmun hrim ka nei ta nawh, kum tamtak chu in kuoma hung inhâwkin ka um ta bawk a,"
24,"whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)—","Spain rama ka fe phaleh ka fe malama hmu cheu ka beisei sih a, nangni pâwl khawp deu zet lang cheu, chu tienga ka zu fenaa khawm chun nangni rawiin in mi zûn thla ka beisei bawk a nih."
25,"but now, I say, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.",Tu ruok hin chu mi inthienghai rawngbâwl dingin Jerusalemah ka fe phawt ding a nih.
26,For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.,"Makedonia le Akaia rama mihai chun lungâwitakin, Jeru- salema mi inthienghai laia mi rim- sihai ta dingin sum an thawlâwm ta sih a."
27,"Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things.","Anih, lungnitaka an thaw a nih, an kuomah an bat hrim bawk a; Jentailhaiin an thlarau tieng thilah an in ṭâwmpui si chun, khawvêl tieng thilin anni sawmdâwl ve thung a ṭûl hrim a nih."
28,"When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.","Chuleiin, chu chu thaw zoa, a ra khawm feltaka anni kân hmutir zoin nangni sir malamin Spain ramah fe pei ka tih."
29,"And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.","Chun, in kuoma ka hung pha chun, Krista Chanchin Ṭha mal- sâwmna famkim phurin hung ka tih ti ka hriet a nih."
30,"Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;","Unauhai, tuhin, in mi ṭawngṭai pêknaa chun ṭhahnemngaitaka mi ṭawngṭai pêk dingin Lalpa Isu Krista le Thlarau Inthieng hmangainain ka ngên cheu a nih:"
31,"that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judæa, and that my ministration which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;","Judai rama awinawhai laia ka him theina ding le Jerusalem ta dinga sawmdâwlna ka ichawi hi, mi inthienghai lâwm zâwngtak a hung ni theina dingin."
32,"that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.","Pathien remti anga hlimtaka in kuomah ka hung a, ei hlim tlâng theina dingin."
33,Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.,Remna Pathien chu in rênga kuomah um raw se. Amen.
