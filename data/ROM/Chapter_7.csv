verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?","Anleh, unauhai, dân chun mi a dam sûng po a chungah ro a rêl hlak ti in hriet naw am an nih? (Dân hre mihai kuomah ka hril a ni hi)."
2,"For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.","Nuhmei pasal nei chu a pasal dam sûng po dânin a pasala khuopdein a um hlak; nisien- lakhawm, a pasal a thi chun, pasal kawngah dâna inthawka insuoin a um hlak."
3,"So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.","Chuongchun, a pasal dam sûnga mi dang a nei chun “uirenu” tîng an tih; a pasal a thi ruok chun, chu dâna inthawk chun inthlain a um a; chuongchun, mi dang nei sien khawm uire a ni ta nawh."
4,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.","Chuongchun, unauhai, Krista taksa pêng in ni leiin dân kawnga sukhlumin in lo um tah a, mi dang, mithi laia inthawka a keitho kha, in nei thei tah, Pathien tienga kan ra theina dingin."
5,"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.",Tisaa ei um lai khan Dân leia nuom zâwng suol hung suokhai chun ei taksa pêngahai thina khawpa ra dingin sin a hung thaw hlak.
6,"But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.","Tu ruok hin chu a mi cheltu chu thisanin, Dâna inthawkin inthlain ei um tah; chuleichun lekha ziek hlui ang ni loin, Thlarau tharin rawng ei bâwl theina dingin."
7,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:","Ieng am hril tâng ei ta? Dân chu suol am a nih? Teu lo e a; Nisien- lakhawm, Dân leia hriet ni naw sien chu suol ka hriet naw ding bah; Dân chun, “Inhnar naw,” ti naw sien chu inhnar hi ka hriet naw ding bah."
8,"but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin is dead.","Nisienlakhawm, suolin thupêk lei chun remchâng lai hmuin, inhnarna tinrêng ka sûngah ân umtir a. Dân naw chun suolna chu a thi a nih."
9,"And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;","Chun, kha hma khan kei dân nei loin ka hring a; nisienlakhawm, thupêk chu a hung um phingleh suolna chu a hung har a, kei chu ka thi tah a."
10,"and the commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death:","Chun, hringna dinga thupêk chu thina ding lem a nih ti ka hung hriet tah a;"
11,"for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.","suolna chun thupêk lei chun, remchângna hmuin a mi lo hlêm a, thupêk chu hmangin a mi sukhlum tah a nih."
12,"So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.","Chuongchun, Dân chu ân thieng a, thupêk khawm chu ân thieng a, a fel a, a ṭha a nih."
13,"Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good;—that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.","Anleh, thil ṭha chu keia ta dingin thina a lo ni am a nih? Teu lo e a! Suolna chu keia ta dingin thina a hung ni ta lem a nih; chuongchun, suolna chu suolna a nih ti ân lang theina dingin, thil ṭha chu hmangin a mi sukhlum a nih. Suolna chu thupêk lei khan suol nasatak a ni theina dingin."
14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.","Dân chu Thlarau tieng thil a nih ti ei hriet sih a; kei ruok chu tisa tienga mi, suol suoka zawr ta hnung ka nih."
15,"For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.","Sin ka thawhai hi a ngaina ka hriet si nawh a, ka thaw hlakhai hi ka thaw nuom zâwng khawm a ni si nawh a; ka itheida zâwngtak chu ka thaw lem hlak a nih."
16,"But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.","Ka thaw nuom naw zâwng chu ka thaw si chun, Dân chu a ṭha tia awi nîng ka tih."
17,"So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.","Chuongchun, thil ka thawhai hi keiin ka thaw a ni ta nawh a, suolna keimaa um chun a thaw a ni lem a nih."
18,"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good is not.","Keimaa hin, chu chu ka tisaa hin tina a nih, thil ṭha hrim a um nawh ti ka hriet, thil ṭha thaw nuomna chu keimaah a umdea chu, thil ṭha thawna chu a um si nawh a."
19,"For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.","Ṭhatna thaw ka nuoma chu ka thaw naw a, suolna ka thaw nuom naw chu ka thaw sih a."
20,"But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.","Ka nuom naw zâwng ka thaw si chun, a thawtu chu kei ka ni ta nawh a, suol keimaa um chu a ni lem a nih."
21,"I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.","Chuongchun, hi dân hi ka hung hriet suok tah; thil ṭha thaw ka nuom laiin suolna ka kuomah a hung um hlak a nih."
22,For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:,Ka lungril takin Pathien dân chungah ka lâwm si hlak a;
23,"but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.","nisienlakhawm, ka taksa pêng- haia hin dân danglam a um ti ka hriet, chu chun ka lungrila dân chu a do a, ka taksa pênghaia suolna dân umhai chun salah a mi ṭhuoi a nih."
24,Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?,Mi rimsi ka va ni ngei de aw! Hi thina taksaa inthawk hin tuin am mi sansuok a ta?
25,"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.","Isu Krista ei Lalpa lei chun Pathien kuomah lâwmthu ka hril a nih. Chuongchun, keima tak chun, ka lungril chun, Pathien dân rawng ka bâwl hlak, ka tisa ruok chun suolna dân rawng ka bâwl hlak."
