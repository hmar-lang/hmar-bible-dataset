1,"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.","Chuongchun, unauhai, Pa- thien lunginsietna lei hin in- thâwina hring le inthieng le Pathien ilâwmtlâk ni dingin, in taksa chu inhlân dingin ka ngên cheu a nih; chu chu in rawngbâwlna âwm hrim a nih."
2,"And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.","Hi khawvêl dân ang hin um naw unla, Pathien dit zâwng a ṭha le lâwmtlâk le ṭha famkim chu in hriet chieng theina dingin, in lungril a thara umin, hung danglam lem ta ro khai."
3,"For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.","Pathienin a mi pêk lunginsietna lei hin in laia tukhawmin in ingaihlu tâwk bâka inngaihlu loin, Pathienin mi tin kuoma ringna huntâwk a pêk ang peiin, feltaka ngaituo lem dingin ka ti seng cheu a nih."
4,"For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office:","Taksa pumkhatah pêng tamtak ei nei a, a pêng po po sinthaw chu an âng vawng nawh a;"

6,"And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;","Lunginsietna ei kuoma pêk ang sengin thilthlâwnpêk hi a tum tum ei nei seng a, thu hril ding a ni chun, ei ringna phutâwk peiin hril ei tiu;"
7,"or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching;","rawngbâwl ding a ni chun ei rawngbâwlnaa chun inpe tlat ei tiu, inchûktirtu khawmin inchûktir tlat raw se;"
8,"or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.","mi infuitu khawma infui raw se; thil petu khawmin inro loin pe raw se, rorêltu chun taimatakin ro rêl raw se; mi lunginsiettu khawmin lâwmtakin lunginsiet raw se."
9,Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.,"Hmangaina chu vervêkna ṭhang loin ni raw se. Suol tieng chu theida unla, ṭha tieng chu pawm tlat ro."
10,In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;,Unauhai hmangai kawnga chun inhmangai takin inlainat tuo seng ro; chawimawi kawnga chun inditsak tuo seng ro;

15,Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.,"Lâwmhai chu lâwmpui unla, ṭaphai chu ṭappui ro."
16,"Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.","Ngaituo hmunkhatin um tuo seng unla, inngaituo sâng taluo naw unla, mi chînhai inruolpui lem ro. Intivar naw ro."
17,Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.,"Tu suol khawm suolin thung naw ro, mi po po ngaia thil mawi chu ngaituo lâwk ro."
18,"If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.",A thei phawt chun nangni tieng bêk mi po po le inremin um ro.
19,"Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath of God: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.","Dittakhai, in phuba la naw unla, Pathien lunginsenna inkien lem ro, “phuba hrim hrim keia lâk ding a nih, keiin thung ka tih, Lalpain a tih,” ti ziek a ni sih a."
20,"But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.","Chuleiin, i hmêlma a phîng a ṭâm chun fâk ding pe la, a dang a châr chun dâwn ding pe rawh; chuong anga i thaw chun a lu chunga meiling i sie khâwl nîng a tih."
21,"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.","Suol ihnein um naw la, ṭhatnain suol chu hne lem rawh."
