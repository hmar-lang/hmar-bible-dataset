1,"But him that is weak in faith receive ye, yet not for decision of scruples.","Chun, ringnaa hrât naw mi chu, a ringhlana sawisêl loin, lâwm lem ro."
2,One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.,"Mi pakhatin iengkim fa theiin ân ring a, mi hrât naw ruok chun thlai chau a fâk hlak."
3,Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.,Iengkim fa mi chun a fa naw chu hmusit naw raw se; a fa naw khawm chun a fatu chu sawisêl naw raw se; Pathienin ama chu a lâwm tah annâwm.
4,"Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.","Mi dang siehlaw sawisêltu chu tu am i ni leh? a ngîr le a tlûk chu ama hotupa ta ding a nih. Nisienlakhawm, ama chu inngirtirin um a tih, Lalpa chun ân ngîrtir thei sih a."
5,One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.,"Mi pakhatin ni khat hi ni dang nêkin a ngaihlu bîk hlak a, mi dangin ni po po chu inang sengin a ngai hlak a nih. Mi tin mani lungrilah inhre chieng raw se."
6,"He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.","Ni insertu chun, Lalpa chawi- mawina dingin ân ser hlak a na. Iengkim fatu chun, Pathien kuomah lâwm thu a hril a, Lalpa chawi- mawina dingin a fâk hlak a nih; a fa nawtu khawm chun, Pathien kuomah lâwm thu a hril a, Pathien chawimawina dingin a fâk naw hlak a nih."
7,"For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.","Tûkhawm mâni ta dinga hring ei ni nawh a, tûkhawm mâni ta dinga thi ei ni bawk nawh."
8,"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.","Ei hring chun Lalpa ta dingin ei hring a, ei thi khawmin Lalpa ta dingin ei thi a ni sih a; chuleiin, ei hring khawmin ei thi khawmin Lalpa ta ei nih."
9,"For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.",Krista thina le a hung hring nâwkna san chu mi dam le mi thi Lalpa a ni theina hi a ni sih a.
10,"But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.","Nisienlakhawm, nangin ieng dinga i unau i sawisêl am a na? annawleh, nangin ieng dinga i unau i hmusit am a na? Pathien rorêlna ṭhungpha hmaah ei rêngin ei la ngîr ding a ni sih a."
11,"For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God.","“Lalpa chun, ‘Mi tinrêng Ka hmaah kûn an ta, Lei tinrêng khawm Pathien kuomah inphuong an tih,’ Tiin ṭawng kân khâm a nih,” a tih a, ti ziek ang khan."
12,So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.,"Chuongchun, ei rêngin Pathien kuomah mâni chanchin ei hril seng ding a nih."
13,"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.","Chuleiin, insawisêl tâwl ta nâwm ei niu khai; tûkhawmin mâni unau kalna amanih tlûkna amanih siem naw tum lem seng ro."
14,"I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.","Ama le ama ngawt chun ân thieng naw iengkhawm a um nawh ti Lalpa Isua chun ka hriet hle a nih, thil inthieng loa ngaitu ta ding chun, ama ta ding chun ân thieng naw a nih."
15,"For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.","I thil fâk leia i unau lungril a na chun, hmangai dân kawng chu i hraw ta nâw a nih. A thi ai Kristain a thipêk chu i thil fâkin sukbo naw rawh."
16,Let not then your good be evil spoken of:,"Chuongchun, in ta dinga ṭhatna chu suola hrilin um naw raw se;"
17,"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.","Pathien ram chu dâwn le fâk tieng thu a ni si nawh a; felna dâm, inremna dâm, Thlarau Inthienga lâwmna dâm a ni lem ie."
18,"For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.","Tûkhawm, chuong thua Krista rawng bâwl chu, Pathien lâwm zâwng le mihriem inpâkin a um hlak."
19,"So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.","Chuongchun, inremna le insuk- sâwt tuona ding thilhai chu hnawt ei tiu."
20,Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.,"I thil fâk leiin Pathien sinthaw sukse naw. Thil po po chu ân thieng ngei, nisienlakhawm, a thil fâkin mi a sukthlûk chun, a fatu ta dingin suol a nih."
21,"It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth.","I unau tlûkna ding a ni chun, sa fâk lo dâm, uoin dâwn lo dâm, thil iengkhawm thaw lo a ṭha lem a nih."
22,"The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.",Ringna i nei chu Pathien hmaah nang chau ihrietin nei el rawh. Mâni ṭha ti kawnga thiemnaw inchangtir naw chu a ham ṭha.
23,"But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.","Amiruokchu, ringhlatuin a fâk chun, ringnain a fâk naw leiin thiemnaw a chang a nih; iengkhawm ringna boa thaw chu suol a ni sih a."
