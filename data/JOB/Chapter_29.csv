1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said,","Chun, Job chun a thuhril chu a zawm nâwk a, a hril tah a:"
2,"Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;","“Aw thla hlui tahaia ang khan um la ni lang chu aw, Pathienin a mi vêng lai nihai anga khan;"
3,"When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness;","A khâwnvar ka lu chungah a var lai, A var ringa inthimna ka fe thleng lai khan;"
4,"As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent;","Ka vânglai nihaia ka um anga, Pathien thurâwn chu ka puon in chunga a um lai khan;"
5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;","Iengkimthawthei chu ka kuomah a um a, Ka nauhai khawm ka sirah an um lai khan;"
6,"When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil!","Ka kaiṭênhai chu nênetui khala sâwp a nih a, Lungpui chun hriek vadunghai chu a min suopêk hlak lai khan!"
7,"When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street,","“Khawpui dai kawtkhâra ka va fe suok a, Kawtthlêra chun ṭhunghmun ka rem chun,"
8,"The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;","Tlangvâlhai chun an mi hmuh a, an inbi a, Upahai khawm chu an tho a, an ngîr hlak a,"
9,"The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;","Lalnauhai khawm chun an inbiek an mah a, An kuthai chun an bau chu an hup a;"
10,"The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.","Mi ṭhahai râwlhai khawm chu a hung reh a, An leihai chu an dang chungah a kawp tah a."
11,"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me:","Nain a mi hriet chun, mal a mi sâwm hlak sih a, Mit khawma a mi hmu chun, ka kuomah hrietpuina a pêk a;"
12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.","Mi rimsi khêk chu ka sansuokin, Fahra ama ṭhangpuitu ding neilo khawm chu ka sansuok hlak leiin,"
13,The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.,"A malsâwmna bohmang ṭêp khawm chu ka kuomah a hungin, Hmeithai lungril chu hlima hlasak dingin kân umtir hlak."
14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.","Felna chu ka sil a, chu chun a mi thuom a, Ka felna chu lalpuon le lukâwm ang a nih."
15,"I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.","Mitdel ta dingin mithai ka na, Kebâi ta dingin kehai ka nih."
16,I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.,"Tlasam ta dingin pa ka na, Chun, a chungthu ka hriet naw khawm chu ka zawng suok hlak."
17,"And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.","Mi fello ha chu ka sukthliek a, A sa fâk chu a haa inthawk chun ka lâk suok hlak."
18,"Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand:","Chun, ‘Ka bua chun thîng ka ta, Ka nihai chu phaiphin zâtin sukpung ka tih,’ ka tih a."
19,"My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch:","Ka zung chu tuihai chenin ân zâm a, Ka zâr chunga chun zânkhawvârin dâidaw chu a kûr bawk a."
20,"My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.","Ka ropuina chu keimaa chun a thar a, Ka kuta chun ka thalngul chu siemtharin a um bawk a."
21,"Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.","“Ka kuomah miin na an sit a, an nghâk a, Ka thurâwn chu ngaiin an to hlak."
22,After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them.,"Ka thu hnungahai chun thu an hril nâwk ta ngai nawh a, Ka ṭawng chu an chungah a tla a."
23,And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.,"Ruo nghâk angin kei an mi nghâk a, Ruo nuhnung tieng nghâk angin an bau an ka lien a."
24,"I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.","Anni kân nuipui a, an inring naw laiin, Ka hmêlput hlimum chu an pei thlâk chuong nawh a."
25,"I chose out their way, and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.","An lampui ka thlang suok a, lal angin ka ṭhung a, Sipai laia lal tak angin ka khawsa a, Mi thlavaihai thlamuongtu ang elin."
