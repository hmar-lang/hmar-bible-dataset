2,"How long will ye vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words?","“Ieng chen am ka thla chu in suklâuin, Thuhai chun in mi suknâwi ding a na?"
3,These ten times have ye reproached me: Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.,"Hieng vawi sâwm rau hi in mi kâwk tah a, Ngartaka in mi thaw hi in inzak naw a ni hi."
4,"And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine error remaineth with myself.","Ka lo suksuol ta ngei a ni chun chu, Ka suksuolna chu keimaa chun um zing el a ta."
5,"If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach;","Keia chunga nangni inchawimawi in ni a, Ka demumna keia chunga zawng suok in ni chun,"
6,"Know now that God hath subverted me in my cause, And hath compassed me with his net.","Pathien chun ka chungthuah tuhin a mi pei thlâk tah a, A lên chun a mîn khum tah ti hre ro."
7,"Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no justice.","Ngai ta u, ‘Pâwngnêkna,’ tiin ka khêk a, Nisienlakhawm, ngaiin ka um nawh a; Ṭhangpuina dingin ka khêk a, nisienlakhawm, rorêlna dik a um si nawh a."
8,"He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass, And hath set darkness in my paths.","Ka suok thei nawna dingin ka lampui chu ân huon a, Ka lampuiahai chun inthimna chu a sie tah a nih."
9,"He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head.","Ka lua inthawk chun ka lallukhum chu la hmangin, Ka ropuina chu a mi hlîppêk ta a ni hi."
10,"He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.","Kil tina chun a mi hung suksiet a, chuongchun, kei chu ka fe liem tah a; Ka beiseina khawm chu thing ang elin a lâk hmang tah a."
11,"He hath also kindled his wrath against me, And he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries.","A lunginsenna chu ka chungah a sukchawk a, A hmêlma pakhat ang chun a mi ngai tah a."
12,"His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent.","A sipaihai chu an hung khâwm a, keima tieng lampui an hung siem a, Ka puon in vêlin ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
13,"He hath put my brethren far from me, And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.","Ka unauhai chu keimaa inthawka hlatakah a sieh a, Ka hmêlhriethai hlak chu keia chungah an inthuruol a."
14,"My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me.","Ka laibunghai hlakin an mi nghatsan a, Ka ruol pâwlngeihai hlakin an mi theinghil ta bawk a."

17,"My breath is strange to my wife, And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.","Ka thuok chu ka nuhmei kuoma chun mak a lo ni tah a, Ka nu rîla rahai ngei kuoma ka hnina khawm chu nghawkum a lo ni tah a."
18,"Even young children despise me; If I arise, they speak against me.","Naupanghai khawm chun an mi hmusit a, Ka tho leh, ka chungah an mi sawisêl a."
19,"All my familiar friends abhor me, And they whom I loved are turned against me.","Ka ruol bulhai po po hlak chun an mi pâwlser a, Ka hmangai takhai khawm chu ka chungah an hel a."
20,"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.","Ka vun le ka tisa hi ka rua chun a kawp ringawt a, Ka hahai vun ruok chu ka la chang a."
21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me.","Aw nangni ka ruolhai, mi lunginsiet ro, mi lunginsiet ro, Pathien kut chun a mi hung tâwk ta sih a."
22,"Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?","Pathien ang el chun iengdinga in mi hrem a, Ka tisaa hin lungawi tâwk lo am in nih a?"
23,Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!,"“Aw ka thuhai hi tuhin ziekin um sien, Aw, lekhabua chun ziek tlatin um hai sien chu aw!"
24,That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for ever!,"Thîr le suon kawlawm chun ziekin um sien, Lungpuia chun kumkhuoa dingin kerin um hai sien chu!"

26,"And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;","Chuong anga ka vun chena sukbohmang a ni hnung khawm chun, Ka taksa ngei chun Pathien chu la hmûng ka tih."
27,"Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side, And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me.","Ama chu ka ta ding ngeiin hmu tâng ka ta, Ka mithai chun en a ta, mi dang chu en naw ni. Ka lungril chu ka sûnga chun ân tuiral a."
28,"If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me;","‘Iengtin am ama chu sukrimsîng ei ti aw! Amaa chun hi thil zung hi hmusuok a nih,’ in ti chun,"
29,"Be ye afraid of the sword: For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a judgment.","Kâwlhnâm chu ṭi ro. Lunginsenna chun kâwlhnâma hremnahai chu a hung lâk suok hlak sih a; Rorêlna chu a um ti in hriet theina dingin,” tiin."
