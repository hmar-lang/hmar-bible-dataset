1,"Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,","Chun, Job chun LALPA chu a dawn a, a hril tah a:"
2,"I know that thou canst do all things, And that no purpose of thine can be restrained.","“Thil po pohai chu i thaw thei vawng ti ka hriet a, I thiltum khawm dang ruol a ni nawh a."
3,"Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.","Hrietna um loa, thurâwn thuptu hi tu am a na? Chuleiin, ka ihriet naw chu ka hril el a nih;"
4,"Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.","Ngai ta, ka ngên che hi, thu ka hril ding a nih: Nang chu indawn ka ti che a, mi hrilfie bawk rawh."
5,I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; But now mine eye seeth thee:,"Naa hrietna chun nangma chu ka hriet ta cheh a, Tu ruok hin chu ka mit hin a hmu che a ni hi."
6,"Wherefore I abhor myself, And repent in dust and ashes.","Chuleiin, kei le kei kân theidah a, kân sîr a nih, Vuthai lai le pilvut laia ṭhungin,” tiin."
7,"And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.","Chun, LALPA chun Job kuoma hieng thuhai hi a hril zo chun LALPA chun, Teman mi Eliphaz kuoma chun, “Nanga chunga le i ruol pahni hai chunga chun ka lungsenna chu a hung zuol a nih, ka siehlaw Job anga keima chungthua thil indik chu in mi hrilpêk naw leiin."
8,"Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.","Chuleiin, tuhin bâwngchal pasa- ri le berâmchal pasari kei unla; ka siehlaw Job kuoma chun fe unla, nangni ta ngei dingin pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu inhlân ro; chun, ka siehlaw Job chun ṭawngṭaipêk a ti cheu a, ama a ni leiin, kei khawma pawm ka tih, in invêtna ang peia ka thaw nawna ding cheu in. Ka siehlaw Job angin keima chungthua thil indik chu in mi hrilpêk ta si nawh a,” tiin."
9,"So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded them: and Jehovah accepted Job.","Chuongchun, Teman mi Eliphaz le, Suhi mi Bildad leh, Naamath mi Zophar le chun an feh a, LALPAIN anni thu a pêk ang chun an thawh a. Chun, LALPA chun Job chu a pawm- pêk tah a."
10,"And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.","Chun, LALPA chun Job chu a ruolhai ta dinga a ṭawngṭai lai chun a chan chu a sukṭha tah a; Job chu LALPA chun a hmaa a nei lêt hni chu a pêk tah a."
11,"Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.","Chun, a unauhai po po, a farnu- hai po po leh, a hmaa a lo hmêlhriet tahai chu a kuomah an hung a, a ina chun ama leh bu an fâk tâwl a, a chunga LALPAIN thil ṭha naw ân tlungtir po pohaia chun ama chu an thlasietpuiin an thlamuon a, mi tin chun sum tlâwmte seng le, rângka- chak kutsebi an pêk seng a."
12,"So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Job chu a hun tâwp tieng chun a hun hmasa tieng nêk hmanin mal a sâwm tah a: berâm chu sîng khat le sâng li a nei a, sanghâwngsei sâng ruk leh, bâwngchal tuok sâng khat leh, sabengtungpui sâng khat a nei tah a."
13,He had also seven sons and three daughters.,Naupasal pasari le naunuhmei pathum a nei bawk a.
14,"And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.","Chun, a upatak hminga chun Jemima a sak a, a pahnina hminga chun Kezia, a pathumna hminga chun Keren-happuk a sak a."
15,And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.,"Chun, ram po poa chun Job nau- nuhmeihai anga hmêlṭha hrim hrim hmu an ni nawh a, an pa chun an unaupahai laia chun rochan a pêk seng bawk a."
16,"And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.","Hi hnunga hin Job chu kum za khat le sâwmli a la dam a, a nau- pasalhai le a naupasalhai naupasal- hai, khup li chenin a hmuh a."
17,"So Job died, being old and full of days.","Chuongchun, nihai chu tling zetin le hung tarin Job chu a thi tah a."
