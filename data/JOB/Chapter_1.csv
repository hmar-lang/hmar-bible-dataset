1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.","Uz rama chun mi pakhat a um a, a hming chu Job a nih; chu mipa chu mi fel le tluong le, Pathien ṭi a suol nghatsan mi a nih;"
2,And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.,Ama chun naupasal pasari le naunuhmei pathum a nei a.
3,"His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.","A ran ruol khawm chu berâm sâng sari, sanghâwngsei sâng thum, bâwngchal tuok za nga, sabengtung- pui za nga le insûng ropuitak el leh a nih; chuongchun, chu mipa chu khaw- sak rama mihai po po laia a ropui tak a nih."
4,And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.,"A naupasalhai chu an hunbi peiah an inhaia fein, ruoi an ṭhe insâwk hlak a: mi an tir a, an farnu pathumhai chu anni le faa dâwn dingin an ko hlak a."
5,"And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.","Chun, an ruoiṭhena nihai vêl chu a kim pha chun Job chun ân chah a, anni chu a hlânthieng hlak a; zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, an rênga anni nizât hming kimin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai ân hlân a: Job chun, “Ka naupasalhai hin thil lo suksuol- in, an lungrilhaiah Pathien hrilsie hlau rawi an tih,” a ti sih a. Chuong ang chun Job chun a thaw rawp hlak a."
6,"Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.",Tuhin Pathien naupahai chu LALPA hmaa inlang dinga an hung ni a um a; Setan khawm anni lai a hung veh a.
7,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Nang khâwtienga inthawka hung am i na?” a ta. Setan chun LALPA chu a dawn a, “Hnuoia kân vâk vêlnaa le chutaka a suk a tunga inlawnnaa inthawkin,” a ta."
8,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.","Chun, LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Ka siehlaw Job hi i ngaituo hlak am? Hnuoi chunga hin ama anga mi fel le, mi tluong le, Pathien ṭi mi le, suol nghatsan mi an um si nawh a,” a tih a."
9,"Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?","Setan chun LALPA chu a dawn a, “Job chun Pathien chu teplo elin a ṭi ding maw chu?"
10,"Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.","Ama vêla le, a in le a nei po po, a sîr tina chun paldâi i siempêk a ni naw am a nih? A kuthai sinthaw chu mal i sâwm a, a ran ruol chu hi rama hin a hung pung tah a."
11,"But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin i kut phar la, a thil nei po po chu tâwk la, i hmâisanah hrilse ngei ngei a ti che,” a ta."
12,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, a thil nei po pohai chu i thuneina hnuoia um an nih; ama chunga chau chun i kut chu inlet naw rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, Setan chu LALPA hmâihmaa inthawk chun a fe suok tah a."
13,"And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,","Chun, ni khat chu a naupa- salhai le a naunuhmeihai chun an unaupa a upa tak ina an fâk a, uoin an dâwn laiin,"
14,"that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;","Job kuoma chun thangko a hung tah a, “Bâwngchalhai chun hnuoi an inlet a, an sîra chun sabeng- tunghai chu an tlah a;"
15,"and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.","Seba mihaiin anni an thawh a, an lâk rip el a; anih, siehlawhai chu kâwlhnâm ngeiin an that a; chuong- chun, nangma hril ding chein kei chau hi ka hung inrel suok a nih,” a ta."
16,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.","Ama chun a la hril zing laiin mi dang khawm a hung veh a, “Vâna inthawkin Pathien mei a hung tla a, berâm ruol le siehlawhai chu a kâng a, a kâng hmang vawng tâwl el a; chuongchun, kei chau a hril ding chein ka hung suok a nih,” a ta."
17,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.","Ama chun a la hril lai zing chun mi dang a hung ve nâwk a, “Kaldaihai chu pâwl thumin an insiem a, sa- nghâwngseihai chu an thawh a, anni chu an lâk hmang rip el a; kâwlhnâm ngeiin siehlawhai chu an that a: a hril ding chein kei chau ka hung inrel suok a nih,” a ta."
18,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;","A la hril lai zing chun mi dang khawm a hung nâwk veh a, “I naupa- salhai le i naunuhmeihai chu an unaupa upa tak inah uoin an dâwnin an fâk a:"
19,"and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.","ngai ta, thlalêr tienga inthawk- in thli nasatak el a hung a, in kil lia chun a mût a, tlangvâlhai chu a tlûk khum a, an thi vawng tah a; a hril ding chein kei chau hi ka hung suok a nih,” a ta."
20,"Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;","Chun, Job chu a tho a, a puon a keithlêr a, a lu a vâwkawl a, hnuoi chunga bawkkhupin Pathien chibai a bûk tah a."
21,"and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.","“Ka nu phîng sûnga inthawkin saruokin ka hung suok a, saruok bawkin kîr nâwk ka tih; LALPA chun a pêk a, LALPA chun a lâk hmang nâwk tah a ni chu; LALPA hming chu inpâkin um raw se,” a ta."
22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.","Hieng thil po poa hin Job chun a suksuol nawh a, invêtthlâktakin Pathien chu a mawsiet bawk nawh."
