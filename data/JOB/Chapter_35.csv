2,"Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s,","“Hi hi indikin i ngaituo am a nih? Annawleh, ‘Ka felna chu Pathien felna nêkin a nasa lem,’ i ti am a nih?"
3,"That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?",‘I ta dingin ieng am a ṭhatna a um a? Ka suksuol naw hi ieng am ka hlâwkna a um a?’ i ti a nih.
4,"I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee.","Nanga kuoma i ruolhai le, Nang ka hung dawn ding che a nih."
5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.","Vânhai tieng khi ngha la, en ta; Sûmhai khi en ta, nanga nêkin an insâng lem a nih."
6,"If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?","Thil suol i lo thaw ta chun, ama chungah ieng am i thawh a? I bawsietnahai chu a hung pung chun, ieng am i thawpêk a?"
7,"If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand?","I fel a ni chun, ama chu ieng am i pêk a? Annawleh, i kuta inthawkin ama chun ieng am a hmuh a?"
8,Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; And thy righteousness may profit a son of man.,"I rîtlona chun nangma ang bawkin mi a sukna thei a, Chun, i felna chun mihriem naupa chu a sukhlâwk thei a nih."
9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.,"“Nêksâwrna tamtakhai lei chun an khêk a, Mi hrât bân leiin ṭhangpuina ngênin an khêk bawk a."
10,"But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night,","Nisienlakhawm, tukhawma, ‘Kei a mi Siemtu Pathien chu khâwlai am a um a, Zâna khawm hlahai pe hlaktu chu?"
11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?","Ama hnuoia ramsahai nêka mîn chûktir nasa lem a, Chunglêng vatehai nêka var lema mi siemtu chu?’ an ti nawh."
12,"There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.","Chutaka chun an khêk a, nisienlakhawm, tukhawmin dawnna an pêk nawh, Mi suolhai chapona lei chun."

15,"But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;","Amiruokchu, tuhin, a lunginsennain a hung hrem nawh a, Chapona chu a ngaisak bawk nawh a;"
16,Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.,"Chuleiin, Job hin teplo mei meiin a bau chu a kah a, Hrietna nei loin thuhai chu a sukpung a ni hi,” tiin."
