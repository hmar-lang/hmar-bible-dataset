1,"Then Job answered and said,","Chun, Job chun a dawn a, a hril tah a,"
2,I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all.,"“Chuong thilhai tamtak chu ka hriet tah a, Thlamuongtu nghawkum in ni vawng a nih."
3,Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?,"Teplo thuhai chun tâwp an nei ding am a nih? Annawleh, dawn dingin iengin am a suktho che a?"
4,"I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.","Ka nina hi in nina ni sienla chu, In ṭawng ang bawkin ka ṭawng thei a, In chungah thuhai ka zawmkhâwm thei a, In chungah ka lu ka thin el thei a nih."
5,"But I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage your grief.","Amiruokchu, ka bauin sukhrât ka ti cheu a, Ka hmûrhaia hnêmna chun i lungngaina chu suknêp a tih."
6,"Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?","“Thu ka hrila chu ka lungngaina chu suknêp a ni nawh a, Ka tuor fan fana chu, ieng am ka sâwldam chuong a?"
7,But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company.,"Amiruokchu, tuhin a mi sukrimsitu hin, Ka ruolhai po po chu i mîn pâwlsertir zo an ta hi."
8,"And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face.","Keima chu inchuornain i mi suksip a, Chu chu ka chunga hrietpuinahai chu an nih, Chun, ka derdêpna chu ka chungah a tho a, Ka hmaisan ngeiah a mi kâwk a."
9,"He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.","A lunginsenin a mi kei nâwi a, a mi hrem tah a; Ka chunga chun a ha a mi râwt khum a, Ka hmêlma chun ka chungah a mitsîr a sukngei a."
10,They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me.,Ka chungah an bau an mi kâk khum a; Hmusittakin ka biengah an mi ben a; Ka chunga chun anni chu an pungkhâwm a.
11,"God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.","Pathien chun Pathien ngaisak nawhai kuoma chun a mi pêk suok a, Mi rilohai kutahai chun a mi pei lût tah a."
12,"I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark.","Sâwldamin ka um a, ama chun a mi kei nâwi neng a, Anih, ka rîngah a mi man a, innâwi nengin a mi pei tah a. Ama inchikna dinga chun a mi sie ta bawk a."
13,"His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.","A thalkâptuhai chun ka vêlin an mîn huol a, Ka kalhai chu a sukkawi a, a hla hrim hrim nawh a, Ka mît chu hnuoi chungah a bunthlâk a."
14,He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.,"A hlawp hlawpin a mi kei nâwi a, Mi hrât angin ka chunga chun a mi chîl thlûk tah a."
15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.","Ka vun chunga dingin saiip puon ka ṭhui a, Ka ki chu pilvutah ka sukbal tah a."
16,"My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;","Ka hmai chu ṭapnain a hung sen a, Ka mitreiahai chun thina hlim chu a um a;"
17,"Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.","Ka kutahai chun inrawmna a um naw a, Ka ṭawngṭaina chu ân thieng a."
18,"O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place.","“Aw leihnuoi, ka thisen chu inkhum naw la, Ka ṭapna chun châwlhmun nei naw raw se."
19,"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high.","Ngai ta, tu khawm hin ka hrietpuina chu vânah a um a, Ka ta dinga hre zingtu chu chungtieng a um a nih."
20,"My friends scoff at me: But mine eye poureth out tears unto God,","Ka ruolhai chun an mi nuisan a; Nisienlakhawm, ka mit chun Pathien kuoma chun mitthli ân sûr a nih."
21,"That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!",Ama chun mihriem nau thuneina chu Pathien kuomah ṭan ta ve sien chu aw! Miin a vênghai a ṭan ang chun.
22,"For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.","Kum tlâwmte a hung ni pha chun, Lampui ka kîr nâwk nawna dinga chun ka fe âwm sih a."
