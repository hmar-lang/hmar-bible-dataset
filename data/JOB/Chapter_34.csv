1,"Moreover Elihu answered and said,","Chun, Elihu chun a hril a:"
2,"Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.","“Nangni mi varhai, ka thuhai hi lo ngai ta u; Nangni hrietna neituhai, keia tieng in na lo sit ta u."
3,"For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.","Dangin fâk ding ân tem ang bawkin, Na chun thuhai chu a fie hlak sih a."
4,Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good.,Ân dik taphawt chu eini ta dingin thlang ei ta. A ṭha chu eini lai hre bawk ei tiu khai.
5,"For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right:","Job chun, ‘Kei chu ka fel a nih, Pathien chun ka thiemna chu a lâk hmang tah a."
6,"Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.","Ka thiemna chunga chun kân khêl ding am a nih? Bawsietna bo ni lang khawm, ka hliemna chu sukdam thei lo a nih,’ a ti sih a."
7,"What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water,","Job ang hi mi tu am an um a, Hmusitna tui ang ela dâwn a,"
8,"Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?","Rîtlona thawtuhai le hmunkhata feh a, Mi rilohai le intlawn hlak chu?"
9,"For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God.","Ama chun, ‘Mihriem ta dingin ieng khawm a ṭhahnem nawh,’ ti siin, Pathiena chun ama chu a lâwm chu."
10,"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.","Chuleiin, nangni hrietthiemna neihai, mi lo ngai ta u, Rîtlona thâwng a tih ti hi Pathiena inthawka hlatak a ni ding a na, Suolna thâwng a tih ti hi, Iengkimthawtheia inthawka hlatak a ni ding a nih."
11,"For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.","Mi chu a sinthaw ang peiin ama kuomah a pêk ding a na, A lampuihai ang peiin mi tin chu ân hmutir ding a ni hi."
12,"Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.","Anih, matheiloin, Pathien chun rilotakin thaw naw tawp a ta, Iengkimthawthei chun rorêlna chu sukdanglam bawk naw ni."
13,Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?,"Hnuoi chunga enkawl dingin tuin am thu a pêk a? Annawleh, khawvêl pumpui hi tuin am a chungah ân nghat leh?"
14,"If he set his heart upon himself, If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;","Ama le ama chunga chun a lung inkîr lêt sienla, Ân thuokna le a thlarau chu ama kuoma chun la khâwm sienla chu;"
15,"All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust.","Tisa po po chu bohmang vawng an ta, Mihriem chu pilvuta bawk kîr nâwk el a tih."
16,"If now thou hast understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.","“Tuhin, hrietthiemna i nei chun chu, hi hi lo ngai la, Ka thuhai ri chu lo ngai raw khai."
17,Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?—,"Indikna theidatu chun ro a rêl ding am a nih? Mi indik le mi hrât chu i dem ding am a ni,"
18,"Him that saith to a king, Thou art vile, Or to nobles, Ye are wicked;","Lal kuomah, ‘I suol a nih’ tih a, Mi ṭhahai kuomah, ‘In rilo a nih’ titu;"
19,"That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.","Lalnauhai khawm inza biklo, Hausahai khawm mi rimsi nêka ngaisâng chuong lotu chu? An rêngin a kutsuokhai an ni sih a."
20,"In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.","Mitkhapkâr loin an thih a, zânrila ngei khawm; Mihai chu sukhnîngin an um a, an fe hmang tah a; Mi thilthawtheihai khawm chu kut ṭhangloa lâkin an um bawk a."
21,"For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings.","A mithai chu mihriem lampuihai chunga chun a fuh a, A fe vêl po po khawm chu a hmu zing a."
22,"There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.","Thina hlim amanih, inthimna amanih khawm a um nawh, Thil khawhlo thawtuhai an inbîkna ding hmun chu."
23,"For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.","Mihriem chunga chun chantâwk bâk nêka nasa chu innghat naw nih a, Pathien hmaa chun rorêlnaah a fe ding a nih."
24,"He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, And setteth others in their stead.","Mi hrâthai chu a nawi tiem sêngloin suknawi a ta, An aiah mi danghai sie thung a tih."
25,"Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.","Chuleiin, an sinthawhai chu a hriet a, Zâna chun ân letling a, chuongchun, suksiet an ni tah a."
26,He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;,"Mi rilohai angin anni a vuok a, Mi danghai mithmua chun;"
27,"Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:",Ama chu zui dinga an pêthmangsan lei le A lampuihai chu pakhat khawm an ngaisak naw leiin.
28,"So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.","Chuongchun, mi rimsi khêk ri chu ama kuom an intlungtir a, Chun, ama chun sukrimsia um khêk ri chu a lo hriet a."
29,"When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man:","To ṭawk ṭawka a um laiin, tuin am dem thei an ta? Chun, a hmai a thup lai chun tuin am ama chu hmu thei an ta? Hnam pumpui chunga thaw amanih mi pakhat chunga thaw amani khawm ni sien, angkhat a nih."
30,"That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.","Pathien ngaisak naw mi chun ro rêl naw sien chu, Mihai chu a âwk ding tukhawm um naw ni hai."
31,"For hath any said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:","Mi tukhawma Pathien kuomah an ti ta hlak am, ‘Thununna chu ka tuor tah a, suklungsen nâwk ta ngai dêr naw ning;"
32,"That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?","Ka hmu nawhai chu nangin mîn chûktir la, Suolna lo thaw tah ka ni chun, thaw ta ngai naw ning,’ tiin."
33,"Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest.","A thungna chu i nuom angtak chu a ni ding maw, nang chun i kal vei a? Nang chun i thlang ding a nih, kei ni loin; Chuleiin, i hriet chu hril rawh."
34,"Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:","Mi, hrietthiemna nei mihai chun ka kuoma hieng hin tîng an ta, Anih, mi var tinhai kei mi lo ngai hlakhai chun;"
35,"Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.","‘Job chun hrietna nei loin thu a hril a. A thuhai chu varna bo a nih,’ tiin."
36,"Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.","Job chu a tâwp chena fie ni sienla aw, Mi rilohai anga a dawnna leiin."
37,"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.","A suolnaa chun helna chu a belsaa, Eini lai hin a kuthai a ben a, A thuhai chu Pathien chunga chun a sukpung tah a,” tiin."
