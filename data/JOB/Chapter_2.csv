1,"Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.","Ni khat chu Pathien naupahai chu LALPA hmaa an hung inlang- na ni a um nâwk a, Setan khawm chu anni laia LALPA hmaa inlang dingin a hung veh a."
2,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Nang khâwtienga inthawka hung am i na?” a ta. Setan chun LALPA chu a dawn a, “Hnuoia kân vâk vêlnaa le chutaka a suk a tunga inlawnnaa inthawkin,” a ta."
3,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.","LALPA chun Setan kuoma chun, “Ka siehlaw Job hi i ngaituo hlak am? Hnuoi chunga hin ama anga mi fel le mi tluong, Pathien ṭi mi le suol nghat- san mi an um si nawh a; a san nei loa ama sukbohmang dinga a chungah i mîn chângtir khawma ama chun a ringumna chu a chel det tlat a nih,” a tih a."
4,"And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.","Setan chun LALPA chu a dawn a, “Vun aiah vun; anih, miin a thil nei po po chu a hringna dingin a pêk phal âwm hrim a nih."
5,"But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.","Tuhin i kut inlet la, a ru le taksa chu tâwk la, i hmâisanah hrilse ngei ngei a ti che,” a ta."
6,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.","LALPA chun Setan kuomah, “Ngai ta, ama chu i kuta um a nih annâwm; a hringna chau chu hla la,” a ta."
7,"So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.","Chuongchun, Setan chu LALPA hmâihmaa inthawk chun a fe suok tah a, Job chu a kephaa inthawka a lusîp chenin khuoihli pânnain a hrem tah a."
8,And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.,Ama chun ama le ama ân huotna dingin bekawihâr a lâk a; vut lai chun a ṭhung tah a.
9,"Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.","Chun, a nuhmei chun a kuomah, “I ringumna chu i la chel det tlat el a ni maw? Pathien chu hrilse la, thi el rawh,” a ta."
10,"But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a kuomah, “Nuhmei invêt thuhril angin thu i hril a nih. Iengdingin am Pathien kuta inthawka thil ṭha ei hmu chun, thil ṭha naw khawm ei hmu naw ding am a nih?” a ta. Hieng thilhai po poa khawm hin Job chun a hmûrhai khawmin thil a suksuol nawh a."
11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.","Chuongchun, Job ruol pathum hai chun ama chunga thil ṭha naw tlunghai po po chu an lo hriet chun, an hmun senga inthawk chun an rêngin an hung seng a; Eliphaz Teman mi le, Bildad Suhi mi le Zophar Naamath mi an nih; ama chu thlamuon ding le tuorpui dinga hung dingin hun rem an ruot tlâng a."
12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.","Chuongchun, râl hlataka in- thawka an mithai an hei inlên chun, ama chu an hriet nawh a, an khêk rak rak a, an ṭap tâwl tah a; an puonhai chu an keithlêr tâwl a, pilvut vân- vawrin an luhai an inthêkhum a."
13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.","Chuongchun, ama kuoma chun hnuoi chungah ni sari le zân sari an ṭhung a, a tu khawm chun a kuomah iengkhawm an hril nawh a; a lung- ngaina chu a nasa êm êm a nih ti an hmu sih a."
