1,"But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.","“Nisienlakhawm, tuhin ka nêka naupang lemhai khawm chun nuizabûrah an mi nei a; An pahai ka ran ruol uihai vêng dinga ka nuiêuhai khan,"
2,"Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished.","Anih, an kut thahrâthai chun a ieng chun am mi sukhlâwk a ta? Mi an vânglai hun fe liem ta hi."
3,"They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.","Tlâksamna le ṭâmna leiin an inrieng a, Râusanna le sietna hmun thim thlalêr ram chu an tlân a."
4,They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And the roots of the broom are their food.,"Hna rimtui hnabuk le, Luong zunghai chu an bu dingin an lâk a."
5,They are driven forth from the midst of men; They cry after them as after a thief;,"Mihriem laia inthawka hnawt hmangin an um a, Inru rau ang elin an hnunga chun an rau a."
6,"So that they dwell in frightful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.","Ruom chadan kârahai le, Hnuoi kuoahai le lungpui pûkahai um dingin."
7,Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together.,"Hlobuk lai chun an khêk a, Zakthlai buk hnuoia chun an um khâwm a."
8,"They are children of fools, yea, children of base men; They were scourged out of the land.","Invêt nauhai an nih, anih, mi hmangnabohai nauhai an na; Rama inthawk hnawt suok an nih."
9,"And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them.","“Tuhin annihai hla chu ka lo ni ta hi; Anih, anni ta dingin ṭawngnaa hmang ka lo ni tah."
10,"They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, And spare not to spit in my face.","An mi pâwlser a, keimaa inthawka hlatakah an ngîr a, Ka hmaia chil mi sâk khum khawm an ma nawh."
11,"For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me.","Ka thalhrui chu a sût a, a mi sukrinum ta leiin, Ka hmaa chun thîrse chu an pei thlâk a."
12,"Upon my right hand rise the rabble; They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.",Ka changtieng panga chun mi dukdaklo chu a tho a. Ka kehai chu ân tâwlhmang a; Ka chunga chun an bohmangna lampuihai chu an inchuon tah a.
13,"They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, Even men that have no helper.","Ka lampui chu nasatakin an suksiet a, Ka lungngaina chu hma an insâwntir a, Anni chu tukhawmin an khap nawh."
14,As through a wide breach they come: In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.,"Tui inṭhe huk ang elin an hung a, Suksietna laia chun keia chungah an intêl a."
15,Terrors are turned upon me; They chase mine honor as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.,"Ṭitnahai chu ka chungah a hung tlung a, Ka miṭhatna chu thli ang elin an hnawt a, Ka vângneina hlak chu sûm angin a fe liem tah a."
16,And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.,Tuhin ka lungril chu keia sûnga hin bunthlâkin a um a; Rimsikna nihai chu ka chungah a tlung chie ta a ni hi.
17,"In the night season my bones are pierced in me, And the pains that gnaw me take no rest.","Zân huna chun ka ruhai hin an mi chip an mi chip a, Chuong natna mi chip mi chiphai chu an ma ngai nawh."
18,By God’s great force is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.,"Ka natna hrâtna nasatak lei chun ka silfên chu a hmêlhem zo a, Ka zakaw rîng angin a mi khuop ta lem a."
19,"He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.","Dûmchirhaka chun a mi the lût a, Vut le pilvut ang el ka ni tah a ni hi."
20,"I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou gazest at me.","I kuomah ka hung khêk a, nang hlaka i mi dawn nawh a, Ka ngîr a, nangin i mi en nawh a."
21,Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.,"Ka chunga nunse dingin în chang tah a, I kut hrâtna chun i mi hrem a ni ta hi."
22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it; And thou dissolvest me in the storm.","Nang chun thlia chun i mi dawmkâng a, a chunga chun i mîn chuongtir a, Thlipuia chun i mi suktui tah a."
23,"For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living.","Nang chun thina le, Mi hring po po ta dinga in ruota chun mi ṭhuoi i tih ti ka hriet sih a."
24,Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?,"“Sietna nasatak tuortu chun a kut phar suokin, A sietna chunga chun ṭhangpuina ngaiin a khêk naw ding am a nih?"
25,Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?,Mi buoina tâwk ta ding chun ka ṭap hlak a ni naw am a nih? Mi tlasam ta ding khawm chun ka lungril ân rim hlak a ni naw am a nih?
26,"When I looked for good, then evil came; And when I waited for light, there came darkness.","Thil ṭha ka zawng laiin, thil ṭha naw a hung tlung a; Var ka nghâk zing laiin, inthimna a hung tlung bawk a."
27,"My heart is troubled, and resteth not; Days of affliction are come upon me.","Ka lung ân phu hlawp hlawp a, a châwl nawh a; Rimsikna nihai chu ka chungah a hung tlung a ni ta hi."
28,"I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.","Nisa ni si loa em dukin ka um a; Inkhâwmna lai chun ka ngîr dawk a, ṭhangpuina ngaiin ka khêk a."
29,"I am a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.","Sihalhai ta dinga unaupa ka lo na, Ostrikhai ta dinga ruolpa leh."
30,"My skin is black, and falleth from me, And my bones are burned with heat.","Ka vun chu a hung dum a, keimaa inthawkin ân khawk a; Ka ruhai chu lumin a kâng bawk a."
31,"Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.","Chuleiin, ka ṭingṭang chu sûnnaah ân chang a, Ka theihle chu mi ṭaphai râwlah ân chang bawk a."
