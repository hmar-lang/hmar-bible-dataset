1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said,","Elihu chun a zawm pei a, a hril a:"
2,"Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on God’s behalf.","“Mi lo daw hrâm la, inentir ka ti che; Pathien hmingin hril ding ṭhenkhat ka nei sih a."
3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.","Hlataka inthawkin ka hrietna hung lâng ka ta, Felna chu keia mi Siemtu kuomah inentir ka tih."
4,For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.,"Indiktakin, ka thuhai hi ân khêl si nawh a; Mi hrietna famkim nei chu i kuomah a um a nih."
5,"Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.","Ngai ta, Pathien chu thilthawthei a na, tukhawm a hmusit ngai nawh a, Hrietna hrâtnaa thilthawthei a nih."
6,"He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted their right.","Mi rilo hringna chu a hla nawh a; Amiruokchu, sukrimsia umhai kuoma chun an thuneina chu a pêk a nih."
7,"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.","Mi fela inthawk chun a mithai a lâk kîr ngai nawh a, Amiruokchu, lalṭhungphaah lalhai leh an um a; Kumkhuoin anni chu a tungding a, chawimawi an ni hlak."
8,"And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of affliction;","Kawlhai inbuntira an um a, Sukrinumna hruihaia kei an ni chun;"
9,"Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.","An sinthaw le an bawsietnahai le, Chapotakin an lo khawsak tâkzie ân entir hlak."
10,"He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.","Inchûktirna tieng chun an na chu a sukvarpêk a, Suolnaa inthawka kîr dingin thu a pêk hlak."
11,"If they hearken and serve him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.","Chu chu an ngai a, ama rawng an bâwl chun, an nihai chu hausaknain hmang zo an ta, An kumhai chu nuomsipnain."
12,"But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.","Amiruokchu, an ngâi naw chun, kâwlhnâmin bohmang an ta, Hrietna boin thîng an tih."
13,But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them.,"Nisienlakhawm, chuong lungrila Pathien ngaisak nawhai chun lunginsenna an khâwlkhâwm a, Anni a khuop pha khawm ṭhangpuina ngênin an khêk nawh."
14,"They die in youth, And their life perisheth among the unclean.","Vânglaiin an thih a, An hringna chu mi dukdaklohai lai a bohmang tah a."
15,"He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression.","Sukrimsia umhai chu a sukrimsiknain a sanhim a, Nêksâwrnain an nahai chu a sukvar tah a."
16,"Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.","Anih, rimsiknaa inthawk chun nang chu ṭhuoi hmang a ti cheh a, Inchêpna umlo, hmun lientaka chun; Chun, i dawkâna siea um chu thâunain sip tâng a tih."
17,But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold on thee.,"Amiruokchu, nang chu mi rilo rorêla sip i ni tah a, Rorêlna le indikna chu nangmaa chun ân phun tah a nih."
18,For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.,"Lunginsenna a um leiin, indittâwkna chun ṭhuoi hmang hlau a che, fîmkhur rawh; Intlanna nasatak chun nang chu hnâwlhmang bâwk naw raw se che."
19,"Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress, Or all the forces of thy strength?","Rimsia i um nawna dingin i hausaknahai chu a huntâwk am a nih? Annawleh, i thahrui hrâtnahai po po chu a hun am a nih?"
20,"Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.","Zân chu dit naw la, Chu huna chun mihai chu an hmuna sât thlâk an ni hlak."
21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.","Fîmkhur la, suolna chu ngaisak naw, Sukrimsia umna nêkin hi hi i thlang ta sih a."
22,"Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him?","Ngai ta, Pathien chun a thilthawtheinain insângtakin a thawh a, Ama ang inchûktirtu tu am an um a?"
23,"Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?","Tuin am a lampui a ruotpêk thei a? Annawleh, ‘Thil fel lo i thaw a nih,’ tuin am ti thei a ta?"
24,"Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung.","“A sinthaw chawimawi hlak ding chu hre zing la, Mihai khawma hlaa an inpâk hlak chu."
25,All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.,"Mihai po po chun chu chu an en a, Mi chun hlataka inthawkin a hmuh a."
26,"Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable.","Ngai ta, Pathien chu a ropui a, ama chu ei hriet naw a nih; A kum tamzie khawm chu zawng suok ruollo a nih."
27,"For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor,","Tui farhai chu chungtieng a lâk kâng a; Chuong chu, a tuihua inthawk chun ruoah an far thla sih a."
28,Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly.,"Chuongchun, vânhai chun a hung bunthlâk a; Mi chunga chun tamtakin ân sûrtir a."
29,"Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?","Anih, mi tu bêkin amanih sûmhai inzar ziehai hi hre thei a ti, A biekbûk vâninrûmhai chu?"
30,"Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea.","Ngai ta, ama vêla chun a var chu a phar a; Tuisuoriet limawng chu ân khum tah a."
31,For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.,"Hieng thilhai hin mipuihai ro chu a rêl sih a, Ama chun fâk ding tamtakin a pêk a."
32,"He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.","A kuthai chu kâwlinlepin ân khum a, A tumna tak fu dingin thu a pêk a."
33,"The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.","A vâninrûm chun thlipui hung chu a hril a, Ran ruol chen khawmin thlipui hung thu chu an hril a."
