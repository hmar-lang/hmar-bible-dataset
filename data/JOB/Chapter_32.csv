verse_no,en,hmr
1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.","Chuongchun, hi mi pathum hai hin Job an dawnna chu an tâwp tah a, ama mithmua chun a fel tlat si leiin."
2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.","Ram hnama mi Buz mi Barakel naupa Elihu lung chu a sen tah a; a lunginsenna chu Job chungah a nih a hung sat chu, ama le ama chu Pathien nêka thiem ân changtir tlat leiin."
3,"Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.","A ruolhai pathum chunga khawm a lunginsenna chu a hung sa bawk a, dawnna ding hmu suok si loin, Job chu thiemnaw an inchangtir si leiin."
4,"Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.","Tuhin Elihu chun Job kuoma thuhril ding chu a nghâk a, ama nêka anni chu an upa lem leiin."
5,"And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.","Chun, Elihu chun chuong mi pathum hai baua inthawk chun dawnna hrim a um naw ti a hmu chun a lunginsenna chu a hung zuol tah a."
6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.","Chun, Elihu Buz mi Barakel naupa chun a dawn a, a hril tah a: “Kei naupang ka na, nangni chu upatak in na; Chuleiin, kân sûm a, ka ngaidân chu in kuomah kân entir ngam naw cheu a nih."
7,"I said, Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.","‘Nihai chun hung hril a ta, Kumhai tamna chun varna inchûktir naw nîm,’ ka lo ta."
8,"But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.","Amiruokchu, mihriema chun thlarau a um a, Iengkimthawthei chun a thuokin anni chu hrietthiemna a pêk a ni lem a."
9,"It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that understand justice.","Mi ropuihai chu an var chuong kher nawh a, Mi upahai chun thudik chu an hrietthiem vawng kher bîk nawh."
10,"Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show mine opinion.","Chuleiin, ‘Kei mi ngai unla, Kei khawma ka ngaidân inhriettir ka tih’, ka ti a nih."
11,"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, Whilst ye searched out what to say.","“Ngai ta u, in thuhai chu ka nghâk zing a, In thuhril sanhai ka lo ngai zing a, Ieng am hril ding tia in zawng sûng po khan."
12,"Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you.","Anih, in kuomah ka um zing a. Chun, ngai ta u, nangni lai tukhawm Job thuhne hrim hrim in um dêr nawh a. Annawleh, nangni lai a thuhai dawn thei hrim in um dêr naw a nih."
13,"Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:","‘Varna kan hmu suok tah, Mihriem ni loin, Pathien chun a namhnuoi a nih’, ti hlau rawi in tih."
14,For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches.,"A thuhai chu keima kal zâwngin ân kâwltir nawh a, In thuhrilhai angin kei khawmin ama chu dawn bawk naw ning."
15,"They are amazed, they answer no more: They have not a word to say.","Anni chun mak an ti tah a, an dawn ta hrim hrim nawh a, Thu bau khat khawm hril ding hrim an nei ta nawh a."
16,"And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?","Thu an hril ta naw leiin, An ngîr ṭawk ṭawk a, an dawn ta hrim hrim naw leiin, ka nghâk ding maw?"
17,"I also will answer my part, I also will show mine opinion.","Kei khawma ka chana chun dawn vêng ka ta, Kei khawma ka ngaidân chu inentir vêng ka tih."
18,For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me.,Thuhaiin ka sip sih a; Ka sûnga thlarau hin a mi tirlui a nih.
19,"Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.","Ngai ta u, ka sûng chu uoin hu suokna nei lo ang chu a nih; Peng tharhai puokkawi ṭêp ding ang chu."
20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.","Ka sâwl a dam huoina dingin thu hril ka ta, Ka bau kain dawn ka tih."
21,"Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.","Ka hni cheu hi, mi tukhawm mi nina chu mîn zâtir naw unla, Mi tukhawm kuomah hming ṭha tehlêm chu pe bawk naw ning."
22,For I know not to give flattering titles; Else would my Maker soon take me away.,"Inpâk tehlêm chu ka thiem si nawh a, Chuong naw chun, kei mi Siemtu hin mi la hmang vak rawi a tih."
