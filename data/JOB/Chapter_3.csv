1,"After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.","Chu hnunga chun Job chun a bau a kah a, a pieng ni chu ṭawngsie ân phur tah a."
2,And Job answered and said:,"Chun, Job chun a hril tah a:"
3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.","“Ni, ka piengna ni chu bohmang sienla, ‘Naupasal pâi a nih ie,’ titu zân le chun."
4,"Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.","Chu ni chu sukthimin um sienla, Chungtienga inthawkin Pathien khawmin ngaisak naw sienla; A chungah var khawm var bawk naw raw se."
5,Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.,"Inthimna le thina hlim chun anni ta ngeiah hau sienla, A chungah sûm zîng tlat raw se; Ni inthimna chun suklâu raw hai se."
6,"As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.","Chu zân chu inthim sâmupin man sienla, Chu kum sûng nihaia chun hlimna hrim hrim um naw sienla; Thla nizât tiemnaa khawm ṭhang ve naw raw se."
7,"Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein.","Anih, chu zân chu zân dawkdâium ni sienla, Chu zâna chun hlim râwl hrim hrim um naw raw se."
8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.","Ni ṭawngsie inphurtuhai chun ṭawngsie inphur raw se, Leviathan sukhar dân thiemhai chun."
9,"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:","A sîkhawvar chu inthim sienla, Var zawng sienla, hmu bawk naw sienla; Zîngkâr khawfingchat khawm hmu bawk naw raw se."
10,"Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.","Ka nu sula kawtkhârhai chu a lo khâr nawh a, Ka mithaia inthawkin buoina chu a thup naw bawk leiin."
11,Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?,Sula chun iengdinga ka lo thi naw am a na? Phîng sûnga inthawka ka hung suokin iengdinga thlarau chu lo inthla el naw am ka na?
12,"Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck?",Khûphai chun iengdinga an mi lo dawm am a na? Nênehai chun ka nêk ding elin iengdinga an mi lo pawm am a na?
13,"For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,","Tuhin zâlin to riem riem tâng ka ta, In ka ta, sâwldamin ka um ta ding bah:"
14,"With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;","Hi hnuoia lalhai le rorêltuhai, Anni ta dinga hmun sehai siemtuhai le chun;"
15,"Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:","Annawleh, lal nau rângkachak neituhai, An inhai tangkaruoa suksiptuhai le chun."
16,"Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.","Annawleh, pieng hun loa thupa um ang ka ni ta ding, Nautê, var hrim hrim hmu ngailohai ang hi."
17,There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.,"Chutaka chun mi rilo chun a sukbuoina chu ma tâng a ta, Chutaka chun rimsi chu sâwldam tâng a tih."
18,There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.,Chutaka chun lung in intânghai chu um khâwm dingin an zalên a; Sin inthâwtirtu râwlri khawm an hriet ta ngai nawh.
19,The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master.,Mi lien le mi chîn khawm chutaka chun an um khâwm a; Siehlaw khawm chu a hotua inthawk inthla a ni tah.
20,"Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;","Iengdinga mi, rimsitaka um kuoma chun var pêk a nih a, Lungrila rimsi tuor kuoma chun hringna pêk am a nih a?"
21,"Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;","Thi inhâwk êm êma thi thei si lo a, Ro phûm zawng nêk hmana zawng nasa a,"
22,"Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave?","Thlân chu a hmu suok thei pha a, Nasataka hlim êm êm ding kuoma chun?"
23,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?","Iengdinga mi, a lampui thupa um kuoma le, Pathienin paldâi ân huonkhum kuoma chun var pêk am a na?"
24,"For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.","Ka bufâk hmain ka thuokdawngna chu a hung tlung a, Kân rûmnahai chu tui anga bunthlâk an ni hlak sih a."
25,"For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.","Thil ka iṭi tak chu ka chungah a hung tlung hlak a, Ka înlâu tak chu ka kuomah a hung tlung hlak."
26,"I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.","Inhawiin ka um nawh a, ka to ṭawk ṭawk thei nawh a, Sâwldam ka nei bawk nawh a; buoina a hung tlung lem hlak,” tiin."
