1,"Then Job answered and said,","Chun, Job chun a dawn a, a hril tah a,"
2,Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning.,“Vawisûn ngei khawm hin ka chierna chu a kha a nih. Kân rûm zing khawmin a kut chu a rik hleh a.
3,Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!,"Aw, ama chu ka hmusuok theina hmun chu hre lang chu, A ṭhungphaa ngei chun ka fe thei ding bah!"
4,"I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments.","A hmaa chun ka chungthu chu intlun ka ta, Ka bau chu insêlnain suksip ka tih."
5,"I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me.","Thu a mi dawnnahai chu hrieng ka ta, Keia kuoma a hrilhai khawm chu hrethiem ka tih."
6,Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.,"A thilthawtheina ropui le chun a mi kal ding am a nih? Kal lo e, kei chu mi ngaisak lem a tih."
7,There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.,"Chutaka chun mi tluong chun ama le chun ngaituo thei an ta, Chuongchun, ka rorêltua inthawkin kumkhuoin suok tâng ka tih."
8,"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;","Ngai ta u, hmatieng ka feh a, nisienlakhawm, chutaka chun ama a um nawh a. Chun, hnungtieng ka feh a, nisienlakhawm, ama ka hmu thei si nawh a."
9,"On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.","Vawitiengah, sin a thaw lai chun, nisienlakhawm, ama ka hmu thei si nawh, Changtienga chun ama chu a lo inbi zing a, ka hmu thei naw a nih."
10,"But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.","Amiruokchu, ama chun lampui ka hraw chu a hriet a, Amain a mi fie pha chun, rângkachak angin hung suok ka tih."
11,"My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside.","Ka ke chun a kehnunghai chu a zui tlat a, A lampui chu ka zui a, ka fe pêt ngai nawh."
12,I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.,"A hmûrhaia inthawka thupêkhaia inthawk chun ka fe pêt ngai nawh a, Ka fâk ding pawimaw nêka nasa lemin a baua thuhai chu ka sie khâwl lem a."
13,"But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu ngaituona thleng lo a na, tuin am ama chu herhmang thei a ta? A lungrilin a nuomtak chu, chu ngei chu a thaw hlak."
14,For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him.,"Thil keia ta dinga ruothai chu a thaw sih a, Chuong ang thil tamtak chu ama kuomah a um a nih."
15,"Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.","Chuleiin, a hmaihmaa chun ka buoi hlak a; Ka ngaituo châng chun, ama chu ka ṭi hlak."
16,"For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me;","Pathien chun ka lungril chu a sukchâuin, Iengkimthawthei chun a mi sukbuoi hlak."
17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.","Inthimna chun a mîn huolvêl a, Inthim sâmup chun ka hmai ân khum si a."
