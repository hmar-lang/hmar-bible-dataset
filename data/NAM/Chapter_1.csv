14,"And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.","LALPA chun i chungchâng thuah thu a pêk a, i hming chu chi anga thê ni ta naw nih; i pathien ina inthawka milim siemfâwm le milim sunghai chu sukbohmang ka tih; i thlân chu siem ka tih, i suol sih a,” tiin."
15,"Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.","Tlânghaia chanchin ṭha in- tluna, inremna thu tlânginsampui- tuhai ke chu en ta! Aw Juda, i ruoi- ṭhenahai chu inser la, i thutiemhai chu sukpuitling rawh; mi rilo chun a pal thleng nâwk ta âwm si naw cheh a, sukbohmang dêr a ni tah a nih."
