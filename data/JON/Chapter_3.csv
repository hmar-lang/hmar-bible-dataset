1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jona kuoma chun a hung tlung nawn nâwk a:"
2,"Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.","“Tho la, Ninevi khuo, khaw ropuitaka chun fe la, thu hril ding ka tuk che hi va tlânginsampui rawh,” tiin."
3,"So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey.","Chuongchun, Jona chu a tho a, LALPA thu ang chun Ninevi khuoa chun a fe tah a. Ninevi khuo chu khawpui ropuitak el, ni thum lam tling a nih."
4,"And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.","Jona chu ni khat lam chen khaw- puia chun a hang lût ṭan phawt a, “Tuta inthawka ni sâwmliah Ninevi hi sukbohmang a ni ding a nih,” tiin a khêk tah a."
5,"And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.","Ninevi mihai chun Pathien an ring tah a; bunghei ding tiin an puong a, anni laia a lien taka inthawka a chîn tak chenin saiip puon an sil tah a."
6,"And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.","Chuong thu chu Ninevi khaw laltak nahrietah a hung tlung tah a, a lalṭhungphaa inthawk chun a tho a, a lal puon chu a hlîp thlâk a, saiip puon a sil a, vut lai a ṭhung tah a."
7,"And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;","Laltak le a mi lienhai thupêkin laltak chun Ninevi khaw sûnga chun thu a puongin ân suo tah a, “Mihriem amanih, ran amanih, bâwng ruol amanih, berâm ruol amani khawm chun iengkhawm intem naw raw se; fain tui khawm dâwn naw raw se;"
8,"but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.","mihriem le ranhai chun saiip puon sil lem hai sienla, nasatakin Pathien ko raw hai se, anih, mi tinin mâni lampui ṭha naw le, an kuta inpâwngnêkna chu nghatsan raw hai se."
9,"Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?","Ei bohmang nawna dingin, Pathien chu kîrin, lungril inlêtin, a lunginsenna nasataka inthawk chun inlêt naw ni ti tuin am a hriet a?” tiin."
10,"And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.","Chuongchun, Pathienin an thilthawhai chu enin, an lampui ṭha naw chu an nghatsan ti a hmu a, an kuoma a hril tah thaw a tum thil ṭha naw chu, Pathien chun ân lêt a; a thaw ta nawh a."
