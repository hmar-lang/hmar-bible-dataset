1,"Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,",Amittai naupa Jona kuomah LALPA thu a hung tlung a:
2,"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.","“Tho la, Ninevi khuo, khawpui ropuitaka chun fe la, a chunga thu tlânginsampui rawh; an rîtlona chu ka hmaah a hung tlung ta sih a,” tiin."
3,"But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.","Nisienlakhawm, Jona chu LALPA hmaa inthawka Tarsis-a tlân hmang dingin a tho tah a; chun, Joppa khuoah a zuk feh a, Tarsis khaw pan ding lawng a hmuh a, chuongchun, a chuong man ding chu a pêk a, LALPA hmaa inthawk chun Tarsis pan dinghai le fe dingin lawnga chun a lût thla ve tah a."
4,"But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun thli natak el tuisuorieta chun ân hrângtir a, tuisuorieta chun thlipui nasatak el chu a hrâng tah a; chuongchun, lawng chu kawi ding ang elin a um tah a."
5,"Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.","Chun, lawng mihai chun an ṭih a, mâni pathien an ko seng a; lawng chu an ta dinga a zângna dingin lawng sûnga thuomhnawhai chu tuisuorieta chun an pei suok tah a, Jona ruok chu lawng sûngril taka chun a lo lût tah a, a lo zâl a, a lo ininnghil dêr tah a."
6,"So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.","Chuongchun, lawng hotu chu a kuoma chun a hung a, “Aw nang a inpa, iengtizie am a na? Tho la, i Pathien ko rawh, Pathien chun, ei bohmang nawna dingin a mi ngaituo rawi mawh,” a ta."
7,"And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.","Chun, “Hung ta u, hi thil ṭha naw ei chunga hung tlung hi tu lei am a na ti ei hriet theina dingin, ai sân ei tiu,” tiin an inbiek tâwl a. Chuongchun, ai chu an sân a, aisân chu Jona chunga chun a tlu tah a."
8,"Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?","Chun, a kuoma chun, “Hi thil ṭha naw ei chunga um hi tu lei am a nih mi hril rawh, kan ngên che hi? I sinthaw ieng am a na? Khâwlaia inthawka hung am i nih a? Khâw tieng ram mi am i na, khâwlai ieng hnam am i na?” an tih a."
9,"And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hebrai mi ka na, tuisuoriet le khawmuol siemtu LALPA, vân Pathien chu ka ṭi a nih,” a ta."
10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.","Chun, mihai chun an ṭi nasa ta êm êm a, a kuoma chun, “Sei le, ieng am i lo thaw an leh?” an tih a; a hril ta lei chun mihai chun LALPA hmaa inthawkin a tlân hmang a nih ti an hriet tah a."
11,"Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.","Chuongchun, a kuoma chun, “Ei ta dinga tuisuoriet hi a fâwn nawna dingin i chungah ieng am kan thaw ding?” an tih a, tuisuoriet chu a fâwn nasa deu deu el sih a."
12,"And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Mi pawm kâng unla tuisuorieta hin mi the lût el ro; chuongchun, tuisuoriet hi in ta dingin fâwn ta naw ni hai; keima leiin hi thlipui nasatak el hi in chungah a hrâng a nih ti ka hriet sih a,” a ta."
13,Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.,"Nisienlakhawm, mihai chun khawmuola kîr dingin an kar rak rak a, amiruokchu, an thei nawh a, tuisuoriet hlak chu an chungah a fâwn nasa deu deu el sih a."
14,"Wherefore they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee.","Chuleichun, LALPA chu an ko a, “Aw LALPA, hi mipa hringna lei hin mi sukbohmang naw la, mithiem thisen maw chu kan chunga innghat lul lo dingin kan ngên che, Aw LALPA, kan ngên che, nangin i nuom anga i thaw a ni sih a,” an tih a."
15,"So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.","Chuongchun, Jona chu an pawm kâng a, tuisuorieta chun an the lût tah a; chun, tuisuoriet chu a fâwn so bur bur chu a re tah a."
16,"Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows.","Chuongchun, mihai chun LALPA chu nasatakin an ṭi tah a; LALPA kuoma chun inthawina an inhlân a, thu dâm an tiem tah a."
17,And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.,"Chun, LALPA chun Jona lem dingin nga lientak a lo ruot tah a; chu nga sûnga chun Jona chu ni thum le zân thum a um a."
