1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.","Amiruokchu, chu thil chun Jona chu a suklungni ta naw êm êm a, a lunginsen a,"
2,"And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, I pray thee, O Jehovah, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repentest thee of the evil.","LALPA kuoma chun a ṭawngṭai a, “Aw LALPA, ka ngên che, hi hi ni lo am a ni kan rama ka um laia ka hril kha? Hi lei hin Tarsis tieng khan ka tlân hmang a ni kha, nang chu lunginsietna hau, thil ṭha nawa inthawka inlêt nâwk hlak i ni ti ka hriet a."
3,"Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.","Chuleichun, Aw LALPA, tuhin ka hringna hi mi lâkpêk el dingin ka ngên che; keia ta ding chun dam nêkin thi a ṭha lem sih a,” a ta."
4,"And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?","LALPA chun, “I lunginsen hi i thaw dik am a ni ding chu?” a ta."
5,"Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.","Chuongchun, Jona chu khawpuia inthawk chun a fe suok a, khawpui saktieng panga chun a ṭhung a, chutaka chun sâwlbûk a bâwl a, khawpui chunga thil hung tlung ding chu hmu tumin a hnuoi inhlima chun a ṭhung ta zing a."
6,"And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun ûm a lo ruot a, chu chu Jona chunga chun ân zâmtir a, a rinumnaa inthawka sansuok dinga a lu zâr hlietu dingin. Chuongchun, Jona chu ûm lei chun nasatakin a lâwm tah a."
7,"But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.","Amiruokchu, Pathienin a zînga chun khawfingchat laiin, thilnge a ruot a, chu chun ûm chu a rêt a, a hung vuoi tah a."
8,"And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.","Chun, nisa a hung suok chun Pathienin khawsak thli lum a ruot a; nisa chun Jona lu chu a em a, a thidang a, a ta ding chun thi a hni tah a; “Keia ta dingin dam nêkin thi a ṭha lem,” a ti tah a."
9,"And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.","Pathien chun Jona kuomah, “Ûm chungchâng thua I lunginsen hi i thaw dik am a nih?” a ta. Ama chun, “Thi pha khawp hiela ka lunginsen hi ka thaw dik a nih,” a ta."
10,"And Jehovah said, Thou hast had regard for the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:","LALPA chun, “I în rimpui lo, I în ṭhangtir khawm ni lo, zân khat thila hung uma, zân khat thila bohmang nâwk ûm hi i lainat a;"
11,"and should not I have regard for Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?","Ninevi khuo, khaw ropuitak, a sûngah mi nuoi khat le sîng hni nêka tam, an changtieng le vawitieng khawm thlier thei lohai le ran ruol tamtak umna hi, ka lunginsiet naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
