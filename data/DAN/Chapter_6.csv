1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;","Daria chun, ram sûng po poa chun biel awptu za sâwmhni sie ding ti le"
2,"and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.","an chunga chun hotu pathum, a pakhat chu Daniel chu ni dingin ti chu ṭha a ti a; chun, hieng biel awp- tuhai hin anni kuoma chun sum sêng dân chanchin chu pêng an ta; chuong- chun, lal chun sietna a tuok nawna dingin."
3,"Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.","Chun, hi Daniel hi amaa chun lungvar ṭha bîk a um leiin biel awp- tuhai le an hotuhai nêk chun a danglam bîk rieu a; chuongchun, lal chun a ram po po chunga hotua siem a lungril a."
4,"Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.","Chun, hotuhai le biel awptuhai chun ram chungthuah Daniel chunga chun remchâng an zawng tah a; ni- sienlakhawm, ama chu ring a um a, amaa chun khawhlona le indiknawna hrim hmu a ni naw leiin khawhlona le remchâng chu an hmu thei dêr nawh a."
5,"Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.","Chun, chuong mihai chun, “A Pathien dân chung thuah ama kalna ei hmu ti ngawt naw chu, Daniel chunga hin remchâng ei hmu thei ngai âwm nawh,” an ta."
6,"Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.","Chun, hieng hotuhai le biel awptuhai hi lal kuoma chun an hung inkhâwm a, a kuomah, “Lal Daria, kumkhuoin dam rawh."
7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.","Hi rama hotuhai, ram awptuhai, biel awptuhai, sipai hotuhai le rorêl- tuhai po po kan inkhâwm a, aw lalpa, ni sâwmthum sûng chu nangma kuoma chau naw chu tukhawmin mi dang amanih, pathien amani kuoma hnina a siem hrim hrim chu, ama chu sakeibakneihai pûka pei lût ni raw se tia dân dettak siem dingin kan inbiekthlûk tah a nih."
8,"Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.","Tuhin, aw lalpa, chu dân chu sukdet la, Media le Persia mihai dâna sukdanglam a ni nâwk nawna dingin i hming ziek rawh,” an ta."
9,Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.,"Chuongchun, lal Daria chun chu lekhaziek le thupêka chun a hming a ziek tah a."
10,"And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem); and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.","Daniel chun chu lekhazieka chun hming ziek a ni tah ti a hriet phingleh a inah a fe tah a; (a pindana a tukverhai chu Jerusalem khuo tienga hawng zing a na) chun, a khûpin ni khatah vawi thum pei a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a Pathien hmaa chun, a hmaa a lo thaw rawp ta angin a ṭawngṭai a, lâwmthu a hril tah a."
11,"Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.","Chun, chuong mihai chu an inkhâwm a, Daniel chu a Pathien hmaa hnina siema ṭawngṭaiin an hmu tah a."
12,"Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.","Chun, an hung hnai a, lal hmaa chun lal thupêk chungchang thu chu an hril tah a; “Aw lalpa, nangma kuomah ti chau lo chu, ni sâwmthum sûng mi tukhawmin mi dang amani, pathien kuoma mani hnina siem chu sakeibakneihai pûka pei lût ding ti thupêka khan i hming i ziek an nâwm a nih?” an ta. Lal chun a dawn a, “Media mihai le Persia mihai dân sukdanglam thieng lo ang tak chun chu chu ân dik a nih,” a ta."
13,"Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.","Chun, an dawn a, lal kuoma chun, “Kha Daniel Juda ram mi salintângpa khan, aw lalpa, nang a pawisa naw cheh a, i thupêk i hming ziek khawm kha a pawisa nawh a, ni tin hnina vawi thum a siem zie a nih,” an ta."
14,"Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.","Chun, lal chun hieng thu hi a hriet phingleh nasatakin a lungni ta nawh a, ama sansuok dingin Daniel chunga chun a lungril chu a fu ta tlat a; ama sansuok ding chun nisa tlâk hmakhat chun nasatakin ân ngai- tuoh a."
15,"Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.","Chun, chuong mihai chu lal kuomah an hung inkhâwm a, lal kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, thupêk amanih, dân amanih lalin a siem ta chu sukdanglam thieng lo a nih ti hi Media le Persia mihai dân a nih ti hi hre rawh,” an ta."
16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.","Chun, lal chun thu a pêk a, Daniel chu an hung ṭhuoi a, sakei- bakneihai pûka chun an pei lût tah a. Lal chun a hril a, Daniel kuoma chun, “I Pathien a rawng i bâwl zing hlak chun sansuok a ti che,” a ta."
17,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.","Chun, lung chu an hung lâk a, a pûk baua chun an indel tah a; chuongchun, lal chun ama hming namna le a rorêltuhai hming namna chu Daniel chungchâng thua chun thil sukdanglam hrim hrim um lo dingin a nam tah a."
18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.","Chun, lal chu a lal ina chun a feh a, chu zân chu bungheiin a hmang zo tah a; a hmaa chun thil rimawihai hung lâkin a um ta nawh a, a imu chu amaa inthawkin a zâm hmang tah a."
19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.","Chun, lal chu zîngkâr inhma- takin a tho a, sakeibakneihai pûka chun inhmatakin a va fe tah a."
20,"And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?","Daniel kuomah, sakeibakneihai pûk kâwl chu a hung tlung hnai chun, ṭap râwlin a khêk a; lal chun Daniel kuoma chun, “Aw Daniel, Pathien hring siehlawpa, i Pathien a rawng i bâwl zing zing hlak chun sakeibak- neihaia inthawkin a sansuok thei che am a nih?” a ta."
21,"Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.","Daniel chun lal kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, kumkhuoin dam rawh."
22,"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.","Ka Pathien chun a vântirko a hungtir a, sakeibakneihai bau chu a hung sukchîp a, an mi sukna hrim hrim nawh; a hmaa chun keimaa indik nawna um lo chu hmuin a um a; aw lalpa nanga hmaa khawm ieng- khawm ka sukpawi nawh,” a ta."
23,"Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.","Chun, lal chu nasatakin a lâwm tah a, Daniel chu pûka inthawka la suok ding chun anni chu thu a pêk tah a, chuongchun, Daniel chu pûka inthawk chu lâk suokin a um a, ama chun Pathien chu a ring tlat leiin amaa chun suknatna iengkhawm hmuin a um nawh a."
24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.","Chun, lal chun thu a pêk a, chuong Daniel hêktuhai chu an hung ṭhuoi a; anni leh, an nauhai leh, an nuhmeihai le chun sakei- bakneihai pûka chun an pei tah a; anni chu sakeibakneihai chun an lo thaw tah a, an ruhai chu a nawi nawiin an suktliek vawng a, pûk ṭuong chu an tlung hman naw hiel lem a nih."
25,"Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.","Chun, lal Daria chun hnuoi chung po poa chêng mi po po le ṭawng tinrênghai kuoma chun lekha a ziek tah a, “In kuomah inremna sukpung- in um raw se."
26,"I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.","Thupêk chu ka siem a; ka ram leilunga mi po pohai chun Daniel Pathien chu ṭiin a hmaa chun inthin raw hai se. Ama chu Pathien hring, chatuona pângngai zing a ni sih a, A ram khawm chu suksiet ni ngai naw nih a, A rorêlna chu chatuonin um zing lem a tih."
27,"He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.","Ama chun a sansuokin a sanhim a, Hnuoi le vâna khawm thilmakhai le inchiknahai a thawh a, Ama chu sakeibakneihai thilthawtheinaa inthawka Daniel sanhimtu chu a nih,” tiin."
28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.","Chuongchun, Daniel chu Daria rorêl sûng le Persia mi Kura rorêl sûng po chu a hung hlawtling ta hleh a."
