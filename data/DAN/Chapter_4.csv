1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.","Lal Nebukadnezzar chun, Mi po po, hnam po po, ṭawng tinhai le hnuoi chunga chêng taphawthai kuoma chun, in kuomah inremna hi sukpungin um raw se."
2,It hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.,Pathien Chunghnungtakin ka kuomah inchiknahai le thilmakhai a thaw chu inentir hi ṭhain ka hriet a.
3,"How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.","Ân chiknahai chu a va ropui ngei de! A thilmakhai chun thil a va thaw thei ngei de! A ram chu chatuon ram a na, A rorêlna khawm chu ṭhanga inthawk ṭhang nâwksâwng chen a nih."
4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.","Kei Nebukadnezzar hi ka ina chun inhawitakin ka um a, ka lal ina chun chênghnâwngtakin ka um a."
5,I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.,"Mang mi sukṭi êm êm el chu ka hmuh a, ka khum chunga ka ngai- tuonahai le, ka lua ka thil hmu- lâwknahai chun a mi suklungzîng êm êm a."
6,"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.","Chuleichun, mang umzie chu an mi hrilfie theina dingin Babulon rama mi var po pohai hung ṭhuoi khâwm dingin thupêk ka siem tah a."
7,"Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.","Chun, mitvaidawithiemhai, ai- sânthiemhai, Kaldai mihai le vâng- hriltuhai chu an hung lût a: chun, an hmaa chun mang chu ka hril a; nisienlakhawm, a umzie chu an mîn hriettir thei nawh a."
8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, saying,","Amiruokchu, a tâwp taka chun ka hmaa chun Daniel chu a hung lût a, a hming chu ka pathien hming ang peiin Beltesazzar a nih; amaa chun pathien inthienghai thlarau chu a um a; chuongchun, a hmaa chun mang chu ka hril tah a;"
9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.","“Aw Beltesazzar, mitvaidawi- thiemhai hotu, pathien inthienghai thlarau chu nangmaa chun a um a, thurûk chun nang a sukbuoi ngai naw che ti ka hriet leiin, ka manga thil hmulâwkhai ka hmu ta le, a umzie chu mi hril rawh."
10,"Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great.","Ka khum chunga ka lua thil hmulâwkhai ka hmu chu hieng ang hi a nih; hnuoi lailung lai hin thing ka hmuh a, ka en zing a, ân sângzie chu a nasa hleh a."
11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.","Thing chu a hung inṭhang a, a hung lien a, ân sângzie chun vân a hung phâk a, ân hmu theina chun khawvêl po po tâwp chen a huop bawk a."
12,"The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.","A hnahai chu a mawiin a rahai chu a tam êm êm a, amaa chun mi po po ta dingin fâkding a um a; ramsahai chu a hnuoia chun an inzârhlieh a, chunglêng vatehai khawm chu a kâuhaia chun an chêng a, mi po po chu amaa châwmin an um a."
13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.","Ka khum chunga thil hmu- lâwkhai ka hmua chun, ngai ta, vâna inthawkin vêngtu le mi inthieng pakhat a hung thlah a."
14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.","Ama chu inringtakin a khêk a, ‘Thing kha phûr thlu unla, a kâuhai kha tan thla ro, a hnahai kha sâwi ṭil unla, a ra kha the dar bawk ro; a kâuhaia vatehai le, a hnuoia ram- sahai kha fe hmang raw hai seh."
15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:","Amiruokchu, a zunghai kûng- hmui kha chu rama hlobet innêm lai, thîr le dârsen hnânga khuopin hnuoia khan mâksan ro; chun, vâna inthawka daidaw chun sukhuin um sienla, a fâk chu ramsahai angin hnuoia hlobet ni sienla;"
16,"let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.","a lungril khawm chu mihriem lungrila inthawka sukdanglam ni sienla, a kuoma chun ramsahai lung- ril chu pêk ni raw se; chun, hun sarihai chu ama chungah bo raw se."
17,"The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men.","Hi thu sukthlûk hi vêngtuhai thupêk le, mi inthienghai thua phût: hringna nei taphawt chun Achung- hnungtak chun mihriemhai rama chun ro a rêl a, a nuomna kuoma chun a pêk a, mi inhnuoitakhai khawm a chunga chun a sie thei ti an hrietna dingin a nih,’ tiin."
18,"This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.","Hi mang hi kei Nebukadnezzar hin ka hmu tah a, Aw Beltesazzar, a umzie chu hrilfie rawh, ka ram sûnga mi varhai chun a umzie chu an mîn hriettir thei si nawh a: nisienla- khawm, nang chun i thei a nih; pathien inthienghai thlarau chu nangmaa chun a um sih a,” ka tih a."
19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries.","Chun, Daniel a hming dang Beltesazzar chun chawmkhat tak chu mak a ti hleh a, a ngaituonahai chun ama a sukbuoi vieu a. Lal chun a dawn a; “Beltesazzar, mang chun amanih, a umzie chun amanih suk- buoi naw raw se che.” a ta. Beltesaz- zar chun a dawn a. “Ka lalpa, mang chu nangma theidatuhai che ta ding a na, a umzie chu i hmêlmahai ta ding a nih."
20,"The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;","Chu thing i hmu, hung inṭhang a, hung lien a, ân sângzie chun vân hung tawng a, ân hmu theina chen chu hnuoi po po huop a,"
21,"whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation:","a hnahai chu mawi êm êm a, a râhai chu tam êm êm a, thil chi tin ta dinga fâk ding hung nih a, chu hnuoia chun ramhnuoia sahai chu an chêng a, a kauhaia chunglêng vatehaiin um- na an siemna thing chu,"
22,"it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.","Aw lalpa, nang i nih: i hung inṭhangin i hung hrât a, i ropuina chu a hung lien a, vân a hung tawng a, i ram hlak chu hnuoi tâwp chen a ni bawk sih a."
23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;","Chun, lalin vâna inthawka vêngtu le mi inthieng hung thlaa, Thing kha phûr thlu unla sukbo- hmang ro, amiruokchu, a zunghai kûnghmui ruok chu hnuoia hlobet innêm lai thîr le dârsen hnânga khuopin mâksan ro, vâna inthawka daidâw chun hu hlak sienla, a fâk ding khawm chu ramhnuoia ramsa- hai fâk ang chu ni raw se; ama chunga hun sarihai a fe liem hma- khat chun, ti thu an hung hril ruok hi chu,"
24,"this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:","a umzie chu hieng ang hi a nih: Aw lalpa, hi hi Achunghnungtak thu- pêk chu a nih, ka pu lal chunga hung tlung hi;"
25,"that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.","chuongchun, mihriem laia in- thawka hnawt hmang nîng i ta, i chêngna chu rama ramsahai lai nîng a tih; chun, bâwngchalhai anga hlo- bet infâktir nîng i ta, vâna inthawka dâidâw chun sukhu ni bawk i tih; chun, hun sarihai chu i chunga chun fe liem a tih; mihriemhai ram chunga hin Achunghnungtak chun ro a rêl a, a nuom nuom kuomah a pêk hlak ti i hriet hmakhat chu."
26,"And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.","Chun, thing zunghai kûnghmui hla dinga thu an pêk chungthua hin chu; i ram hi chu nangma ta ni zing a ta; chu hnunga chun vânhai chun ro an rêl ngei a nih ti hre tâng i tih."
27,"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.","Chuleiin, aw lalpa, ka thurâwn hi i kuoma chun pawmtlâka ngai ni raw se; i suolnahai chu felnain thleng la, i khawhlonahai chu mi rimsihai chunga lunginsietna inentir bawk rawh; i sukdik nawnahai hi sukdama a um ding chun chu,” a ta."
28,All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.,Hieng thil po po hi lal Nebu- kadnezzar chunga chun a hung tlung tah a.
29,At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.,Thla sâwm pahnihai tâwpa chun Babulon ram lal ina chun a feh a.
30,"The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?","Lal chun a hril a, “Hi hi Babulon ram ropuitak, ka thilthawtheina hrât nasatak chun, lal chêngna ding le, ka în lalna ropuina dinga ka siem chu a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
31,"While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee:","Lalin chuonga thu a hril lai zing chun, vâna inthawkin râwl a hung thlah a, “Aw lal Nebukadnezzar, nangma kuoma inthawkin ram chu ṭhe hmang a ni tah ti hi i kuomah hril a nih."
32,"and thou shalt be driven from men; and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.","Chun, mihriemhai laia in- thawka hnawt hmang nîng i ta, i chêngna ding chu rama ramsahai lai nîng a tih; bâwngchal anga hlobet infâktir nîng i ta; chun, hun sarihai chu i chungah fe liem a tih; mi- hriemhai ram chunga hin Achung- hnungtak chun ro a rêl a, a nuom nuom kuomah a pêk hlak ti i hriet hmakhat chun,” a hung tih a."
33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.","Chu dâr ngeia chun chuong thil chu Nebukadnezzar chunga chun intlungtir a ni tah a, mihriem laia inthawka hnawt hmangin a um a, bâwngchal angin hlobet a pet a, a taksa chu vâna inthawka dâidâw chun a sukhuh a, a samhai chu mupui hmul ang el a hung nih a, a tinhai chu vatehai tin ang a hung ni chen chun."
34,"And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation;","Chuong nihai tâwpa chun, kei Nebukadnezzar hin ka mithai chu vântieng ka tang a, ka hrietna chu ka kuomah a hung kîr nâwk a, Achung- hnungtak chu mal ka sâwm a, cha- tuona hring zing chu ka chawimawiin kân pâk a: A rorêlna chu chatuon rorêl a na, A lalram chu ṭhanga inthawk ṭhang sâwng tamtak chen a ni sih a;"
35,"and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?","Hnuoi chung hluotuhai po po chu iengkhawm ni lo anga ngai an na, Hnuoi chung hluotuhai le vâna sipai pâwl ruolhai chunga chun A nuom ang angin a thawh a, Tukhawmin a kut chu an chel thei nawh a. “Nangin ieng am i thaw an leh?” an ti thei bawk nawh."
36,"At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.","Chu chu huna chun ka hriet- thiemna chu ka kuomah a hung kîr nâwk a; ka ram ropuina le ka înlalna le êngna chu ka kuomah an hung kîr nâwk sih a; chun, ka upahai le ka lalhai chun an mi zawng a; ka rama chun tungdingin ka um a, ropuina nasatak el chu ka kuomah belsain a um tah a."
37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.","Tuhin, kei Nebukadnezzar hin vâna Pathien chu ka chawimawiin, ka chawisângin kân pâk a; a sin- thawhai po po chu indikna a na, a lampuihai chu felna a nih; chun, chapoa fehai chu a sukhnuoi thei a nih."
