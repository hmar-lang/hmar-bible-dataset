1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,","Kaldai mihai rama lala siema um, Media chi Ahasuera naupa Daria kum khat kum;"
2,"in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.","a rorêl kum khat kuma chun kei Daniel hin kum sâwmsaria Jerusa- lem khuo suksieta a um ding hun tlungkimna ding, zâwlnei Jeremia kuoma LALPA thu hung tlung, kum- hai nizât chu lekhabuhaia inthawkin ka lo hriet tah a."
3,"And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.","Chun, vut laia saiip puon le in- ṭhunga bungheiin, hnina le ṭawng- ṭainaa zawng dingin LALPA Pathien kuom tieng chu ka ngha tah a."
4,"And I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments,","LALPA ka Pathien kuoma chun ka ṭawngṭai a, thuphachawina dâm ka siem a, “Aw LALPA, i thupêkhai kawltu le, nangma hmangaituhai kuoma zângaina le thuthlung kawltu Pathien ṭiumtak le ropui;"
5,"we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances;","kan lo suol tah a, indiklotakin kan lo thaw tah a; khawhlotakin kan lo thaw tah a, kan lo hel tah a; i rorêlnahai le thupêkhaia inthawka lo inher hmangin;"
6,"neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, that spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.","i siehlaw zâwlneihai, kan lalhai le, kan ṭhuoituhai le, kan thlatuhai le hi rama mi po po kuoma nangma hminga thu lo hril hlakhai thuhril chu kan ngaisak bawk nawh a."
7,"O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.","Aw LALPA, felna chu nangma ta a na; nisienlakhawm, vawisûn ni ang bawk hin, hmêl hamhaitak chu kan nei lem a; Juda mihai le, Jerusalem hluotuhai le, Israel rama mi po po khawm, i chunga an lo bawsiet ta leia an bawsietna leia anni i lo hnawt suokna ram po po, ram hla le ram hnaia umhai khawm chu angkhat vawng kan nih."
8,"O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.","Aw LALPA, i chungah thil kan lo suksuol ta leiin, keini chu kan lalhai leh, kan ṭhuoituhai leh, kan thlatuhai leh hmêl hamhaitak put kan nih."
9,To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him;,Zângaina le ngaidamna chu Lalpa kan Pathien ta a nih; ama chunga chun kan lo hel ta sih a;
10,"neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.","a siehlaw zâwlneihai hmanga kan hmaa ân entir a, a dânhai chu hraw dingin kan Pathien LALPA râwl chu kan awi naw bawk a."
11,"Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.","Anih, Israel mihai po po chun i râwl chu awi lo dinga inherhmangin i Dân chu an lo bawsiet tah a; chuleiin, ṭawngsie chu kan chungah, Pathien siehlaw Mosie dâna inkhâmna zieka um le chun buokin a um tah a; chuonga chun thil kan lo suksuol ta sih a."
12,"And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.","Kan chungah thil ṭha naw chu intlungtirin, keini le kan rorêltuhai, kan chunga rorêltuhai chungah a thu a hrilhai chu a hung sukdet tah a; Jerusalem khaw chunga thaw a ni ta ang hin vân hnuoi po po khâwlai khawm thaw a ni ngai si nawh a."
13,"As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.","Mosie Dâna ziek a ni angin hieng thil ṭha naw po po hi kan chungah a hung tlung a nih; chuong khawm chun, i thudik chu chîktaka ngaituona nei ding le kan rîtlonahaia inthawka inher hmang dingin LALPA kan Pathien ditsakna chu kan hni chuong nawh a."
14,"Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun thil ṭha naw chu a hmu zing a, kan chungah a hung intlungtir tah a nih; LALPA kan Pathien chu a sinthaw a thawhai po poa chun a fel a nih, keini ruok chun a râwl chu kan awi nawh a."
15,"And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.","Tuhin, aw LALPA kan Pathien, Aigupta rama inthawka i mihai kut hrâttak le hung ṭhuoi suoka, vawisûn ni anga hming inthangna changtu, kan lo suksuol tah a, rilotakin kan lo thaw tah a nih."
16,"O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us.","Aw LALPA, i felna ang peiin i lunginsenna le i ṭiumna chu i tlâng inthieng, Jerusalem i khuoa inthawk chun, ka hni che hi, herhmang ni raw se. Kan suolnahai lei le, kan thla- tuhai khawhlonahai lei chun Jerusa- lem le i mihai chu kan vêla mi po pohai hrilinsîm kan lo ni ta hi."
17,"Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.","Chuleiin, tuhin, aw kan Pathien, i siehlaw ṭawngṭaina le a hninahai chu ngai la, Lalpa zâra chun i Hmun Inthiengtak sukrêma um ta chunga chun i hmai chu invartir rawh."
18,"O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies’ sake.","Aw ka Pathien, i na hung sit la, hung ngai ta; i mithai hung meng la, sukrêma kan umnahai le, i hming inchawia sak khuo hi hung en ta; kan felnahai ni loin, amiruokchu, i zângaina leiin kan hninahai chu i hmaah kan hung intlun a ni lem sih a."
19,"O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.","Aw LALPA, lo hre ta, aw LALPA, ngaidam rawh, aw LALPA, lo hre la,hung thaw ta, muong naw la; nang- ma zâra ngei chun, aw ka Pathien, i khawpui le i mihai chu nangma hming chawia hming sak an ni leiin,” tiin."
20,"And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;","Chun, ṭawngṭaia, ka suolna le ka mi Israelhai suolna chu thupha- chawia, ka Pathien tlâng inthieng ta dinga ka Pathien LALPA hmaa ka hninahai kân tluna, ka ṭawng lai zing chun,"
21,"yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.","ṭawngṭaia ka ṭawng lai zing chun, mi pakhat Gabriel, a tîra thil hmulâwka ka hmu khan, zântienga thilinhlân hun lai hin, hrâttaka in- vuongtira umin a mi them a."
22,"And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding.","Chun, hre dingin a mi khîk- hmuh a, kei a mi biek a, “Aw Daniel, hrietna tienga thiemtaka siem ding chein ka hung a nih."
23,"At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.","I hninahai în tlun tîra inthawk khan thu chu a hung suok a, chun, hril ding chein ka hung tah a; nasataka ditsak i ni sih a; chuleiin, thil chu ngaituo la, thilhmulâwk thu chu a ngaina lo hre rawh."
24,"Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.","Hapta sâwm sarihai chu i mihai le khaw inthieng ta dinga bawsiet- nahai insûmna ding le suolnahai bân- sanna ding le, khawhlona ta dinga inremna siema, kumkhuoa felna chu insuona ding le, thilhmulâwk le hrillâwkna chu khârkhumna ding le, Hmun Inthiengtak chu hriek nâlna hun dinga pêk a nih."
25,"Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times.","Chuleiin, hre la, hrethiem rawh, Jerusalem khuo bâwl ding le siem thar dinga thupêk hung suoka inthawk Messie, Lal Naupa chen chu hapta sari le, hapta sâwmruk pahni nîng a ta, a kawtthlêr le a banghai chu siem nîng a tih, hun buoithlâk- taka khawm chun."
26,"And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall be war; desolations are determined.","Chun, hapta sâwmruk pahni hnunga chun Messie chu sât thlâk nîng a ta, ama ta dingin ni loin, chun, lal mihai hung dinghai chun khawpui le Hmun Inthiengtak chu suksieng an ta, a tâwpna chu tuilêt nîng a ta, a tâwpa chun indona nîng a tih; suk- rêma umna ding chu ruot a ni ta sih a."
27,"And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations shall come one that maketh desolate; and even unto the full end, and that determined, shall wrath be poured out upon the desolate.","Chun, hapta khat chu mi tam- tak leh thuthlung dettak siem a ta, chun, chu hapta chenve kâr chun inthâwina le thilinhlân chu suktâwp a tih; chun, tirdakumna thla chunga chun sukrêmtu inumtirtu ding chu hung a ta, a tâwpna ding ruot chen chun; chun, sukrêmtu chunga chun lunginsenna chu buok ni tâng a tih,” tiin."
