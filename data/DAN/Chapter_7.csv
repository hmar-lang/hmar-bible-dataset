1,In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.,"Babulon lal Belsazzar inlal kum khatnaa chun Daniel chun mang neiin a khum chunga chun a lua thil hmulâwkhai chu a hmu tah a; chun, mang chu a ziek a, chuong thilhai umzie chu a hril bawk a."
2,"Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.","Daniel chun a hril a, “Zâna hin ka thil hmulâwkna chun, ngai ta, vân thli hai pali chu tuisuoriet ropui- tak chunga an lo hrâng hi ka hmuh a."
3,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.","Tuisuorieta inthawk chun sa- hrâng pali, danglam seng hi an hung suok a."
4,"The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man’s heart was given to it.","A hmasatak chu sakeibaknei ang a na, mupui thlahai a nei a; a thlahai chu sukthlawnga uma, hnuoia in- thawka dawm kânga uma, mihriem anga ke pahnia inngîrtir a hung na, mihriem lungril a kuoma pêk a ni chen chun ka en zing a."
5,"And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.","Chun, ngai ta, sahrâng dang, a pahnina chu, savawm ang, a sîr khat tienga indawm kâng a na, a baua a hahai kâra chun nâkru pathum a um a; chun a kuoma chun, ‘Tho la, tisa tamtak fa zo vawng rawh,’ an ta."
6,"After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.","Hi hnunga hin, ngai ta, a dang keitê ang, a ruongzânga vate thlahai ang thla pali nei chu ka hmuh a; chu sahrâng chun lu pali khawm a nei bawk a, a kuoma chun rorêlna chu pêk a ni tah a."
7,"After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.","Hi hnunga hin zâna thil hmu- lâwkhai chu ka hmuh a, sahrâng palina chu, ngai ta, hrât êm êm el, thilthawtheitak, ṭiumtak el hi a na; thîr ha ropuitakhai chu a nei a; a fâk zo a, a suknâwiin a suknâwi a, a mahlahai chu a kehaiin a sirdeh a, a hmaa sahrânghai po poa inthawk khan danglamtak a na; chun, ki sâwm a nei bawk a."
8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.","Kihai chu ka ngaituoh a; chun, ngai ta, anni lai chun ki dang, ki chitê hi a hung suok a, chu hmaa chun ki hmasa pathumhai kha an zung chena phawi dawkin an um tah a; chun, ngai ta, chu kia chun mihriem mithai ang mithai le, bau thil ropuitaka ṭawngsuok chu a um bawk a."
9,"I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.","Ka en zing a. Lalṭhungphahai dâwin a um a, Tienlai mi pakhat hi a hung ṭhung tah a, A silfên chu vûr angin a vâr a, A lua sam chu sahmul inthiengtak ang a nih. A lalṭhungpha chu meichawk ṭiumtak a na, A kekuolhai chu meichawklai a nih."
10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.","Chun, tuihnâr ṭiumtak a hung suok a, A hma bula inthawk chun a hung suok a, Sâng sânga sângin a rawng an bâwl a, Sang sâwm sâwma vawi sâng sâwm a hmaa chun an ngîr a; Rorêlna chu ṭan a ni tah a, Lekhabuhai chu hawngin a um tah a."
11,"I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.","“Chu kiin thu ropuitakhai a hrilna râwlri lei chun chu lai chun ka en zing a; sahrâng chu thatin a um a, a taksa chu suksietin a um a, meia raw dinga pêka a um chen chun ka en zing a."
12,"And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.","Chun, sahrâng danghai ruok kha chu, an ram chu lâkpêk an ni tah a; nisienlakhawm, an hringnahai ruok chu hunbi khat le hun khat chenin suksei a nih."
13,"I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.","Zâna thil hmulâwkhai ka hmuh a, chun, ngai ta, Mi pakhat mihriem naupa ni âwm tak vân sûmhai le um a hung a, Tienlai mi kuoma ngei chun a hung a, Ama hmaa chun an hung ṭhuoi a."
14,"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.","Chun, ama chu mi po po le hnam po po le ṭawng tinrêngin, A rawng an bâwl theina dingin a kuoma chun Rorêlna dâm, ropuina dâm, lalram dâm an pêk a, A lalram chu chatuon lalram bo ta ngailo ding le, A ram suksieta um ta ngailo ding chu a nih."
15,"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.","“Kei Daniel ruok chu, ka taksa sûnga chun ka lungril chu suknatin a um a, ka lua thil hmulâwkna chun a mi suklungzîng hleh a."
16,"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.","Ka kâwla ngîrhai laia pakhat kuom chu ka hung hnai a, hi po po chungthua thudik chu kân dawn tah a. Chuongchun, ama chun a mi hril a, thil umziehai chu a mîn hriettir tah a."
17,"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.","‘Hieng sahrâng pali hi, lal pali hnuoi chunga la hung suok dinghai chu an nih."
18,"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.","Nisienlakhawm, Achunghnung- tak mi inthienghai chun ram chu chang an ta, chatuon, chatuon chenin ram chu nei an tih,’ tiin."
19,"Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;","“Chun, sahrâng palina, a dang- hai nêka danglam bîk, ṭiumtak, a hahai thîr nia, a tinhai chu dârsen nia, fa zo vawng a, a suknâwia suk- nâwi a, a mahla chu a kehaia sirdetu chungthua thudik chu hriet ka nuom tah a,"
20,"and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.","chun, a lua ki sâwmhai le, ki dang hung suoka, a hmaa pathum- hai chu thlawnga uma, chu ki ngei chun mithai a nei le, bau thil ropuitakhai ṭawngsuokna le, a hmêlputzie a ruolhai nêka ropui lem tak chungthu chu hriet ka nuom a."
21,"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;","Ka en zing a, chu ki chun mi inthienghai le chun indona a siem a, anni chu a hne tah a."
22,"until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.","Tienlai mi chu a hung a, Achunghnungtak mi inthienghai chu rorêlna chu a pêk a, mi inthienghaiin ram chu an chang hun a tlung hmakhat chun."
23,"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.","Chun, ama chun a hril a, ‘Sahrâng palina chu hnuoi chunga ram palina, ram dang po poa in- thawka danglam tak ding, hnuoi po po chu lem zo a, sirde a, a suknâwia suknâwitu ding chu a nih."
24,"And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.","Chun, ki sâwm chungthua chu: hi rama inthawk hin lal sâwm hung suok an ta, anni hnungah pakhat dang suok pei a ta; a hmaahai nêk chun danglam a ta, lal pathum chu suktlâwm a tih."
25,"And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.","Achunghnungtak chu kalin thu hril a ta, Achunghnungtak mi in- thienghai chu hung suksieng a tih: chun, hunhai le dân chu sukdanglam dingin ngaituong a ta, hun khat le hunhai le hun chenve sûng chu a kuta pêk nîng an tih."
26,"But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.","Nisienlakhawm, rorêlna chu um a ta, a tâwp chena suksiet a, sukbohmang dingin a ram chu lâkpêk an tih."
27,"And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.","Chun, vânhnuoia ram le lalram le ram ropuinahai chu Achunghnung- tak mi inthienghai hnam kuoma chun pêk nîng a ta, ama ram chu chatuon ram a na, ram po pohai chun a rawng bâwl an ta, ama thu awi an tih,’ tiin."
28,"Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.","“Hi hi thu tâwpna chu a nih a; kei Daniel ta ding chun ka ngai- tuonahai chun a mi sukbuoi hleh a, ka hmêlputziehai chu a hung dang- lam a; nisienlakhawm, chu thil chu ka lungrilah ka vawng zing a,” tiin."
