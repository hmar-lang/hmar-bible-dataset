1,"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.","Chun, Nebukadnezzarin ro a rêl a, a kum hninaa chun Nebukad- nezzar chun manghai a mang tah a, a lungril chu a hung buoi tah a, in khawm a in ṭha thei ta nawh a."
2,"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.","Chun, lal chun a manghai chu hrilfie dingin mitvaidawithiemhai, aisânthiemhai, dawithiemhai le Kal- dai mihai chu ko dingin thu a pêk tah a. Chuongchun, anni chu an hung lût a, lal hmaa chun an ngîr tah a."
3,"And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.","Lal chun an kuomah, “Mang ka nei a, chu mang chu hre suok nâwk dingin ka lungril a buoi ngawt el a nih,” a ta."
4,"Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.","Chun, Kaldai mihai chun lal kuoma chun Suria ṭawngin, “Aw lalpa, kumkhuoin dam rawh: i sie- hlawhai hi mang chu mi hril la, a umzie chu hril el kan ti che,” an ta."
5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, Kaldai mihai kuoma chun, “Chu thil chu keimaa inthawkin a fe hmang tlat tah a: mang le hrilfiena chu in mîn hriet- tir naw chun sât nawi vawng nîng in ta, in inhai chu êk pei khâwmna hmuna siem ni bawk a tih."
6,"But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof.","Nisienlakhawm, mang le a hril- fiena chu in mîn hriettir thei chun keimaa inthawkin thilpêkhai le lâwmmanhai le inzaumna nasatak hai hmûng in tih; chuleiin, mang le a hrilfiena chu mîn hmutir ro,” a ta."
7,"They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.","Chun, an dawn nâwk a, “Lal chun a siehlawhai hi mang chu hril phawt raw se, chun a hrilfiena chu hril kan tih,” an ta."
8,"The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.","Chun, lal chun a dawn a, “Chu thil chu keimaa inthawkin a fe hmang tlat tah ti in hmu lei hin, chu chu hun remchâng takah in hmang a nih ti ka hriet suok ngei a nih."
9,"But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.","Nisienlakhawm, mang chu in mîn hriettir naw chun, in ta dingin dân pakhat chau a um a nih: hun a hung inthleng hmakhat chu ka hmaa hin thu sie le khêl hril dingin in inbuotsai a ni sih a; chuleiin, mang chu mi hril unla; chun mang chu a hrilfiena in mîn entir thei ngei a nih ti ka hriet ding annâwm,” a ta."
10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.","Kaldai mihai chun lal chu an dawn a, “Hnuoi chung hrim hrima hin lal chungchâng thu hi ân entir thei ding tukhawm an um nawh: chu- nâksapah, lal khawmin, laltak khawmin, rorêltu khawmin hieng ang thil hi mitvaidawithiemhai ama- nih, aisânthiemhai amanih, Kaldai mihai kuoma mani khawm an indawn ngai hrim hrim nawh."
11,"And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.","Lal thil dit dân hi thil vângkhat tak a nih; tisaa chêng nilo pathienhai ti chau naw chu tukhawm lal hmaa inentir thei ding hrim hrim an um nawh,” an ta."
12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.","Hi thil chunga hin lal chu a lunginsen a, ṭi a um ta êm êm a, Babulona mi var po pohai chu sukbo- hmang dingin thu a pêk tah a."
13,"So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.","Chuongchun, thupêk chu a fe suok tah a, mi varhai chu sukhlum ding an lo ni tah a; Daniel le a ruolhai khawm chu sukhlum dingin an zawng tah a."
14,"Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;","Chun, Daniel chun, lal vêngtu sipai pâwl hotu Ariok, Babulon rama mi varhai sukhlum dinga fe suoktu kuoma chun varna le thurâwnna dawnnain a lo râwn tah a;"
15,"he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.","lal sipai hotu Ariok chu a dawn a, “Lala inthawka thupêk iengdinga pawimaw êm êm am a nih a?” a ta. Chun, Ariok chun Daniel kuoma chun thil chu ân hriettir a."
16,"And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.","Chun, Daniel chu a va lût a, ama chu hun ruotpêk a, a mang umzie chu lal chu inentir dingin lal chu a ngên a."
17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:","Chun, Daniel chu a ina chun a va feh a, a ruolhai Hanania hai, Misael hai, Azaria hai chu thil chu ân hriettir tah a;"
18,that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.,"Babulona mi var danghai lai chun Daniel le a ruolhai chu an thi ve nawna dinga, hi thurûk chungchâng thua hin vâna Pathien zângaina chu an ngên theina dingin."
19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.,"Chun, zâna thilhmulâwkin Daniel kuoma chun chu thurûk chu phuongin a um tah a. Chun, Daniel chun vâna Pathien chu ân pâk tah a."
20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.","Daniel chun a dawn a, “Pathien hming chu chatuon chatuon chenin inpâkin um raw se, Varna le hrâtna dâm chu ama ta a ni sih a."
21,"And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding;","Hunhai le hunbihai chu a sukdanglam a, Lalhai chu a suktlâwmin lalhai chu a tungding a; Mi varhai kuoma chun varna a pêk a, hrietna neihai kuoma chun hrietthiemna a pêk bawk a;"
22,"he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.","Thurûkhai le thil inthûk- hai chu an kuomah a phuong a, Inthima thil um chu a hriet a, var chu amaa chun a um a nih."
23,"I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter.","Aw nang kan thlatuhai Pathien, varna le hrâtna mi petu, Kân pâk cheh a, i kuomah lâwmthu ka hung hril hi, Kan hung ngên chu i mîn hriettir tah a, Lal thu chungchâng hi kan kuomah i hung inhriettir ta sih a,” tiin."
24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.","Chuongchun, Daniel chu lalin Babulona mi varhai sukbohmang dinga a ruot Ariok kuoma chun a va lût a, a va feh a, a kuoma chun, “Babulona mi varhai hi sukbohmang naw rawh; lal kuoma chun mi ṭhuoi lût la, mang umzie chu lal chu inentir ka tih,” a ta."
25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.","Chun, Ariok chun Daniel chu lal hmaa chun inhmâwtakin a hung ṭhuoi lût a, a kuoma chun, “Juda ram mi sal intânghai lai hin, a mang umzie lal chu inhriettir ding mi pakhat ka hmu suok tah,” a ta."
26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?","Lal chun a dawn a, Daniel, a hming Beltesazzar kuoma chun, “Mang ka ihmu tâk le a umzie chu nang hin i mîn hriettir thei ding maw?” a tih a, ân dâwn a."
27,"Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king;","Daniel chun lal hmaa chun a dawn a, “Thurûk lalin a iphût hi mi varhaiin amani, aisânthiemhaiin amani, mitvaidawithiemhaiin amani, vânghriltuhaiin amani khawm lal chu inentir thei naw ni hai;"
28,"but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:","amiruokchu, vânah Pathien, thurûkhai phuongtu chu a um a, ama chun lal Nebukadnezzar chu ni nuhnunga thil um dinghai chu ân hriettir a nih. I mang le i khum chunga i lua i thil hmulâwkhai chu hienghi an nih:"
29,"as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.","nanga ta ding chun, aw lalpa, hi hnunga thil la hung tlung dinghai chu i khum chungah i ngaituonahai chu i lungrilah a hung lût a nih; thurûkhai phuongtu chun thil la hung tlung ding chu ân hriettir che a ni chu."
30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.","Keima chungthua chun, mi dang hrim nêka varna ka hau lem leia hi thurûk hi phuong a ni nawh a; amiruokchu, a umzie chu lal kuoma inhriettir a ni theina ding le i lungrila i ngaituohai chu i hriet theina dingin a ni lem."
31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible.","Aw lalpa, ngai ta, milim ropuitak el i hmuh a, i en zing a. Chu milim nasatak el le, a varna nasatak el chu i hmaa chun a ngîr a; a hmêl- putzie chu râpthlâktak el a na."
32,"As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,","Hi milim chung thu chu, a lu chu rângkachak inthieng a na, a âwm le a bânhai chu tangkaruo a nih; a phîng le, a êlpuihai chu dârsen a na,"
33,"its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.","a kehai chu thîr a na, a kepha- hai chu a ṭhen thîr, a ṭhen chu bepil a nih."
34,"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.","Chun, kut loin lungpui a hung insât thlâk a, chu milim thîr le pil kehaia ngîr chu a hung del a, nawi tamtaka a suknawi vawng chen i en a."
35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.","Chun, thîr dâm, pil dâm, dârsen dâm, tangkaruo dâm le rângkachak dâm chu inang rawngin an innawi tah a; nipui laia hrizâwlhaia busi ang el an hung ni tah a; chun, anni ta ding hrimin hmun hmu a ni ta nawh a, thli chun a lên hmang vawng tah a; chun, kha lung milim deltu kha tlâng ropuitak a hung na, khawvêl po po a hluo sip tah a."
36,This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.,"Hi hi mang chu a na, chu chu umzie chu lal hmaa hin kan hril ding a nih."
37,"Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;","Aw lalpa, nang chu lalhai lal, vâna Pathienin ram dâm, thilthaw- theina dâm, hrâtna dâm le ropuina dâm a pêk che chu i nih;"
38,"and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold.","mihriem nauhai chêngna ta- phawt le, ramhnuoia ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai umna taphawt chu i kutah a pêk vawng a, an rênga chunga chun rorêl dingin a siem cheh a: chuongchun, nang chu rângkachak lu chu i nih."
39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.","Chun, nanga hnunga hin ram dang nanga nêka chîn lem la hung suok a ta; chun, ram pathumna dârsen chun khawvêl chung po poa rorêlna chu nei a tih."
40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.","Chun, ram palina chu thîr anga hrât nîng a ta; thîr chu a nawiin ân nawi tah a, thil po po hne angin; chu thîr chuong thil po po suknâwitu ang chu nawi tamtakah sukdar nîng a ta, râwtnawi la nîng a tih."
41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.","Chun, a kehai le a kepârhai chu aṭhen bêlhemtu pil le aṭhen thîra i hmu ang khan, ram inṭhe hung nîng a tih, nisienlakhawm, bepil chu thîr le inpawla i hmu ang tak khan amaa chun thîr hrâtna chu um a tih."
42,"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.","Chun, kehai, kepârhai chu aṭhen thîr a na, aṭhen chu pil a ni ang khan, chu ram khawm chu aṭhena chu hrât hlêng a ta, aṭhena chu hrât naw hlêng a tih."
43,"And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.","Chun, thîr chu bepil inhnâk le inpawla i hmu ang tak khan anni chu mihriem chiah inchawkpawl an ta; nisienlakhawm, thîr chun pil chu ân pâwlpui thei naw ang bawkin anni chu inzawm tlat naw ni hai."
44,"And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.","Chun, chuong lalhai huna chun vâna Pathien chun suksieta um ta ngailo ding le, lal nina chu mi dang kuoma pêka um ta ngai lo ding ram pakhat hung siem suok a ta; chuong- chun, chuong ramhai chu kawi tam- taka hung sukkawiin, hung kâng- hmang a ta, kumkhuoin ama chu um ta lem a tih."
45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.","Chun, tlânga inthawka lung chu kuthai ṭhang lova sât thlâka uma, thîr dâm, dârsen dâm, pil dâm, tangkaruo dâm le rângkachak dâm chu a nâwia a sukkawi i hmu ta ang khan, Pathien ropuitak chun hi hnunga thil hung um ding lal kuoma chun a hung inhriettir a ni hi; mang chu indik ngei a ta, a umzie khawm chu indik bawk a tih,” a ta."
46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.","Chun, lal Nebukadnezzar chu a bawkkhup a, Daniel chu chibai a bûk a, ama kuoma chun riminhnikhai le inthâwina inhlân dingin thu a pêk tah a."
47,"The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.","Chun, lal chun Daniel chu a dawn a, “Indiktakin, i Pathien chu pathienhai Pathien, lalhai Lalpa, hi thurûk hi i phuong theizie hmu hrim hin, thurûkhai phuongtu chu a ni ngei hi,” a ta."
48,"Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.","Chun, lal chun Daniel chu ropuitakin a siem a, thilpêk ropui- takhai a pêk a, Babulon rama mi var po po chunga hotu tak le Babulon biel sûng po poa rorêl dingin a siem tah a."
49,"And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.","Chun, Daniel chun lal chu a hnih a, ama chun Sadrak hai, Mesak hai, Abednego hai chu Babulon chungchâng thuha hotu dingin a ruot a. Daniel ruok chu lal rorêlna ina chun a um ta lem a."
