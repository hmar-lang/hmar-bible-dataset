1,"And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.","“Chun, kei chu, Median mi Daria kum khatna kum chun ama chu sukhrâta sukdet dingin ka ngîr tah a."
2,"And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.","“Chun, tuhin thudik chu inentir ka ti che. Ngai ta, Persiaa hin lal pathum la hung ngîrsuok an ta; a palina chu anni po po nêk chun nasatakin hausa lem a tih: chun, a hausakna leia a hung hrât chun, Grik ram do dingin mi po po chawktho a tih."
3,"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.","Chun, lal thilthawtheitak, ram ropuitaka rorêltu ding chu hung ngîrsuok a ta, a nuom ang ang chu hung thâwng a tih."
4,"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.","A hung ngîrsuok phingle chun a ram chu sukkhawi nîng a ta, kawlkil palihai anga chun sem dar nîng a tih; a thlahai amani le a rorêlna ram dungzui chun ni chuong naw nih a, a ram chu hieng mihai titâk lo khawm mi danghai ta ding khawma suk- thlawng a ni ding a ni sih a."
5,"And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.","“Chun, simtieng lal chu hung hrât a ta, a lalhai laia pakhat leh; ama nêk chun hung hrât a ta, lal ram chu hung nei a tih; a lal ram chu ram ropuitak hung ni bawk a tih."
6,"And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times.","Kum iengzât amani hnunga chun anni chu hung inzawm khâwm an ta, simtienga lal naunu chu hmârtienga lal kuoma chun inremna siem dingin hung a tih; nisienlakhawm, a kut hrâtna chu nei sawng naw nih; amapa chu ngîr naw nih a, a kut khawm châng bawk naw ni; nisien- lakhawm, chuong nihaia amanu lo sukhrâttu le amanu lo thlatupa le, ama hung ṭhuoituhai chu amanu le chun bânsanin um an tih."
7,"But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.","Nisienlakhawm, a zunghai puok- suoka inthawkin mi pakhat a hmuna chun hung ngîrsuok a ta, ama chu sipai pâwl leh hung a ta, hmârtieng lal kula chun hung lût a ta, anni chu do a ta, hne bawk a tih;"
8,"And also their gods, with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north.","an pathienhai le, an milim sunga sunghai le, an tangkaruo le rângka- chak bûrlebêl ṭhatak takhai chu râllâkin Aigupta rama chun phur hmang bawk a tih; chun, kum tam lem sûng chu hmârtieng lal nêkin inlal a tih."
9,"And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.","“Chun, simtieng lal rama chun hung lût a ta, nisienlakhawm, ama rama bawk kîr nâwk a tih."
10,"And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they shall return and war, even to his fortress.","A naupasalhai chun sipai ropui- tak tamtak el khâwm an ta, do an ta, chu chu hung an ta, a luongin hung luong liem an ta, fe thleng an tih; chun, hung kîr nâwk an ta, a kul ngei chu hung do an tih."
11,"And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.","Chun, simtieng lal nasataka suklungsenin um a ta, hung suok a ta, hmâr tieng lal ngei chu hung do a tih; chun, mipui nasatak chu hung tir suok a ta, chu mipui nasatak chu a kutah pêk nîng a tih."
12,"And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.","Chun, mipui chu ṭhuoi hmang hung nîng an ta, ama chu a lungril chu hung inchawisâng a ta, sâng sâwm tamtak chu hung pei thlûng a ta, nisienlakhawm, hrât pha ngai naw ni."
13,"And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance.","Hmâr tieng lal chu hung kîr nâwk a ta, a hmasa nêka mi tam lem chu hung ṭhuoi a ta; chun, kumhai tâwpah, hunhai tâwpa chun sipai nasatak le hausakna tamtak leh hung a tih."
14,And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall.,"“Chuong hun haia chun sim- tieng lal chunga chun mi tamtak hung ngîrsuok an ta, i mihai laia dân hmanglo mihai ngei khawm thilhmu- lâwk chu hung suktlung dingin hung inmawrkâng an ta, nisienlakhawm, tlûng an tih."
15,"So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to stand.","Chun, hmârtieng lal chu hung a ta, tlâng hung siem a ta, khawpui kulnei khawm chu hung lâng a tih; simtieng kuthai chun dangkîr naw nih a, a mi thlanghai khawmin, a dang kîr zo ding hrâtna hrim hrim um naw ni."
16,"But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.","Chuongchun, ama hung rûntu- hai chu a nuom nuom lo lâwng a ta, ama hmaa chun tukhawm ngîr thei naw ni hai: ram ropuia chun ngîr a ta, a kuta chun suksietna um bawk a tih."
17,"And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him.","A hmêl chu amaa mi ngîlhai le, a ram pumpui hrâtna le hung dingin nghâng a ta; a nuom nuom thâwng a ta, nuhmei naunuhai chu sukkhaw- hlo dingin ama chu pêng a ta; ni- sienlakhawm, amanu chu a kuomah ngîr naw nih a, a ta ni thei bawk naw ni."
18,"After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.","Hi hnunga hin, thlierkâr tienga chun nghâng a ta; tamtak chu lâng a tih; nisienlakhawm, sipai hotu chun zilna amain a pêk chu suktâwp a ta, anih, chu naw khawm chu, a zilna chu ama chungah inumtir bawk a tih."
19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.","Chun, ama rama kul tieng ngei chu nghâng a ta; nisienlakhawm, insui a ta, tlûng a ta, ama chu hmu ni ta ngai naw ni."
20,"Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.","“Chun, ama hmuna chun mi pakhat, ram ropuinaa leiman khawna infethlengtirtu ding chu hung ngîrsuok a ta, nisienlakhawm, in- dona amanih, lunginsenna amani khawm ni loin, ama chu ni sâwt- nawtêah sukbohmang nîng a tih."
21,"And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.","Chun, ama hmuna chun mi hmusitumtak hung ngîrsuok a ta, ama kuoma chun ram ropuina chu pêk ni naw ni; nisienlakhawm, muongna hun laitak hung a ta, simbudawiin ram chu lâng a tih."
22,"And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.","Ama hmaa chun tuilêt hrâtnain anni chu la hmang a ta, suksiet nîng an tih; anih, thuthlung hotu ngei khawm chu suksiet nîng a tih."
23,"And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.","Chun, ama le inzawmna siem a ni hnung chun, hmusitumtakin sin thâwng a ta; ama chu mi tlâwmte leh hung a ta, a hrât hle ding a ni sih a."
24,"In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.","Inrem lai huna chun ram buoina um nawna hmun hmunahai chun hung a ta, a thlatuhai thlatu- hai amani, a thlatuhaiin amani thil an thaw ngailo chu hung thâwng a tih; chun, anni lai chun hausak- na dâm, râllâk thil dâm le râl- that dâm chu the dar a ta; anih, vawikhat nana na chu a tumnahai chu kul dettak tieng chu innghat a tih."
25,And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise devices against him.,"Chun, sipai ropuitak leh a thilthawtheina le a huoina chu simtieng lal chunga chun chawktho a ta; simtieng lal chun ama chu sipai hrâttak le ropuitak el le chun indonaa chun do a ta; nisienlakhawm, ngîr zo naw nih, ama chunga chun rem chu a lo ruot ding a ni leiin."
26,"Yea, they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.","Anih, ama bu fatuhai chun ama chu suksieng an ta, a sipaihai chu a luongin luong liem an ta; mi tamtak chu sukhluma umin tlûng an tih."
27,"And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.","Chun, hi lal hai ve ve hi chu; an lungrilhai chu thil suol thawna lung- ril nîng a ta; dawkân hmunkhata chun thukhêlhai hril an tih; nisien- lakhawm, hlawtling naw nih a, a tâwpna chu hun ruota chun a la ni ding a ni sih a."
28,"Then shall he return into his land with great substance; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do his pleasure, and return to his own land.","Chun, ama rama chun thuom- hnaw tamtak le chun kîr nâwk a ta; a lungril chu Thuthlung Inthieng kal zâwng ni tâng a ta, a nuom ang angin thâwng a tih; chun, ama ram bawka chun kîr nâwk a tih."
29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.","“Hun ruota chun hung kîr nâwk a ta, simtieng hung a tih; nisien- lakhawm, a hun nuhnung lema chun a hun hmasa lem ang kha ni ta naw ni."
30,"For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do his pleasure: he shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant.","Kittima lawnghai chun ama an hung rûn ding a ni sih a; chuleiin, lungngai a ta, hung kîr nâwk a ta, Thuthlung Inthieng chunga chun lunginsenna nei a ta, a nuom ang angin thâwng a tih; kîr nâwk a ta, chuong Thuthlung Inthieng nghat- santuhai chu ngaisak a tih."
31,"And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt-offering, and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.","Sipaihai chu ama tieng chun ngîr an ta, Hmun Inthiengtak chu hrilsieng an ta, kulpui ngei khawm chu; chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân zing zing chu la hmang an ta, sukrêmna intluntu tirdakumna chu sie lem an tih."
32,"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.","Chuonga Thuthlung chunga khawhlotaka thawin, simbudawiin suk hmingsieng a tih; nisienla- khawm, chuong mihai an Pathien hretuhai chu hung hrât an ta, thil nasatak hung thâwng an tih."
33,"And they that are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days.","Chun, mihai laia a varhai chun, mi tamtak inchûktir an ta; ni tamtak sûng, râllâk le, sala manin mei le kâwlhnâmin tlûng an tih."
34,"Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries.","An tlûk pha chun, anni chu ṭhangpuina tlâwmtêa ṭhangpui nîng an ta; nisienlakhawm, mi tamtak chun anni chu simbudawiin hung zâwm an tih."
35,"And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.","Chun, chuong a varhai chu hun tâwpa chun anni chu sukvar ding le, sukfai ding le, sukṭha dingin tlûng an tih; hun ruota ding chu a la ni leiin."
36,"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done.","“Chun, lal chun a nuom ang angin thâwng a ta, ama le ama chu inchawimawi a ta, pathien po po chunga chun ama chu inchawisâng a tih; chun, pathienhai Pathien chu kalin thil râpthlâktak takhai chu hril a tih, thaw dinga tum ta po chu thaw a ni ding a na, lunginsenna chu hrîk- thlâk a ni hmakhat chu hlawtling pei a tih."
37,"Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all.","Nuhmeihai châkna amanih, a thlatuhai pathienhai amani khawm chu ngaisak naw nih a, pathien hrim hrim ngaisak naw ni, chuong chung po poa chun ama chu ân chawisâng ding a ni sih a."
38,"But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones and pleasant things.","Nisienlakhawm, ama hmuna chun kulhai pathien chu inza thung a ta, a thlatuhaiin pathien an hriet ngainaw chu thil ṭhahai le, lungman- tamhai le, tangka le rângkachakin chawimawi a tih."
39,"And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god: whosoever acknowledgeth him he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.","Chun, pathien danglam ṭhang- puiin kulhai chu thâwng a ta, tukhawm ama hrefu taphawt chu ropuina sukpungpêk a ta, mi tamtak chunga rorêltu dingin siem a ta, ram chu man neiin sem dar bawk a tih."
40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through.","Chun, hun tâwpa chun simtieng lal chun ama chu nawr a ta; hmâr- tieng lal chun lawng tamtakhai leh, sakawr chung chuong mihai leh, sakawr tawlailîrhai leh phaivaw hrâng ang elin ama chu hung rûn a tih; chun, ramhaia chun hung lût a ta, palzêl a ta, fe thleng a tih."
41,"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.","Ram ropuia khawm chun hung lût a ta, ram tamtak chu hne hung nîng an tih; nisienlakhawm, hieng Edom hai, Moab hai, Ammon thlahai lal hi a kuta inthawk chun sansuok nîng an tih."
42,He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.,Ramhai chunga chun a kut chu inlet a ta; Aigupta ram khawm chun pumpel bîk naw ni.
43,"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.","Nisienlakhawm, Aigupta rama thil hluhai po po le, tangka le rângkachak ro bâwmhai chunga chun thuneina nei a ta; Libua mihai le Ethiopia mihai chu a kaiza vêng chun um an tih."
44,But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.,"Nisienlakhawm, saktieng le hmârtienga thuthanghai chun ama chu sukbuoi an ta, mi tamtak chu sukbohmang dêr ding le sukse dingin lunginsentakin fe suok a tih."
45,"And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.","Chun, a lal chêngna puon in chu tlâng inthienga tuisuoriet inkâra chun kei a ta; nisienlakhawm, a tâwpna tlung tho a tih, tukhawma ama chu an ṭhangpui si nawh a."
