1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.","Lal Belsazzar chun a lalhai sâng khat ta dingin ruoi ropuitak a ṭheh a, sâng khat hmaa chun uoin a dâwn tah a."
2,"Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink therefrom.","Belsazzar chun uoin chu a hang dâwn chun, lal le a lalhai le a nu- hmeihai le, a thaikêmhai chun an dâwnna dingin, a pa Nebukadnezzar- in Jerusalem Templea inthawka a lâk, rângkachak le tangkaruo bûr le bêlhai chu hung la dingin thu a pêk tah a."
3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.","Chun, Jerusalema Pathien in Templea rângkachak bûr le bêl an lâk tahai chu an hung lâk tah a; lal le a lalhai le, a nuhmeihai le a thaikêm- hai chun chuonga chun uoin an dâwn tah a."
4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.","Uoin chu an hang dâwn a, râng- kachak dâm, tangka dâm, dârsen dâm, thîr dâm, thing dâm, lung dâm pathienhai chu an inpâk tah a."
5,"In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.","chun, chu dâr ma chun mihriem kut kutpârhai a hung suok a, lal in bang nâl vâr chunga chun sathâu khâwnvar sana chun a ziek tah a; chun, lal chun chu kut bawng, chu hung ziektu chu a hmuh a."
6,"Then the king’s countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.","Chun, lal hmêlput dân chu a hung danglam a, a ngaituonahai chun ama a sukbuoi tah a; a kâwngru insuktuoknahai chu a hung inthâwt a, a khûp le khûp chu an invuoktuo tah a."
7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.","Chun, aisânthiemhai, Kaldai mi- hai le vânghriltuhai chu hung ṭhuoi dingin lal chu inringtakin a khêk tah a. Lal chun Babulona mi varhai kuoma chun, “Tukhawm hi lekhaziek hi tiem a, a umzie mîn entir thei taphawt chu puon senduk insiltirin a rînga chun rângkachak khaidiet inhlitir nîng a ta, hi ram rorêltu pathumna chu ni bawk a tih,” a ta."
8,"Then came in all the king’s wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.","Chun, lal mi varhai po po chu an hung lût a; nisienlakhawm, lekhaziek chu an tiem thei nawh a, a umzie khawm chu lal chu an inhriettir thei nawh a."
9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.","Chuongchun, lal Belsazzar chu nasatakin a lunginzîng tah a, a hmêl chu a hung danglam a, a lalhai khawm chu an lunginzîng nasa hleh a."
10,"Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.","Chuongchun, lal le a lalhai thuhai lei chun ruoiṭhena ina chun lalnu chu a hung lût a, lalnu chun a hril a, “Aw lalpa, kumkhuoin dam rawh, i ngaituonahai chun sukbuoi naw sienla che, i hmêlput dân khawm danglam bawk naw raw se."
11,"There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;","I rama hin mi pakhat amaa pathien inthienghai thlarau umna chu a um a; i pa damlai khawm êngna dâm, hrietthiemna dâm, pathienhai varna anga varna dâm amaa chun hmu suokin a um tah a: aw lalpa, i pa Nebukadnezzar, i pa chun ama chu mitvaidawithiemhai, aisânthiemhai, Kaldai mihai le vânghriltuhai hotuah a siem a,"
12,"forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.","lalin Beltesazzar ân bûk Daniela chun, thu ringhla umhai sukfelin, thu khirtakhai a umzie inentirin le manghai hrilfiein, amaa chun hrietna dâm, thiemna dâm le lungril ṭha bîk chu hmu suokin a um a. Tuhin Daniel chu inkotir la, a umzie chu inentir el a tih,” a ta."
13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?","Chun, lal hmaa chun Daniel chu an hung ṭhuoi lût a, lal chun Daniel kuomah, “Ka pa lalin Juda rama inthawka a hung ṭhuoi, Juda mi sal intânghai laia mi, Daniel chu i ni maw?"
14,"I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.","I chanchin ka lo hriet a, pathienhai thlarau chu nangmaah a um a, nangmaa chun êngna le thiem- na le varna ṭha bîk chu hmuin a um ti ka lo hriet bawk a."
15,"And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.","Tuhin, hi lekhaziek hi an tiema a umzie an mîn hriettir theina dingin mi varhai le aisânthiemhai chu ka hmaah ṭhuoi lûtin an um a; ni- sienlakhawm, thil umzie chu an inentir thei nawh a."
16,"But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.","Amiruokchu, a umziehai chu i hril theiin, thu ringhlaumhai khawm chu i sukfel thei tiin i chanchin hi ka lo hriet a; tuhin, lekhaziek hi i tiem thei a, a umzie chu i mîn hriettir thei chun puon senduk insiltir nîng i ta, i rîngah rângkachak khaidiet inhlitir ni bawk i ta, hi rama hin rorêltu pathumna chu nîng i tih,” a ta."
17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.","Daniel chun a dawn a, lal hmaa chun, “I thilpêkhai chu nangma ta ni lem sienla, i lâwmmanhai chu mi dang kuomah pe lem rawh, amiruok- chu, lekhaziek chu lal kuoma chun tiem ka ta, a umzie chu inhriettir ka tih."
18,"O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:","Aw nang lalpa, Achunghnung- tak Pathien chun i pa Nebukadnezzar chu ram dâm, ropuina dâm, nasatna dâm, inlalna dâm a pêk a;"
19,"and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.","ropuina a pêk lei chun a hmaa chun mi po pohai, hnam po pohai le ṭawng tinhai chu an inthinin an ṭih a; a nuom nuom a that a, a nuom nuom chu a sukhring bawk a; a nuom nuom chu a kei sâng a, a nuom nuom chu a kei hnuoi bawk a."
20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:","Nisienlakhawm, a lungril chu a hung insâng a, a lungril a hung ngar phingle chun chapotakin a thaw tah a, ân lalna lalṭhungphaa inthawk chun sie hnuoiin a um tah a, amaa inthawk chun a ropuina chu an lâk hmang a,"
21,"and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts’, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will.","chun, mihriem nauhai laia inthawk chun hnawt hmangin a um a; a lungril chu ramsahai lungril anga siem a hung na; a umna hmun chu ram sabengtunghai lai a ni tah a; chun, bâwngchal angin hlobet chu a ring a, a taksa chu vâna inthawka daidawin a sukhu ta bawk a: mi- hriemhai ram chunga hin Pathien Chunghnungtakin ro a rêl a, a nuom nuom chu a chunga chun a sie hlak ti a hriet hmakhat chun."
22,"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this,","Aw Belsazzar, nang a naupa hin hi thil po po hi i hriet sa khawma i lungril i sukhnuoi nawh a;"
23,"but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.","Vâna Lalpa chu kalin nang le nang în chawisâng ta lem a; a ina bûrlebêlhai chu i hmaa chun an hung lâk a, nang le i lalhai le i nuhmeihai le i thaikêmhai chun chuonga chun uoin in dâwn tah a; chun, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, dârsen dâm, thîr dâm, thing dâm, lung dâm pathien- hai, hmu thei lo le, hre thei lo le, hrietna neilohai chu in inpâk a; Pathien a kuta i hringna umna le ama i lampui po po umna chu i chawi- mawi nawh a,"
24,"Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.","ama hmaa inthawk chun hi kut bawng hi hungtir a ni tah a, hi lekhaziek hi a hung ziek tah a nih."
25,"And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.","Chun, hi hi lekhaziek hung in- ziek chu a nih: MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN."
26,"This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end.","Chu thil umzie chu hi hi a nih: MENE chu ‘Pathien chun i ram chu a tiem zo tah a, a tâwp chu ân tlun tah a nih,’ tina a na."
27,"TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.","TEKEL chu ‘Bûknahaia chun bûkin i um a, tling loa hmu i nih,’ tina a nih."
28,"PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.","PERES chu ‘I ram chu ṭhe a ni tah a, Media le Persia mihai kuom- a chun pêk a ni tah,’ tina a nih,” tiin."
29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.","Chun, Belsazzar chun thu a pêk a, Daniel chu puon senduk an insiltir a, a rînga chun rângkachak khaidiet an inhlitir a; chun, ama chungthua chun ram sûnga rorêltu pathumna chu a ni ding a nih ti thuphuong a siem tah a."
30,In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.,Chu zân chun Kaldai lal Belsazzar chu thatin a um tah a.
31,"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.","Chun, Media mi Daria chun ram chu a nei tah a, ama chu kum sâwmruk pahnia upa a nih."
