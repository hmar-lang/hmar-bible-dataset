1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.","Lal Nebukadnezzar chun rângka- chak milim a siem a, ân sângzie chu tawng sâwmruk a na, a khang- tieng chu tawng ruk a nih; Babulon biel sûnga Dura phaizâwla chun ân ngîrtir tah a."
2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.","Chun, lal Nebukadnezzarin mi- lim ân ngîrtir chu inhlân dinga hung dingin, lal Nebukadnezzar chun biel awptuhai, ram awptuhai, sipaihotu- hai, lalhai, tangka sum enkawltuhai, rorêltuhai, dân hre mihai le ram bunga rorêltuhai po po chu a ko khâwm vawng a."
3,"Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.","Chun, biel awptuhai, ram awp- tuhai, sipaihotuhai, lalhai, tangka sum enkawltuhai, rorêltuhai le dân hre mihai le ram bunga rorêltuhai po po chu lal Nebukadnezzarin milim ân ngîrtir inhlânnaa chun an hung khâwm vawng a; chuongchun, Nebu- kadnezzarin milim ân ngîrtir hmaa chun an ngîr tâwl a."
4,"Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,","Chun, tlângsam chu inringtakin a hung khêk a, “Aw mipui po pohai, hnam po pohai le, ṭawng po pohai, in kuomah hieng anga thupêk hi a nih:"
5,"that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;","tawtawrâwt dâm, theihle dâm, ṭingṭang dâm, rawsem dâm, per- khuong dâm, baza dâm le rimawi chi tinrêng inri in hriet pha leh, lal Nebukadnezzarin rângkachak milim ân ngîrtir hmaa hin bawkkhup in ta, chibai in bûk ding a nih;"
6,and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.,"tukhawm bawkkhup lo a, chibai bûk lo chu, chu dârkâr sûng ngei chun meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka pei- lût nîng a tih,” a tih a."
7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.","Chuleiin, chu lai chun, mipuihai chun tawtawrâwt dâm, theihle dâm, ṭingṭang dâm, rawsem dâm, per- khuong le rimawi tinrênghai ri chu an hriet chun, mipui po po le, hnam po pohai le, ṭawng po pohai chu lal Nebukadnezzarin rângkachak milim ân ngîrtir hmaa chun an bawkkhup a, chibai an bûk tah a."
8,"Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.","Chuongchun, chu lai chun, Kaldai mi ṭhenkhat an hung hnai a, Juda mihai chungah hêkna an hung siem tah a."
9,"They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.","Anni chun lal Nebukadnezzar kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, kumkhuoin dam rawh."
10,"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;","Aw lalpa, nang chun thupêk i siem a: tawtawrâwt dâm, theihle dâm, ṭingṭang dâm, rawsem dâm, perkhuong dâm le rimawi tinrêng an hriet pha chun mi tin chu bawkkhup an ta, rângkachak milim chu chibai an bûk ding a na;"
11,"and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.","chun, tukhawm bawkkhupa chi- bai bûk naw taphawt chu meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka chun pei lût nîng an tih, tiin."
12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.","Juda mi ṭhenkhat hieng Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai Babulon biel sûng chungchâng thua hotua i ruothai kha, khânghai rawi khan, aw lalpa, an pawisa naw che a nih, i pathienhai rawng chu an bâwl nawh a, rângkachak milim în ngîrtir khawm kha chibai an bûk bawk nawh,” an ta."
13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.","Chun, Nebukadnezzar chun a lungsenna le a ṭitumna chun Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai chu hung ṭhuoi dingin thu a pêk a. Chun, chuong mihai chu lal hmaa chun an hung ṭhuoi tah a."
14,"Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?","Nebukadnezzar chun a dawn a, an kuomah, “Aw Sadrak, Mesak, Abednego, ka pathien rawng chu in bâwl nawh a, rângkachak milim kân ngîrtir khawm hi chibai in bûk nawh ti hi ân dik am a nih?"
15,"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?","tuhin tawtawrâwt dâm, theihle dâm, ṭingṭang dâm, rawsem dâm, perkhuong dâm, baza le rimawi tinrêng ri chu in hriet pha pha, in bawkkhupa milim ka siem chu chi- bai in bûk ding chun a ṭha; ami- ruokchu, chibai in bûk naw chun, chu dârkâr sûng ngeia chun meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka chun peiin um in tih; ka kuta inthawka sansuok ding cheu pathien chu tu am a ni leh?” a ta."
16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.","Sadrak, Mesak le, Abednego chun an dawn a, lal kuoma chun, “Aw Nebukadnezzar, hi thil chungchâng thua hin kan dawn che a ṭûl nawh."
17,"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.","Chuong chu a ni ding chun, kan Pathien a rawng kan ibâwl chun meithuk chawklai râpthlâka inthawk chun a mi sanhim thei a; aw lalpa, i kuta inthawk khawmin a mi sanhim thei a nih."
18,"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.","Chuong chu ni naw ding khawm ni sien, i pathienhai chu an rawng bâwl naw ning ung a, rângkachak milim în ngîrtir khawm chu chibai bûk naw bawk kan tih,” an ta."
19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.","Chun, Nebukadnezzar chu lunginsennain a sip a, a hmêl umzie chu Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego chunga chun a hung danglam tah a; chuleiin, a hril a, meithuk chu a lum hlak ang let saria suklum dingin thu a pêk tah a."
20,"And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.","Chun, a sipai pâwl laia mi- hrâttakhai chu Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego chu khuop a, meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka chun pei lût dingin thu a pêk a."
21,"Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.","Chun, chuong mihai chu an kekawrhai, an lukâwmhai, an kawr- fuolhai le an silfên danghaia chun khuopa umin meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka peiin an um tah a."
22,"Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.","Chuongchun, lal thupêk chu a nasa êm a, meithuk chu a lum kher lei chun meichawk chun Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego pei lûttuhai chu a sukhlum tah a."
23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.","Chun, chuong mi pathum, Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego chu khuop hlawm saa umin meithuk chawklai râpthlâktaka chun an tla lût tah a."
24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.","Chun, lal Nebukadnezzar chun mak a ti ta hleh a, inhmawtakin a tho a, a rorêltuhai chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Mi pathum kha khuop sain mei lai ei pei lût a ni naw am a ni kha?” a ta. Anni chun an dawn a, lal kuoma chun, “Aw lalpa, pei e,” an ta."
25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.","Ama chun a dawn a, “En ta u, mei laia khun mi pali sût sain inlawnin ka hmuh a, na hrim an ti nawh; a palina hmêl putzie chu pathienhai naupa ang a nih,” a ta."
26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.","Chun, Nebukadnezzar chu mei- thuk chawklai râpthlâktak bula chun a hung hnai a, “Sadrak, Mesak, Abednego, nangni Pathien Chung- hnungtak siehlawhai, hung suok unla, hi tieng hin hung ro,” tiin a biek a. Chun, Sadrak, Mesak le,Abednego chu mei laia inthawk chun an hung suok tah a."
27,"And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.","Chun, biel awptuhai, ram awp- tuhai, sipai hotuhai le lal rorêltuhai hung inkhâwmhai chun chuong mihai chu an taksahai chunga chun meiin thilthawtheina a nei nawh a, an lua sam khawm chu a kângkin nawh a, an zakuohai khawm chu a danglam chuong nawh a, anni chu mei rim khawm an innam nawh ti chu an hmuh a."
28,"Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.","Chun, Nebukadnezzar chun a hril a, “Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai Pathien, a vântirko hung tir a, a siehlaw ama ringtuhai hung san- himtu chu inpâkin um raw se; lal thuhai chu a hung sukdanglam a, an Pathien chau naw chu pathien dang hrim hrim chu a rawng an bâwla chibai an bûk nawna dingin an taksahai chu a humpêk tah a."
29,"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.","Chuleichun, thupêk ka siem, mi tin, hnam tin, le ṭawng tin, hieng Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai Pathien chunga thil hril suol taphawt chu, sât nawi vawng nîng an ta, an inhai khawm chu êk siekhâwmnaa siem nîng a tih; hieng ang kawnga mi sanhim thei pathien dang hrim an um naw leiin,” a ta."
30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.","Chun, Babulon biel sûnga chun lal chun Sadrak, Mesak le Abednego hai chu a siem lien tah a."
