1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.","Juda lal Jehoiakim rorêl kum thumnaa Babulon ram lal Nebu- kadnezzar chu Jerusalemah a hung a, a rûn tah a."
2,"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.","Chun, Juda lal Jehoiakim chu Pathien ina bûr le bêl ṭhenkhat leh Lalpa chun ama kuta chun a pêk tah a; Sinar rama a pathien ina chun a lâk a, chuong bûr le bêlhai chu a pa- thien sum ina chun a hung lâk tah a."
3,"And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles;","Chun, lal chun a mitillâkhai chunga hotu Aspenaz kuoma chun Israel nauhai mi ṭhenkhat lal chi ngei le miṭha chi ngei hung ṭhuoi dingin a hril a;"
4,"youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.","anni chu tleirâwl demkailo, ditumtak lem, varna po poa thiem, hrietna kawnga bengvâr, hrietna inthûktak hre mi, lal ina ngîr dinga theina nei mi an ni ding a na; chun, Kaldai ṭawng le thiemna ân chûktir bawk ding a nih."
5,"And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king.","Lal chun kum thum sûng a châwm a, a tâwpa chun lal hmaa an ngîr theina dingin lal bu fâk le a uoin dâwn ngei chu ni tina an chanpuol dingin anni chu a ruotpêk a."
6,"Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.","Hieng hai laia Juda nauhai chu Daniel, Hanania, Misael le Azaria an nih."
7,"And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.","Chun, mitillâk hotu chun anni chu hming tharhai a pêk a; Daniel chu Beltesazzar ân bûk a, Hanania chu Sadrak, Misael chu Mesak, Azaria chu Abednego."
8,"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.","Nisienlakhawm, Daniel chun a lungrilin lal bu fâk le a uoin dâwnhai chun ama chu insukpawrche lo a tum tlat a: chuongchun, mitillâkhai hotu kuoma chun ama chu ân sukpawrche naw theina ding kawng chu a hni a."
9,Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.,"Chun, Pathien chun Daniel chu mitillâkhai hotu mithmua lungin- sietna le ditsakna hlaw thei dingin a siem a."
10,"And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.","Chun, mitillâkhai hotu chun Daniel kuoma chun, “Lal, in dâwn ding le in bu fâk ding ruotpêktu cheu ka lalpa chu ka ṭi a nih, i kum inangpui tleirâwl danghai nêka se lemin i hmêl chu a hmu si naw ding am a nih? Chuong a ni chun, lal kuomah ka lu hi ṭitumtakah i sie a ni ding a nih,” a ta."
11,"Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:","Daniel chun mitillâkhai hotuin anni Daniel, Hanania, Misael le Azaria vêngtu dinga a ruot, Ham- melzar kuoma chun,"
12,"Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.","“Ka ngên che hi, i siehlawhai hi ni sâwm sûng ensin raw khai; fâk dingin thlai chau le dâwn dingin tui chau mîn pêktir la."
13,"Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s dainties; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.","Chun, tleirâwl dang lal bu fâk fahai hmêlput dân le, keini hmêlput dânhai chu enkhi ni raw se; chun, chutaka i hmu ang ang chun, i sie- hlawhai hi i law law law el rawh,” a ta."
14,"So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.","Chuongchun, hi chungchâng thuah anni thu chu a ngai a, ni sâwm sûng chu a ensin tah a."
15,"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king’s dainties.",Ni sâwm hnunga chun tleirâwl dang lal bu fâk fatuhai po po nêk chun an hmêlput dânhai chu a hung inlang ṭha lem tah a.
16,"So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.","Chuongchun, anni vêngtu chun an bu fâk ding le uoin an dâwn ding chu a sie hmang a, thlai chau a pêk lem tah a."
17,"Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.","Chun, hieng tleirâwlhai pali hi Pathien chun varna le thiemna po poa bengvarna le hrietna a pêk a; chun, Daniel chun thilhmulâwkhai le manghai chung po poa chun hriet- thiemna a nei a."
18,"And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.","Chun, lalin anni hung ṭhuoi- lûtna dinga a ruot nihai tâwpa chun mitillâkhai hotu chun anni chu Nebukadnezzar hmaa chun a hung ṭhuoi tah a."
19,"And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.","Lal chun anni chu a lo biek tâwl a, an rênga lai chun Daniel hai, Hanania hai, Misael hai le Azaria hai ang tukhawm an um nawh a, chulei- in, anni chu lal hmaa chun an ngîr tah a."
20,"And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.","Chun, varna le hrietthiemna kawng tinrêngah, lalin a indawn ta hrim hrima chun, a ram sûnga aisân- thiemhai le mitvaidawi thiemhai po po nêka le sâwma var lemin anni chu a hriet a."
21,And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.,"Chun, Daniel lem chu Kura inlal kum khatna chenin a um zing tah a."
