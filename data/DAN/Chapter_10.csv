1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.","Persia lal Kura inlal kum thumnaa chun a hming Belte- sazzar inbûk, Daniel kuomah thil suklangin a um a, chu thil chu thil indik, indona ropuitak a na, chu thil chu a hriet a, thilhmulâwk chu hriet- thiemna a nei bawk a."
2,"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.",Chuong nihai lai chun kei Daniel hi hapta thum zet chu lungngaiin ka um a.
3,"I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.","Bei inhnikin ka fâk nawh a, sa le uoin hrim hrim khawm ka bauah a lût nawh a, hriek hrim hrim khawm kân nâl ngai nawh a, hapta thum pumhlûm a tling hmakhat chun."
4,"And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,","Chun, thla hmasatak ni sâwmhni pali ni chun, Hiddekel vadung ropui- tak panga ka um lai chun,"
5,"I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz:","ka mithai vân tieng ka hang inlên a, ka en a, mi pakhat puon zai inhmia inthuom, a kâwnga Uphaz rângka- chak inthienga inkhit hi ka hmuh a;"
6,"his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.","a taksa khawm chu berul lung ang a na, a hmêl inlang dân chu kâwlinlep ang a na, a mithai chu khâwnvar chawklai ang an na, a kuthai le a kehai chu dârsen tlemi ang an na, a thu hril rihai chu mi tamtak râwlri ang a nih."
7,"And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.","Chun, kei Daniel chau chun chu thilhmulâwk chu ka hmuh a; ka kâwla mi um vehai chun thilhmu- lâwk chu an hmu ve nawh a; ami- ruokchu, inthinna nasatak an chung- ah a tlah a, anni chu inbi dingin an tlân tah a."
8,"So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.","Chuongchun, ka khât chaua mâksanin ka um a, hi thilhmulâwk ropuitak hi ka hmu tah a; chun, keimaa chun hrâtna hrim hrim a um ta nawh a: ka hmêl mawina chu sietnaa ân chang ta leiin, hrâtna hrim ka nei ta nawh a."
9,"Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.","A thuhril ri chu ka la hriet ta rawp a: chun, a thuhril ri chu ka hriet phingleh, hnuoitienga ka hmai in- nghatin ka bawkkhup a, inhniktakin ka in tah a."
10,"And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.","Chun, ngai ta, kutin a mi hung them a, chuongchun, dingṭhaṭhuonin ka bawkinvâk a."
11,"And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Aw nang nasataka ditsaka umpa Daniel, i kuoma ka thuhrilhai chu a ngaina hre la, ngîr inzang rawh; tuhin i kuoma hung tir ka ni sih a,” a ta. Hi thu hi ka kuoma a hung hril phing chun inthin pumin ka ngîr tah a."
12,"Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words’ sake.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Daniel ṭi naw rawh, i Pathien hmaa nang le nang în sukhnuoi a, a ngaina hre dinga i lungril i siem nia inthawk khan i thuhai chu hriet a lo ni tah a, i thuhai lei chun hi ka hung a nih."
13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.","Nisienlakhawm, Persia ram lal chun ni sâwmhni pakhat sûng chu a mi lo dangkîr a; amiruokchu, ngai ta, Mikael hotu laia lutak pakhat chu kei mi ṭhangpui dingin a hung a; chuong- chun, Persia ram lalhai le chun chutaka chun ka um zing tah a."
14,Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days.,"Ni nuhnungahai chun i mihai chu iengin am a hung tlâkbuok ding a na ti inhriettir ding chein tuhin ka hung a nih; thilhmulâwk kha ni tamtakhaia ding a la ni chau sih a,” a ta."
15,"And when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.","Chun, hieng thuhai ang peia ka kuoma thu a hung hril chun, ka hmai chu hnuoi tieng ka kûn a, ṭawng- theiloin ka um tah a."
16,"And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat, mi- hriem naupahai angtak el hin ka hmûrhai chu a hung them a; chun, ka bau chu ka kah a, ka hmaa ngîr kuoma chun thu ka hril tah a, “Aw ka lalpa, thilhmulâwk lei chun ka lung- ngainahai chu ka chungah a tla tah a, chuongchun, hrâtna hrim ka nei dêr ta nawh."
17,"For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.","Hi ka lalpa siehlaw hin hi ka lalpa kuoma hin iengtin am thu hril thei ka ta? Kei hlak chu kârloin hrâtna hrim nei loin ka um el sih a, keimaa chun inthuokna hrim hrim khawm a um ta bawk si nawh a,” ka tih a."
18,"Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.","Chun, mihriem hmêl angtak put pakhat hin a mi hung them nâwk a; a mi sukhrât tah a."
19,"And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.","Ama chun, “Aw nasataka dit- saka umpa, ṭi naw rawh, i kuomah thlamuongna um raw se; insukhrât rawh, anih, insukhrât rawh,” a ta. Chun, ka kuoma thu a hung hril phing chun sukhrâtin ka um tah a, “Ka lalpa hin thu hril raw se, i mi sukhrât ta sih a,” ka ta."
20,"Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.","Chun, ama chun, “I kuomah iengdinga hung am ka na ti i hriet am? Tuhin Persia lal chu do dingin kîr nâwk ka ta; chun, ka fe suok pha chun, ngai ta, Grik ram lal chu hung a tih."
21,"But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.","Nisienlakhawm, thudik ziek- naa ziek chu hril ka ti che: hi thil chungchâng thua hin, i lalpa Mikael ti chau naw chu tukhawm a mi ṭan zo hrim hrim an um nawh."
