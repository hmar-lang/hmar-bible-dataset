1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.","Lal Belsazzar rorêl a kum thum- naa chun thil hmulâwkhai, a hmaa ka kuoma hung inlang hnunga khan, ka kuomah, kei Daniel kuoma ngei a hung inlang a."
2,"And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.","Chun, thil hmulâwka chun ka hmuh a; Hieng ang hi a lo nih a, thilhmulâwk ka hmu lai chun, Elam rama lal in, Susaa chun ka lo um a; thil hmulâwka chun ka hmuh a; Ulai vadung kâwlah ka lo um a."
3,"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.","Chun, ka mit ka hang meng a, ngai ta, vadung kâwla chun berâmchal ki pahni nei a ngîr ka hmuh a; chu kihai pahni chu ân sâng hleh a; ami- ruokchu, a ki pakhat chu a dang nêk chun ân sâng lem a; ân sâng lem chu a hung suok nuhnung lem chu a na."
4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.","Berâmchal chu thlangtieng le, hmârtieng le, simtieng chu panin ka hmuh a; a hmaa hrim hrim chun ramsa dang ngîr thei an um nawh a, a kuta inthawka la dawk thei hrim hrim khawm tukhawm an um nawh a; chuongchun, a nuom ang angin a thawh a, ama le ama chu ân chawi- mawi tah a."
5,"And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.","Chun, ka ngaituo lai chun, ngai ta, hnuoi chung po po dâpin thlang- tienga inthawkin kêlchal a hung a, hnuoi hrim hrim a tâwk nawh a; chun, kêl chun a mithai inkâra chun ki maktak el a nei a."
6,"And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.","Chun, berâmchal ki pahni nei, vadung kâwla ngîr ka hmu kuoma chun a hung a; chuongchun, a theipa- tâwpin ama chu a baw tah a."
7,"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.","Chun, berâmchal hnaia hung chu ka hmuh a, a chunga chun lung- insentakin a châng a; berâmchal chu a sik a, a kihai pahni chu a suktliek tah a; ama hmaa ngîr dingin berâm- chala chun thilthawtheina hrim a um nawh a; chuleiin, hnuoi chungah a tethlûk a, ama chu sirdein a chîl a; chuongchun, ama kuta inthawka berâmchal sansuok thei hrim hrim chu an um nawh a."
8,"And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.","Chun, kêlchal chu ama le ama nasatakin ân chawimawi a, a hrât hle lai chun a ki ropuitak chu a tliek tah a; a aia chun vân thli palihai tienga chun ki maktak pali a hung suok a."
9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.","Anni laia pakhata inthawk chun ki chitê a hung suok a, chu chu sim- tieng le, saktieng le ram ropui tieng chun ropuitakin a hung um tah a."
10,"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.","Chun, vân mipuihai laia khawm chun a hung ropui hleh a; chuong- chun, pâwl ṭhenkhat le arasi ṭhen- khat chu hnuoiah a pei thlâk a, anni a sirde tah a."
11,"Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual burnt-offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.","Anih, mipuihai lal kuoma ngei khawm chun ama le ama chu ân chawimawi a; pumrawhmanga in- thawina zing zinghai chu amaa inthawkin a lâk hmang a; a Hmun Inthiengtak chu a pei thlâkpêk a."
12,"And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.","Chun, bawsietna leia pumraw- hmanga inthâwina inhlân zing zingna le chun mipuihai chu a kuoma pêk a ni tah a. Thudik chu hnuoiah a peithlâk a, a nuom nuom a thawh a, a hlawtling bawk a."
13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?","Chun, mi inthieng pakhat thu- hril ka hriet a; chun, mi inthieng dangin tu amanih thuhriltu kuoma chun, “Mipuihai le Hmun Inthieng- tak sirdea um ve ve dinga pêk ding le, sukrêmtu bawsietna le, pumraw- hmang thilinhlân zing zing chung- thua thil hmulâwk hi ieng chen am nîng a ta?” a ta."
14,"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Zân- tienghai le zîngtienghai sâng hni za thum chen nîng a tih; chun, Hmun Inthiengtak chu sukthieng nîng a tih,” a ta."
15,"And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.","Chun, kei Daniel ngei hin, hre dinga ka izawng thilhmulâwk chu ka hmu tah a; chun, ngai ta, ka hmaa chun mihriem hmêlput hi a hung ngîr a."
16,"And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.","Chun, mihriem râwl hi Ulai vapanghai inkâra chun ka hriet a, chu râwl chu a khêk a, “Gabriel, hi mipa hi thil hmulâwk kha inhriettir rawh,” a ta."
17,"So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.","Chuongchun, ka ngîrna hmun kâwla chun a hung hnai a; chun, a hung hnai chun ka ṭih a, ka bawk- khup tah a; nisienlakhawm, ka kuoma chun, “Aw mihriem naupa, thil hmulâwkhai chu hun tâwpa ding a nih ti hi hre rawh,” a ta."
18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.","Ka kuoma thu a hril lai chun ka hmai chu hnuoi tieng innghatin in- hniktakin ka in a; nisienlakhawm, a mi them a, a mîn tungtho tah a."
19,"And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.","Ama chun, “Ngai ta, lunginsen- na hun tâwp tieng hun nuhnunga thil um ding chu inhriettir ka ti che, a tâwpna hunbi ruota ṭhang ding chu a ni sih a."
20,"The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.",Berâmchal ki pahni nei i hmu kha Media le Persia lalhai an na.
21,And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.,"Kêlchal nunsetak kha Grik ram lal a nih; chun, a mithai kâra ki ropuitak kha lal hmasatak chu a nih."
22,"And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.","Chun, a tliek a, a hmuna pali hung suok kha, chu hnama inthawk chun lal pali hung ngîrsuok an ta; nisienlakhawm, a thilthawtheina le chu ni naw ni."
23,"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.","Chun, an ram hun nuhnung tienga, bawsetuhai an hung puitling pha chun lal hmêl ṭiumtak, thu khir- tak takhai hre thei hung ngîrsuok a ta."
24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do his pleasure; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.","A thilthawtheina chu hrâttak nîng a ta, nisienlakhawm, ama thil- thawtheina hran ngat chu ni naw ni; râpthlâktakin suksieng a ta, hlaw- tling a ta, a nuom nuom thaw bawk a tih; mi inthienghai le mi hrâttakhai chu sukse bawk a tih."
25,"And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in their security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.","A remruot dân hmangin a kuta chun vervêkna chu inhlawtlingtir a ta; a lungrila chun ama le ama chu inchawimawi a tih; chun, an inring naw kârin mi tamtak chu suksieng a ta, lalhai lal chungah ngîrsuok bawk a ta, nisienlakhawm, kut loa suksiet nîng a tih."
26,And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.,"Chun, zântienghai le zîngtieng- hai thilhmulâwka thil hril chu ân dik a nih; nisienlakhawm, thil hmulâwk chu la khâr hri phawt rawh; ni la hung tlung ding tamtakhai ta ding chu a ni sih a,” a ta."
27,"And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.","Chun, kei Daniel chu ka châu a, ni iengzât amani chu ka damnawh a; chun, ka tho a, lal sin chu ka thaw tah a: nisienlakhawm, thilhmulâwka chun mak ka ti êm êm a, tukhawma an hriet thiem si nawh a."
