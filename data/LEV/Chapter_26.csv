14,"But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;","“Amiruokchu, ka thu in pawm nawh a, hieng ka thupêkhai po po hi in zâwm nawh a;"
15,"and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;","ka thuruothai in dit nawh a, in hringnain ka rorêlhai chu a theidah a, ka thupêkhai po po zâwm loa ka thuthlung in bawsiet chun,"

23,"And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;","“Chuong sa khawma ka thu- nunna chu in pawm nawh a, a mi kal zâwnga in la um ta rawp chun,"
24,"then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.","kei khawm nangni kal zâwngin um ka ta, keima ngeiin in suolhai leiin a let sariin hrem ka ti cheu."
25,"And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.","In chungah kâwlhnâm inlêngtir ka ta; chu chun thuthlung phuba chu lâng a ta, mâni khaw sûng sengah intawm khâwm in tih; chun, nangni lai hri inlêngtir ka ta, hmêlmahai kutah pêk nîng in tih."

27,"And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;","“Chuong sa khawma ka thu in pawm nawh a, a mi kalzâwnga in la um ta rawp chun,"
28,then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.,lunginsentakin nangni kal zâwngin um ka ta; in suol leiin a let sariin hrem bawk ka ti cheu.

30,"And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.","In bâwlhmunhai sukchim ka ta, in milimhai sukthlûng ka ta, in ruonghai chu in milimhai chungah pei ka ta; chun, ka hringna khawmin a theida ding cheu a nih."
31,"And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.","In khuohai chu sukrêm ka ta, in hmun inthienghai chu sukrêm bawk ka tih; in rim inhnikhai khawm chu inhnam naw bawk ka tih."
32,And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.,In ram chu sukrêm ka ta; in hmêlma chutaka umhai chun mak tîng an tih.
33,"And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.","Hnam danghai laia chun suk- dar ka ti cheu a, a hnawt ding cheuin kâwlhnâm chu phawi ka ta, chuong- chun, in ramhai chu sukrêm nîng a ta, in khuohai chu ṭâwp a tih."
34,"Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.","“Ram chu sukrêma a um sûng po le, in hmêlmahai rama in um sûng chun, ram chun châwlnihai chu hlimtakin hmang a tih; chuongchun, ram chu châwl a ta, a châwlnihai chu hlimtakin hmang a tih."
35,"As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.","Sukrêma a um sûng po chun châwl a ta, in um laia châwlnia châwl ngai lo kha."
36,"And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.","Chun, nangni laia mi la um- sunhai chu, an hmêlmahai ramah an lungrilah thlabârna inumtir ka ta; hnaṭâwng inlêng riin anni hnawt a ta, kâwlhnâma inthawka tlânsie angin tlânsieng an ta, tu ihnawt dêr loin tlûng an tih."
37,"And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.",Tu ihnawt loin kâwlhnâma hnawt ang elin inpalthlu rem rum an ta; in hmêlmahai lo dang dingin hrâtna hrim hrim nei naw ti niu.
38,"And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.","Hnam danghai lai chun bo- hmang in ta, in hmêlmahai ram chun fa zo a ti cheu."
39,And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.,"Chun, nangni laia mi la umsunhai chu in hmêlmahai ramah an rîtlona leiin rêm tiel tiel an ta; an pi le puhai chun an rîtlona an rêm pha angin, anni khawmin rêm pha bawk an tih."
40,"And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,","“An suol, ka chunga an suolna lei le, an rîtlona le an pi le puhai rît- lona leh, a mi kal zâwnga an um leia"
41,"I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;","kei khawm anni kalzâwnga ka um a, an hmêlmahai rama ka înumtir chu: an lungril tan lo chu an insuk- hnuoi a, an rîtlonaa inthawka an insiem ṭha chun;"
42,"then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.","Jakob kuoma ka thuthlung chu hre zing ka ta, Isak le Abraham kuoma ka thuthlung khawm hre zing ka ta; ram khawm chu hre zing bawk ka tih."
43,"The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.","Ram khawm chu inkiengsan an ta, anni um loa a rêm sûng chun a châwlnihai chu hlimtakin hmang a tih; ka rorêlnahai an dit naw lei le, ka thuruothai an hringna chun a theida hlak leia an rîtlona chun insiem ṭhâng an tih."
44,"And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;","Nisienlakhawm, chuonghai po po leia an hmêlmahai rama an um sûng khawm chun, anni sukbo- hmang dêr ding le anni le ka thuthlung chu sukse dingin anni chu pei thla naw ningah, theida naw bawk ka tih; kei hi LALPA an Pathien chu ka ni sih a;"
45,"but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.","amiruokchu, an Pathien ka ni theina dinga, hnam tinhai mithmua Aigupta rama inthawka ka ṭhuoi suok, an thlatuhai le thuthlung chu, anni lei hin hre zing lem ka tih: Kei hi LALPA chu ka nih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
46,"These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.","Hienghai hi, Sinai tlânga Mosie hmanga ama le Israel thlahai inkâra LALPAIN a siem thuruothai, rorêlhai le dânhai chu an nih."
