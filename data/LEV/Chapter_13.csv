1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie le Aron a biek a,"
2,"When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:","“Mi a tisa vun ân vûng amanih, ân khir amanih, a puor amaniha, a vuna chun inphâr hri ni âwma ân lang chun thiempu Aron kuoma manih, a naupasal thiempuhai pa- khat phawt phawt kuoma ṭhuoi ding a nih."
3,"and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.","Thiempu chun tisa vuna hri chu lo en a ta; a hri umna lai hmul chu a hung vâr a, a hri chu tisa vun nêka inthûka ân lang chun inphârna hri a nih a; thiempu chun ama chu en a ta, mi inthieng naw a ni chu a phuong ding a nih."
4,"And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:","A tisa vuna puorhai chu a hung vâr a, vun nêka inthûk lema ân lang nawh a, a hmul chu a vâr naw chun, hri invawitu chu thiempu chun ni sari khum a tih;"
5,"and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:","thiempu chun ni sari ni chun ama chu en a ta, a hri chu a pângngai zinga a hmuh a, a hri chu vuna chun a lo indar lien chuong naw chun, ni sari ma khum nâwk a tih."
6,"and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.","Chun, thiempu chun ni sari ni chun en nâwk a ta; hri chu a lo duk a, vuna chun a lo indar lien naw chun, thiempu chun ân thieng a nih ti phuong a tih; inkhir el a nih a, a puonhai sâwp a ta, inthieng hung ni tâng a tih."
7,"But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again:","Amiruokchu, a inthienna dinga thiempu ân entir hnunga a khir chu vuna chun a lo indar lien chun, thiem- pu chu ân entir nâwk ding a nih."
8,"and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.","Chun, thiempu chun lo en a ta, a khir chu vuna chun a lo indar lien chun, thiempu chun inthieng naw a nih ti phuong a tih; inphâr a nih."
9,"When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;",“Inphârna hri miin a kâwl chun thiempu kuoma ṭhuoi ding a nih.
10,"and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,","Thiempu chun lo en a ta, vuna chun a vâra a hung invûng suok a, a hmul chu a hung sukvâr a, ân vûng- naa chun tisa châr a hung inlang chun,"
11,"it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up; for he is unclean.","a tisa vuna inphârna hri det lo um zing tah a nih; thiempu chun inthieng naw a nih ti phuong a ta, khum hran chuong naw nih, in- thieng naw a ni leiin."
12,"And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest;","A phârna chu a vuna chun ân dar lien a, a hri invawitu chu a lua inthawka a ke lêr chena thiempu hriet thei tâwka inphârnain a bâwm chun,"
13,"then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.","thiempu chun en a ta, inphârna chun a tisa po po chu a bâwm suok ta chun, hri invawitu chu ân thieng a nih ti a phuong ding a nih; a vâr zo tah a, ân thieng tah a nih."
14,"But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.","Amiruokchu, tisa châr a hung inlang chun ân thieng naw a nih."
15,"And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.","Thiempu chun tisa châr chu en a ta, ân thieng nawh ti a phuong ding a nih; tisa châr chu ân thieng naw a nih a, inphârna a nih."
16,"Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest;","Amiruokchu, tisa châr chu a hung danglam nâwk a, a hung vâr nâwk chun thiempu kuomah fêng a ta;"
17,"and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.","thiempu chun lo en a ta; a hri chu a hung vâr chun, thiempu chun hri invawitu chu ân thieng a nih ti a phuong ding a nih, ân thieng tah a nih."
18,"And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed,","“Tisa vun chu a hung khuoihli a, a hung dam a,"
19,"and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be showed to the priest;","khuoihli umna hmuna chun a hung vâr pâwng amanih, vâr sen deua a hung puor amani khawmin, thiempu inentir ding a nih."
20,"and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil.","Thiempu chun lo en a ta, vun nêka inthûka ân lang a, a hmul chu a hung vâr chun, thiempu chun in- thiengnaw a nih ti a phuong ding a nih; inphârna hri a na, khuoihlia inthawk chun a hung inṭan a nih."
21,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:","Amiruokchu, thiempu chun a lo en a, hmul vâr a um nawh a, vun nêkin ân thûk nawh a, a duk deu chau a ni chun, thiempu chun ni sari khum hran a ta;"
22,"and if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.","vuna chun a hung indar lien chun, thiempu chun ân thieng nawh ti a phuong ding a nih; hri a nih."
23,"But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.","Amiruokchu, a puor vâr chu a umna ngaiah a um a, a lo indar lien naw chun khuoihli pânser el a na; thiempu chun ân thieng a nih ti a phuong ding a nih."
24,"Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick flesh of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;","“Chun, tisa vun chu a kâng a, a kâng inlâwngna lai chu a vâr sen deu amanih, a vâr amania a hung puor chun,"
25,"then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.","thiempu chun lo en a ta; a puorna lai taka hmul chu a vâr a, vun nêka inthûka ân lang chun, inphârna a na, kângnaa chun a hung inṭan a nih; chuongchun, thiempu chun ân thiengnawh ti a phuong ding a nih, inphâr hri a nih."
26,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:","Amiruokchu, thiempu chun a lo en a, a lo puor a, hmul vâr a um naw chun, vun nêka inthûk loa, a hmuk deu chau a ni chun, thiempu chun ni sari sûng khum hran a ta;"
27,"and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.","chun, thiempu chun ni sari ni chun ama chu en a ta, vuna chun a lo indar lien chun, thiempu chun inthieng naw a nih ti a phuong ding a nih; inphâr hri a nih."
28,"And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.","A puor chu a umna pângngaia chun a um zing a, vuna chun a lo indar lien nawh a, a hmuk deu chau a ni chun, mei kâng ser el a na, thiempu chun ân thieng ti a phuong ding a nih, mei kâng ser el a nih."
29,"And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard,","“Nuhmei khawm, pasal khawm, a lua manih, a khâkhmula manih hri a kai chun,"
30,"then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.","thiempu chun hri chu lo en a ta; chun, vun nêka inthûk lema ân lang a, hmul eng zai inhmitak a um chun thiempu chun inthieng naw a nih ti a phuong ding a nih, inbuotna hri a na, lua manih, khâkhmula maniha inphâr hri a nih."
31,"And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:","Thiempu chun inbuotna hri chu a en a, vun nêka inthûk lema ân lang nawh a, a hmuk dum a um naw chun, thiempu chun inbuotna hri invawitu chu ni sari khum hran a ta;"
32,"and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin,","ni sari niin thiempu chun hri chu en a ta; inbuotna hri chu ân dar lien nawh a, hmul eng khawm a um bawk nawh a, inbuotna hri chu vun nêka inthûk nawha ân lang chun,"
33,"then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:","vaw ding a na, ân buotna lai ruok chu a vaw ding a ni nawh; thiempu chun ama chu ni sari dang khum hran nâwk a tih;"
34,"and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.","chun, thiempu chun ni sari ni chun inbuotna chu en nâwk a ta, inbuotna chu a lo indar lien nawh a, vun nêka inthûka ân lang naw chun, thiempu chun ân thieng ti a phuong ding a nih; chun, a puonhai sâwp a ta, hung inthieng tâng a tih."
35,"But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing,","Amiruokchu, chu inbuotna chu an thien fai hnunga vuna chun a hung indar lien chun,"
36,"then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.","thiempu chun ama chu lo en a ta; chun, inbuotna chu vuna chun a lo indar lien chun, thiempu ta ding chun hmul eng chu zawng kher ngai naw nih a, ân thieng naw a nih."
37,"But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.","Amiruokchu, inbuotna chu a ngai zingin a hmuh a, hmul dum a mâwng chun, inbuotna chu a dam a na, ân thieng a nih; thiempu chun ân thieng ti a phuong ding a nih."
38,"And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;","“Nuhmei amanih, pasal amanih an tisa vuna chun a puor vârṭak a um chun,"
39,"then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin; he is clean.","thiempu chun en a ta, an tisa vuna puor chu a vâr mâwk deu chau a ni chun, a puor mei mei a na, vuna hung inṭan a na, ân thieng a nih."
40,"And if a man’s hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.","“Mi a sam a tla kawl chun lu- kawl a na; nisienlakhawm, ân thieng a nih."
41,"And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; yet is he clean.","Chun, mi a bâwk le a barêp samhai a tla chun bâwk kawl a na; nisienlakhawm, ân thieng a nih."
42,"But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.","Amiruokchu, chu lukawlnaa manih, bâwkkawlnaa manih chun hri sen dâng deu a um chun, a lukawl- naa manih, bâwkkawlnaa maniha hung inṭan inphârna a nih."
43,"Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;","Chuongchun, thiempu chun lo en a ta, a lukawla manih, a bâwk- kawla mani hri chu a sen dâng hlar a, tisa vuna inphârna anga ân lang chun,"
44,"he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.","mi inphâr a na, ân thieng naw a nih; thiempu chun ama chu inthieng naw a nih ti a phuong ngei ding a nih; ân phârna chu a luah a nih."
45,"And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.","“Inphâr hri invawi chu a puon- hai keithlêr nîng a ta, a sam a tlâiin put a ta, a hmûr chungtieng tuom a ta, ‘Inthieng naw, inthieng naw,’ tiin a khêk ding a nih."
46,All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be.,"Inphârnain a bâwm sûng po chu inthieng naw nîng a ta, ân thieng naw a na, a um hran ding a nih; a umna ding chu riebûk puotieng nîng a tih."
47,"The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;","“Silfên khawm, sahmul silfên amanih, puon zai inhmi silfên amani khawm;"
48,"whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;","a phiera phier amanih, a khâwnga khâwng amani khawm; puon zai inhmi amanih, sahmul amani khawm, savun amanih, ieng- khawm savuna siem amanihah in- phârna hri a um a,"
49,"if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest.","chu hri chu silfêna manih, savuna manih, a khâwnga khâwng amanih, a phiera phier amanih, ieng- khawm savuna siem amaniha a hring deuin amanih, a sen deuin amani khawm a hung inlang suok chun, inphâr hri a na, thiempu inentir ding a nih."
50,"And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which hath the plague seven days:","Chun, thiempu chun hri chu en a ta, hri kaina chu ni sari sie hran a ta;"
51,"and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.","ni sari ni chun hri chu en a ta, hri chu silfên a khâwnga khâwng amanih, a phiera phier amanih, ieng ding khawma an ihmang savuna manih ân dar lien chun, hri chu inphârna hri nghettak chi a nih a, ân thieng naw a nih."
52,"And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.","Silfên chu a khâwnga khâwng amanih, a phiera phier amanih, sa- hmul amanih, pat zai inhmi amanih, savuna siem chi tinrêng amanih, inphâr hri umna taphawt chu raw ding a na, inphâr dettak chi a ni sih a, raw ngei ding a nih."
53,"And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;","“Chun, thiempu chun a lo en a, silfên khâwnga manih, phiera manih, savuna siem chi hrim hrima a lo indar lien naw chun,"
54,"then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:","thiempu chun hri umna chu sâwp thu pêng a ta, ni sari dang sie hran nâwk a tih."
55,"and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its color, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without.","Chun, hri umna sâwp hnung chun thiempu chun en nâwk a ta; hri umdân chu a danglam naw chun, hri lo indar lien naw sien khawm, ân thieng chuong naw a nih; inphârna umna chu a hnung khawm ni sien, a hma tieng khawm ni sien i raw ding a nih."
56,"And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:","“Chun, thiempuin a lo en a, sâwp hnunga hri kaina chu a lo da deu chun, chu hmun chu, silfêna mi khawm, savuna mi khawm, khâwnga mi khawm, phîera mi khawm chu kei thlâng a ta;"
57,"and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.","chu, silfêna manih, khâwnga manih, phiera manih, savun thil ienga khawm ân langa an dar lien chun, hri umna chu i raw ding a nih."
58,"And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.","Silfên chu khâwng amanih, phier amanih, savun thil iengkhawm, i sâwp hnunga hri chun ân kieng- san chun, sâwp nâwk ding a na; chuongchun, inthieng hung nîng a tih."
59,"This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.","“Hi hi silfên, sahmul amanih, puon zai inhmi amanih, khâwng amanih, phier amanih, savuna siem thil hrim hrimhaia inphârna hri uma, ân thieng le ân thieng naw phuongna dân ding chu a nih,” tiin."
