26,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
27,"Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.","“Thla sarina ni sâwm ni ruok hi chu intlanna ni a na; in ta dingin inkhâwmpui inthieng nîng a ta, insukrinum in ta: LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlân in inhlân ding a nih."
28,"And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.",Chu ni chun ieng sin khawm in thaw ding a ni nawh: LALPA in Pathien hmaa intlanna siemna dinga intlanna ni a ni sih a.
29,For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.,Tukhawm chu nia insukrinum lo chu a chipuihaia inthawkin tui- thlârin um a tih.
30,"And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.","Tukhawm chu nia sin ieng- khawm thaw taphawt chu, chu mi chu a chipuihaia inthawkin sukbo- hmang ka tih."
31,Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.,Ieng sin khawm in thaw ding a ni nawh; hi hi in chêngna taphawtah in thlahai chena kumkhaw dân ding a nih.
32,"It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.","In ta dinga châwlni ursûntaka inser châwlna nîng a ta, in insuk- rinum ding a nih; chu thla ni kuo ni zântieng, chu zântienga inthawka zântieng nâwk chenin châwlniah in hmang ding a nih,” tiin."
33,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
34,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah.","“Israel thlahai chu hril la, an kuomah, ‘Thla sarina ni sâwmpanga ni le ni sari sûng chu LALPA ta dingin bâwkte ruoiṭhena a nih."
35,On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.,"A ni khatna chu inkhâwmpui inthieng nîng a ta, sin hrim hrim in thaw ding a ni nawh."
36,Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.,"Ni sari sûng chun, mei hmanga thilinhlân LALPA kuomah inhlân in ta, a ni riet ni chu in ta dingin inkhâwmpui inthieng nîng a ta; mei hmanga thilinhlân LALPA kuomah in inhlân ding a nih; inkhâwmpui ursûn a na; sin hrim hrim in thaw ding a ni nawh."
37,"These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;","Hienghai hi an nih LALPA ruoiṭhe hunbi, LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlân dâm, pumraw- hmang thilinhlân dâm, fâkmi thilin- hlân dâm, inthâwinahai dâm, dâwnmi thilinhlân dâm, an ni bîk senga inhlânna dinga inkhâwmpuina inthienga in inser dinghai chu:"
38,"besides the sabbaths of Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah.","LALPA châwlnihai, in thil- pêkhai, in thutiemhai po po le nuom- thua in thilinhlânhai po po bâkah; chuong chu LALPA kuoma in pêk hlak hrim an nih a."
39,"Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.","Thla sarina ni sâwmpanga nia, in lo ra suok in lâk khawm huna chun, LALPA ruoiṭhe chu ni sari inawtir in ta; a ni khat ni chu châwl ṭawk ṭawk ni nîng a ta, a ni riet ni khawm chu châwl ṭawk ṭawk ni ni bawk a tih."
40,"And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days.","A ni khat ni chun thing kûng mawi tak tak rahai, intûm kâuhai, thing inbuktak zârhai, vadunga phahrâm kâuhai chawi in ta, LALPA in Pathien hmaa chun ni sari sûng in insukhlim ding a nih."
41,And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.,Hi hi LALPA kuoma ruoiṭhe angin kum khatah ni sari sûng in hmang ding a nih; in thlahai chena kumkhaw dân ding a nih; thla sarinaah in nei hlak ding a nih.
42,Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;,"Bâwkteah ni sari sûng um in ta, Israel ram mi po po chu bâwkteah in um ding a nih;"
43,"that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.","chuongchun, in thlahai chun, Israel thlahai chu Aigupta rama in- thawka ka ṭhuoi suok lai khan bâwkteah kân umtir ti hre thei an tih: Kei hi LALPA in Pathien chu ka nih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
44,And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, Mosie chun LALPA ruoiṭhe hunbi siemhai chu Israel thlahai lai chun a puong tah a."
