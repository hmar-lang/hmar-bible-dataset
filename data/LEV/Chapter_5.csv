1,"And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.","“Tukhawm a thil hmua manih, a thil hrieta manih hretu a nih a, inkhâmtirtu rawl a hriet khawma hril nuom lotu chun, a hril nuom nawna suola a rîtlona maw chu phur a tih."
2,"Or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty.","Tukhawma thil thiengnaw hrim hrim, ramsa thiengnaw ruong ama- nih, invâka invâk chi ran inthieng- naw ruong amanih hre lo khawmin lo themin hung pawrche ta sienla, thiemnaw chang a tih."
3,"Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.","Mihriem inthiengnawna ieng ang khawm, a thiengnawna hre loa a them pal khawmin, a hriet suok pha chun thiemnaw chang a tih."
4,"Or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these things.","Tukhawma thil ṭha naw amanih, thil ṭha amanih thaw dinga, ieng dâwn loa ṭawng ân khâm zung zung chun, a hriet suok huna chun, ân khâm zung zungna ṭawngbau a ieng ienga khawm chun thiemnaw chang a tih."
5,"And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned:",Hieng thil pakhata khawm hin thiemnaw a chang pha chun a suolna chu inphuong a ta;
6,"and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin.","a thil suol thaw ta leia bawsiet inthâwina dingin, ran ruol laia mi berâmte amanih, kêl amanih suol in- thâwinaa hmang dingin LALPA kuomah hung chawi a ta; thiempu chun a suol leia intlanna siempêk a tih."
7,"And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.","“A neiin berâmte chu a tlin naw ruok chun, LALPA kuoma inhlân dingin, a suol thaw ta leia bawsietna inthâwina dingin; vaṭhu pahni ama- nih, pârvate pahni amanih a hung chawi ding a nih; pakhat chu suol inthâwina dingin, pakhat chu pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin."
8,"And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder:","Thiempu kuoma chun hung chawi a ta; ama chun suol inthâwina ding chu inhlân hmasâng a ta, khawi loin a lu chu a rîngah her bawng a ta;"
9,and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.,suol inthâwina thisen chu mâichâm panga chun tlâwmte thêng a ta; thisen la um po chu mâichâm bula chun infar kangtir ding a nih; chu chu suol inthâwina a nih.
10,"And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.","A pakhat nâwk chu dân angin pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin inhlân a ta, thiempu chun a thil suksuol ta chungchânga chun intlan- na siempêk a ta, ngaidam nîng a tih."
11,"But if his means suffice not for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering.","Amiruokchu, a neiin vaṭhu pahni amanih, pârva te pahni amani khawm a tlin naw chun, a suol mana dingin a thilinhlânah suol inthâwina beiphit inditak epha hmun sâwma ṭhea hmun khat hung chawi a ta; hriek a nâl ding a ni nawh a, a chungah beraw khawm a sie ding a ni nawh, suol inthâwina a ni leiin."
12,"And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering.","Thiempu kuoma chun hung chawi a ta, thiempu chun hriet zingna puola dingin a vei khat lâng a ta, mâichâm chungah LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlân angin a raw ding a nih; chu chu suol inthâwina a nih."
13,"And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and the remnant shall be the priest’s, as the meal-offering.","Chun, chuong thilhai a ieng ieng khawm a lo suksuol ta chung- chângah intlanna siempêk a ta, ngaidam nîng a tih; a la um po chu fâkmi thilinhlân ang bawkin thiempu chanpuol ding nîng a tih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
14,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
15,"If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah; then he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:","“Tukhawmin thil a suksuol a, LALPA thil inthienghai chunga a suol pal chun, a bawsiet inthâwina dingin, a ruol laia mi berâmchal demkailo, hmun inthieng shekel anga tangka shekel iemani zât hua ngai chu, LALPA kuomah a hung kei ding a nih; chu chu bawsiet inthâwina a nih."
16,"and he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven.","Thil inthieng chunga a lo sukdik nawna chu thung a ta, a hmun ngaa ṭheha hmun khat bel a ta, thiempu chu a pêk ding a nih; chun, thiempu chun bawsiet inthâwina berâmchal chun intlanna siempêk a ta, ngaidam nîng a tih."
17,"And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.","“Tukhawmin LALPAIN thu a pêkhai a ieng khawm thawa thil a suksuol chun, hre naw sienla khawm thiemnaw chang hrim hrim a tih; a rîtlona maw chu phur a tih."
18,"And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven.","Berâm ruol laia mi berâmchal demkailo, i ngaia âwmtâwk, bawsiet inthâwina ding chun thiempu kuom- ah a hung kei ding a nih; chun, thiempu chun, hre loa a thaw pal chungchânga chun intlanna siempêk a ta, ngaidam nîng a tih."
19,It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Jehovah.,"Chu chu bawsiet inthâwina a nih, LALPA hmaa thiemnaw chang a ni ngei a nih,” tiin."
