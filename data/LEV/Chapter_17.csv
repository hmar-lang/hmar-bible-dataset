1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,"Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,","“Aron le a naupasalhai le Israel thlahai po po hril la, an kuom- ah, ‘Hi hi LALPA thupêk chu a nih."
3,"What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp,","Israel sûngkuo laia mi hrim hrim, bâwngchal amanih, berâmte amanih, kêl amani khawm ni sien, riebûka manih, riebûk puoa mani thata,"
4,"and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:","LALPA riebûk hmaa LALPA ta dinga thilinhlâna intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bula hung la naw taphawt chu, ama chu thisen insuoa ngai nîng a tih; thisen insuo ngei a na, ama chu a chipuihai laia inthawkin tuithlârin a um ding a nih."
5,"to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto Jehovah.","Chu chu Israel thlahaiin hmun uolaua inthâwina an ithathai an hung chawi theina dingin, LALPA kuom ngeiah, intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bulah thiempu kuoma an hung chawi theina dingin le, LALPA kuoma inremna thilinhlâna an inhlân theina dingin a nih a;"
6,"And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.","Chun, thiempu chun intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bula mâichâm chu thisen chun thêng a ta, a thâu chu LALPA ta dinga rim inhniktaka dingin a raw ding a nih."
7,"And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever unto them throughout their generations.","Lepchie taka umin, khawhrihai chu zuiin an kuomah an inthâwi ta hrim hrim ding a ni nawh,’ Hi hi an thlahai chena an kumkhaw dân ding a nih."
8,"And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,","Chun, an kuomah hril la, Israel sûngkuo laia mi hrim amanih, ram dang mi anni laia khawsahaiin amanih, pumrawhmang thilinhlân amanih, inthâwina amanih ân hlân a,"
9,"and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto Jehovah; that man shall be cut off from his people.","LALPA kuoma inthâwi dinga intuokna puonin kawtkhâr bula hung la lo chu, ama ngei chu a chipuihai laia inthawka tuithlârin a um ding a nih."
10,"And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.","“Chun, tukhawm Israel sûng- kuo laia mi amanih, ram dang mi anni laia khawsa amanih, ieng thisen khawm fa taphawt chu, chu thisen fatu chunga chun ka hmai sukthim ka ta, a chipuihai laia inthawka tuithlârin inumtir ka tih."
11,For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.,“Tisa hringna chu thisena chun a um sih a; in hringna intlanna siem- na dinga mâichâm chunga ka pêk cheu a nih; hringna dinga intlanna siemna chu thisen ngei chu a ni sih a.
12,"Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.","Chuleiin, Israel thlahai kuom- ah, ‘Tukhawma thisen in fâk ding a ni nawh a, ram dang mi nangni laia khawsahai khawmin thisen chu an fâk ding a ni bawk nawh,’ ka ti a nih."
13,"And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who taketh in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.","Chun, Israel thlahai laia mi amanih, ram dang mi anni laia khaw- sain amanih, ramsuoka sa amanih, vate amanih fâk thei a hung phur chun, a thisen chu suksuok a ta, pilvut a vur khum ding a nih."
14,"For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.","“Tisa po po hringna chu thisen chu a ni sih a; chuleiin, Israel thlahai kuoma chun, ‘Ieng sa thisen khawm in fâk ding a ni nawh, tisa po po hringna chu a thisen chu a ni sih a; tukhawm a fa taphawt chu tuithlârin a um ding a nih."
15,"And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.","Chun, mânia thi amanih, sa se amanih fa taphawt chu, chu rama mi hrim amanih, ram dang mi amani khawm ni sienla, a puonhai sâwp a ta, ân sil ding a nih; chun, zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng a ta, chu hnunga chun inthieng hung nîng a tih."
16,"But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.","Ân sâwp nawh a, ân sil naw ruok chun, ama rîtlona maw chu phur a tih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
