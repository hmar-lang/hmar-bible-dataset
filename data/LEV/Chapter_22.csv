2,"Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah.","“Aron le a naupasalhai kuomah hril la, Israel thlahaiin thil inthieng ka kuoma an inhlân laiin insiekieng raw hai se, ka hming sukse rawi an tih. Kei hi LALPA ka nih."
3,"Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah.","An kuomah, ‘In suonhai chena in thlahai po po lai tukhawm inthieng- naw puma Israel thlahaiin LALPA kuoma an inhlân thil inthieng hung hnai taphawt chu keimaa inthawka tuithlârin a um ding a nih. Kei hi LALPA chu ka nih."
4,"What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;","Aron thla tukhawm inphârna amanih, thipût amani chun ân thieng hmakhat chun, thil inthienghai laia mi chu a tâwk taphawt le,"
5,"or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;","tukhawm ama sukpawrche thei, a bawka invâk chi hrim hrim amanih, pawrchena kai thei tâwk taphawt chu,"
6,"the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.","chuong ang tâwktu chu zântieng chen chun inthieng naw nîng a ta; chun, ân sil naw chun thil in- thienghai laia mi chu a fâk ding a ni nawh."
7,"And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.","Nisa a tlâk hnung ruok chun inthieng tâng a ta, chu hnung chun thil inthienghai laia mi khawm chu fa thei tâng a tih; a fâk ding a ni leiin."
8,"That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah.","Insukpawrche dingin mânia thi amanih, sa se amanih a fâk ding a ni nawh. Kei hi LALPA chu ka nih,’ tiin hril rawh."
9,"They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.","Chuleiin, ka thupêk chu an pawm ding a nih, chuong naw chun suol maw chu phurin, anni insuk- pawrchein thi pal rawi an tih: Kei hi LALPA anni sukthiengtu chu ka nih."
10,"There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest’s, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.","“Ram dang miin thil inthieng chu a fâk ding a ni nawh; thiempu kuoma khawsa amanih, inhlawfa amani chun thil inthieng chu a fâk ding a ni nawh."
11,"But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.","Thiempuin ama suma an châwk ruok chun fa thei a tih; chun, a ina pienghai chun a fâk ding chu fa thei an tih."
12,"And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.","Thiempu naunuin ram dang mi a nei chun, thêna thilinhlân, thil in- thienghai laia mi chu a fâk ding a ni nawh."
13,"But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.","Amiruokchu, thiempu naunu chu nau boin hmeithaiin amanih, mâkin amanih a hung um a, a pa in tieng a kir nâwk chun, a nunghâk lai ang bawk khan a pa fâk ding chu fa vêng a tih; nisienlakhawm, ram dang mi chun an fâk ding a ni nawh."
14,"And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.","Mîn hre loa thil inthieng chu a fâk chun, a hmun ngaa ṭheha hmun khat chu sie sâng a ta, thil inthieng chu thiempu a pêk ding a nih."
15,"And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,","Israel thlahai thil inthieng, LALPA kuoma an inhlân chu, thiem- puhai chun an sukpawrche ding a ni nawh a,"
16,"and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.","chuong ang chun, an thil inthienghai fapêkin rîtlona le baw- sietna maw an inphurtir ding a ni nawh; Kei hi LALPA anni sukthieng- tu chu ka ni sih a,’ ti rawh,” tiin."

18,"Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah for a burnt-offering;","“Aron le a naupasalhai le Israel thlahai po po be la, an kuomah, ‘Israel sûngkuo laia mi amanih, Israelhai laia um ram dang mi amanih, tu- khawma thilinhlân thutiemna khawm, nuomthua thilinhlân khawm, LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilinhlâna a hung inhlân pha,"
19,"that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.","pawm tlâk dingin bâwng amanih, berâm amanih, kêl amanih demkailo a chal in inhlân ding a nih."
20,"But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.",Demkai hrim hrim chu in inhlân ding a ni nawh; pawmpêk tlâk cheu a ni âwm si nawh a.
21,"And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.","Tukhawmin thutiem sukpui- tling dingin amanih, mâni nuomthua thilinhlâna dingin amanih, LALPA kuoma inremna thilinhlâna dinga, ran ruol laia amanih, berâm ruol laia mi amanih ân hlân chun, pawm tlâk a ni theina dingin demkai dêrlo a ni ding a nih; demkaina hrim a um ding a ni nawh."
22,"Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah.","A mitdel dâm, a ru tliek dâm, a silawng dâm, inpânna nei dâm, pang inthakna nei dâm, pang inhlip dâm chu LALPA kuomah in inhlân ding a ni nawh a, LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlâna dingin buotsai ding a ni nawh."
23,"Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.","Mâni nuomthua thilinhlâna ding chun, bâwngchal khawm, be- râmte khawm, kut ke sei taluo amanih, tawi taluo amani khawm inhlân thei in tih; thutiemnaa ding ruok chun pawm ni naw nih."
24,"That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto Jehovah; neither shall ye do thus in your land.","A tilmu sukduk amanih, sukpêr amanih, sukkawi amanih, lâk amani chu LALPA kuomah in inhlân ding a ni nawh a; in rama hin chuong ang chu inthâwina dingin in hmang ding a ni bawk nawh."
25,"Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.","Ram dang mihai kuoma in- thawka lain chuong ang laia mi hrim hrim chu in Pathien fâk ding thilinhlânah in inhlân ding a ni nawh, chuonga chun sietna le dem- kaina a um lei chun, pawmpêk thei cheu ni naw ni,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
26,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
27,"When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.","“Bâwngchal amanih, berâm amanih, kêl amanih a hung piengin, a pui kuomah ni sari a um ding a nih; ni riet nia inthawka hnung tieng chun LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilin- hlânah pawm thei nîng a tih."
28,"And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.","Bâwngpui amanih, berâmpui amanih, a tê leh ni khat sûng in that ding a ni nawh."
29,"And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.","Lâwmthu hrilna inthâwia LALPA kuoma in inthâwi pha, pawm tlâk in ni theina dingin in inthâwi ding a nih."
30,On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah.,"Chu ni chun fâk zo ding a na, a zînga chena dingin iengkhawm in khêk ding a ni nawh: Kei hi LALPA chu ka nih."
31,"Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah.","“Chuleiin, ka thupêkhai hi in pawmin in zâwm ding a nih: Kei hi LALPA chu ka nih."
32,"And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you,","Chun, ka hming inthieng hi in suksiet ding a ni nawh a, Israel thlahai laia chun chawimawiin ka um ding a nih;"
33,"who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah.","Kei hi nangni sukthiengtu in Pathien ni dinga Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu cheu ka nih: Kei hi LALPA chu ka nih,” tiin."
