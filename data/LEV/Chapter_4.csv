1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them:","“Israel thlahai chu hril la, an kuomah, ‘LALPAIN thawlo dinga thu a ipêkhaia hin, a ienga khawm miin suksuol palin, a ieng ieng khawm hi lo thaw ta sienla,"
3,"if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto Jehovah for a sin-offering.","a suksuoltu chu hriek nâla um thiempu a nih a, mipuihai chungah thiemnaw inchangna ân tlungtir chun, a thil suksuol tah suol in- thâwina ding chun, LALPA kuomah bâwng tuoi demkailo inhlân raw se."
4,"And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah.","Bâwng chu intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bulah LALPA hmaa chun hung kei a ta, a lu chungah a kut innghat a ta, LALPA hmaah bâwng chu a that ding a nih."
5,"And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting:","Hriek nâla um thiempu chun bâwng thisen ieng zât amani chu lâng a ta, intuokna puon ina chun hung chawi a ta;"
6,"and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary.","thiempu chun thisena chun a kutpâr inchieng a ta, hmun inthieng puonzâr hmaa chun, LALPA hmaah vawi sari thêng a tih."
7,"And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.","Chun, thiempu chun a ṭhen chu LALPA hmaah, intuokna puon ina riminhniktak mâichâm kihaia chun thisen chu tlâwmte nâl a tih; chun, bâwngchal thisen la um po chu intuokna puon in kawtkhâr kâwla pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâi- châm bula chun a bunthlâk ding a nih."
8,"And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,","Chun, suol inthâwina bâwngchal thâu po po chu la vawng a ta, a sûng thâu le a rîlbawtu po po leh,"
9,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away,","a kal pahnihai le a tuomtu duorda a diemnêma mi le a kalhai pumin a thin tuomtu duorda le chun,"
10,as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering.,"inremna thilinhlânna bâwng- chala mi angin phawr vawng a ta, thiempu chun pumrawhmang thilin- hlânna mâichâma chun a raw ding a nih."
11,"And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,","Chun, bâwngchal vun le, a sa po po le, a lu le, a kehai le, a sûnghai le a êk leh;"
12,"even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.","bâwngchal pumpui el chu, rie- bûk puotieng hmun faiah vut bunthlâkna hmuna chun hung lâng a ta, thing chungah meiin a raw ding a nih; vuthai bunthlâkna hmun ngeia chun raw a ni ding a nih."
13,"And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty;","“Chun, Israel mi po poin an suksuol pal a, mipui mithmua thupa umin, LALPAIN thaw lo dinga thu a pêkhai, a ieng khawm chu an thawh a, thiemnaw an chang a,"
14,"when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.","an thil suksuol chu hriet suok a ni chun, mipuiin suol inthâwina ding- in bâwng tuoi inhlân an ta; intuokna puon in tuola chun an hung kei ding a nih."
15,And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and the bullock shall be killed before Jehovah.,"Chun, mipuihai upahai chun LALPA hmaah bâwng lu chunga chun an kuthai innghat an ta, bâwng chu LALPA hmaa chun that ding a nih."
16,And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting:,"Chun, hriek nâla um thiempu chun intuokna puon ina chun bâwng thisen aṭhen chu hung chawi a ta;"
17,"and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil.","thiempu chun thisena chun a kutpâr inchieng a ta, puonzâr bulah LALPA hmaa vawi sari a the ding a nih."
18,"And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.","Chun, thisen aṭhen chu intuok- na puon inah LALPA hmaah mâi- châm kia chun nâl a ta, thisen la um po chu intuokna puon in kawtkhâr kâwlah pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâichâm bula chun a bunthlâk ding a nih."
19,"And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar.","A thâu po po chu la vawng a ta, mâichâma chun a raw ding a nih."
20,"Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.","Chuong ang chun bâwng chu thâwng a ta; suol inthâwina bâwng a thaw ang charin hi khawm hi a thaw ding a nih; chun, thiempu chun intlanna siempêk a ta, ngaidam ni tâng an tih."
21,"And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin-offering for the assembly.","Chun, bâwng chu khawhnâwm tieng fepui a ta, bâwng hmasa a raw ang khan a raw ding a nih; chu chu mipuihai ta dinga suol inthâwina a nih."
22,"When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty;","“Rorêltuin thil a suksuol a, LALPA a Pathienin thaw lo dinga thu a pêkhai po po kha a ieng ieng khawm a thaw pal a, thiemnaw a chang a,"
23,"if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish.","a thilsuol thaw chu inhriettir a ni chun a thilinhlânah kêlchal, demkailo hung kei a ta;"
24,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering.","kêl lu chunga chun a kut in- nghat a ta, LALPA hmaa pumraw- hmang thilinhlân an thatna hlaka chun a that ding a nih; chu chu suol inthâwina a nih."
25,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering.","Chun, thiempu chun suol inthâwina thisen chu a kutpârin tlâwmte lâng a ta, pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâichâm kihaia chun nâl a ta, pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâichâm bula chun a thisen la um po chu a bunthlâk ding a nih."
26,"And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven.","A thâu po po chu intlanna thilinhlân inthâwina thâu a raw angin mâichâma chun a raw ding a nih; chun, a suol chungchâng thua chun thiempu chun intlanna siempêk a ta, ngaidam nîng a tih."
27,"And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty;","“Vantlâng laia mi tukhawmin LALPAIN thaw lo dinga a thupêkhai a ienga khawm suksuol palin, thiem- naw lo chang ta sienla,"
28,"if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.","thil a suksuol chu inhriettir a ni chun a thilinhlânah kêl, a pui dem- kailo, a thil suksuol tah suol in- thâwina dingin a hung kei ding a nih."
29,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering.","Suol inthâwina ding lu chunga chun a kut innghat a ta, pum- rawhmang thilinhlânna hmuna chun suol inthâwina chu a that ding a nih."
30,"And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar.","Thiempu chun thisen chu a kutpârin tlâwmte lâng a ta, pum- rawhmang thilinhlân mâichâm kihaia chun nâl a tih; a thisen la um po chu mâichâm bula chun a bun- thlâk ding a nih."
31,"And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.","Chun, a thâu po po chu intlanna thilinhlân thâu an lâk angin la vawng a ta; chun, thiempu chun LALPA ta dinga rim inhnikah mâichâma chun a raw ding a nih; chun, thiempu chun intlanna chu siempêk a ta, ngaidam nîng a tih."
32,"And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.","“Suol inthâwina dinga a thil- inhlâna berâmte a hung chawi chun, a la demkailo a hung chawi ding a nih."
33,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering.","Suol inthâwina lu chunga chun a kut innghat a ta, pumrawhmang thilinhlân an thatna hmuna chun suol inthâwina dingin a that ding a nih."
34,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar.","Thiempu chun suol inthâwina thisen chu a kutpârin tlâwmte lâng a ta, pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâi- châm kiahai chun nâl a ta, a thisen la um po chu mâichâm bula chun bunthlâng a tih."
35,"And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.","A thâu po po chu, berâmte thâu intlanna thilinhlân inthâwinaa mi lâk angin la vawng a ta; chun, thiem- pu chun LALPA ta dinga mei hmanga thilinhlân angin mâichâmah a raw ding a nih; chun, thiempu chun a thil suksuol ta chungchânga chun in- tlanna siempêk a ta, ngaidam nîng a tih."
