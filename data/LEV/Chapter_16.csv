1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died;","Aron naupasalhai pahniin LALPA an va hnaia an thi pha hnung chun, LALPA chun Mosie a biek a;"
2,"and Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “I unaupa Aron hril la, puonzâr sûng hmun inthiengah, bâwm chunga zângaina ṭhungpha hmaa chun a hung zing zing ding a ni nawh, thi rawi a tih; zângaina ṭhungpha chungah sûm lai ka hung inlâr ding a ni sih a."
3,"Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.","Hieng ang hin Aron chu hmun inthienga chun a fe ding a nih; suol inthâwina dingin bâwng tuoi, pum- rawhmang thilinhlân dingin berâm- chal leh."
4,"He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.","Puon zai inhmi zakaw chung chu hâk a ta, a tisa inkhumna dingin puon zai inhmi kekawr chu bun a ta, puon zai inhmi kâwngkhiin inhrêng a ta, puon zai inhmi lukhum a khum ding a nih; hieng hi silfên inthieng a nih. Insil zet zet a ta; chun, ân bel ding a nih."
5,"And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.","Israel thla mipuihaia inthawkin, suol inthâwina dingin kêlchal pahni le pumrawhmang thilinhlâna dingin berâmchal pakhat chawi a tih."
6,"And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.","“Chun, Aron chun ama puola suol inthâwina bâwngchal chu inhlân a ta, ama le a sûnghai ta dingin intlanna siem a tih."
7,"And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.","Kêl pahni chu kei a ta, intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bulah LALPA hmaah sieng a tih."
8,"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel.","Chun, Aron chun kêl pahni chungchânga chun aisân a ta, pakhat chu LALPA chanpuol nîng a ta, pa- khat chu Azazel chanpuol nîng a tih."
9,"And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering.","Aron chun LALPA chanpuola tlu kêl chu lâng a ta, suol inthâwina dingin inhlân a tih."
10,"But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness.","Azazel chanpuola tlu kêl ruok chu intlanna siemna dingin, Azazel ta dinga thlalêra insuo dingin LALPA hmaah a hringin sieng a tih."
11,"And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself.","“Aron chun ama puola suol inthâwina bâwngchal chu lâng a ta, ama le a sûnghai ta dingin intlanna siem a ta; ama puola suol inthâwina bâwngchal chu that a tih."
12,"And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:","Chun, meilâkna meilinga sip, mâichâma inthawkin LALPA hmaa chun lâng a ta, riminhnik inhniktak rawt dip dap ṭhûm hni leh puonzâr sûng tieng chun hung lûtpui a tih."
13,"and he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:","Riminhnik khû chun, thu- thlungna bâwm chunga, zângaina ṭhungpha chu bâwm dingin, LALPA hmaah meia chun riminhnik chu phul a tih, chuong naw chun thi rawi a tih."
14,"and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.","Bâwngchal thisen iengzât ama- ni chu lâng a ta, a kutpârin zângaina ṭhungpha hmatieng pang chu thêng a ta; chun, a kutpârin zângaina ṭhung- pha hmabul vêl chu, thisen chun vawi sari a the ding a nih."
15,"Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:","“Mipui puola suol inthâwina kêl chu that a ta, a thisen chu puonzâr sûng tienga chun hung lûtpui a ta; a thisen chu bâwngchal thisen a thaw ang bawk khan thâwng a ta, zângaina ṭhungpha le, zângaina ṭhungpha hmabul vêl chu thêng a tih."
16,"and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.","Chuongchun, Israel thlahai inthiengnawna lei dâm, an bawsiet- nahai lei dâm, an suolnahai lei dâmin hmun inthieng puola dingin intlanna siem a ta; chuong ang chun, an inthiengnawna laia chêng intuokna puon in puola ding khawmin siem a tih."
17,"And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.","Hmun inthienga intlanna siem dinga a lût lai chun, ama le a sûnghai le Israel mipuihai puola intlanna a siem zoa a hung suok nâwk hmakhat chun, tukhawm intuokna puon in sûnga chun an um ding a ni nawh."
18,"And he shall go out unto the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.","LALPA hmaa mâichâm tieng chun suok a ta, chu puola ding chun intlanna siem a ta; bâwngchal thisen le kêl thisen iengzât amani chu lâng a ta, mâichâm kia chun a vêlin nâl a tih."
19,"And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.","Chun, a kutpârin vawi sari thêng a ta, inthien a tih; chuongchun, Israel thlahai inthiengnawnaa in- thawk chun sukthieng a tih."
20,"And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat:",“Hmun inthieng le intuokna puon in le mâichâm puola intlanna a siem zo chun kêl hring lai chu inhlân a ta;
21,"and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness:","Aron chun kêl hring lai lu chunga chun,a kut a khing pahniin innghat a ta, a chunga chun Israel thlahai rîtlonahai po po, an baw- sietnahai po po, a suolna po po chenin insam a ta, chuonghai chu kêl lu chunga chun innghat a ta, mi pakhat a iruotsa khan thlalêr tieng ṭhuoi hmang dai a tih."
22,and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.,"Kêl chun an rîtlona po po chu chêng nawna rama chun phur a ta, kêl chu thlalêra chun ân suo ding a nih."
23,"And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:","“Chun, Aron chu intuokna puon ina chun lût a ta, hmun inthieng a lût laia puon zai inhmi silfên a hâk chu hlîp a ta, chutaka chun mâksan a ta;"
24,"and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.","hmun inthienga chun insil a ta, a silfên inbel a ta, suok a ta, ama puola pumrawhmang thilinhlân le mipui puola pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu inhlân a ta, ama le mipuihai ta dingin intlanna siem a tih."
25,And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.,"Chun, suol inthâwina thâu chu mâichâma chun rawng a tih."
26,"And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.","Chun, Azazel kuoma kêl in- suotu taphawt chun a puonhai sâwp a ta, insil a ta, chu zo chun a umna hmun tieng chun a kir nâwk ding a nih."
27,"And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.","Suol inthâwina bâwngchal le suol inthâwina kêl, an thisen intlan- na siemna dinga hmun inthienga an lûtpui chu, riebûk puotienga fepui nîng a ta; a vun dâm, a sa dâm, a êk dâm chu an raw ding a nih."
28,"And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.","A rawtu chun a puonhai sâwp a ta, insil a ta, chu zo chun riebûk tieng hung thei a tih."
29,"And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you:","“Chun, hi hi in kumkhaw dân ding nîng a tih; thla sarina, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun insukrinum in ta, sin hrim hrim in thaw ding a ni nawh, a ram mi khawmin, nangni laia um ram dang mi khawmin."
30,"for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah.","Hi ni hin, nangni sukthiengna ding cheuin in ta dingin intlanna siem a ni ding a ni sih a; chuongchun, LALPA hmaa chun in suolna po poa inthawk hung inthieng in tih."
31,"It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever.","In ta dingin châwl ṭawk ṭawkna ni a na, in insukrinum ding a nih; hi hi in kumkhaw dân ding a nih."
32,"And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father’s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:","Chun, thiempu, a pa aia thiem- pu ni dinga hriek nâl le, suktuma um chun intlanna siem a ta, puon zai inhmi silfên inthieng chu inbel a ta;"
33,and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.,"hmun inthieng puol dingin intlanna siem a ta, intuokna puon in le mâichâm puola ding chun intlanna siem bawk a ta; chun, thiempuhai le mipuihai ta dingin intlanna siem bawk a tih."
34,"And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as Jehovah commanded Moses.","An suolna po po leia kum tin vawi khat Israel thlahai ta dinga intlanna siem hi in kumkhaw dân ding a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, LALPAIN thu a pêk ang chun Mosie chun a thaw tah a."
