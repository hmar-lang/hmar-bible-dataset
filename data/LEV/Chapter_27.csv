3,"And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.","Pasal a ni chun i ruot dân ding chu, kum sâwmhnia inthawka kum sâwmruk mi chu, hmun inthieng shekel ang, tangka shekel sâwmnga hu nîng a tih."
4,"And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.","Nuhmei a ni chun i ruot dân ding chu, shekel sâwmthum nîng a tih."

8,"But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him.","Amiruokchu, i ruot nêka a lo pase chun, thiempu kuoma ṭhuoi ding nîng a tih, thiempu chun lo ruot a tih; thutiemtu thei ang tâwk tâwk thiempu chun lo ruot a tih."
9,"And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto Jehovah, all that any man giveth of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.","“Thilinhlân LALPA kuoma an inhlân ding chu ran a ni chun, tu- khawma LALPA kuoma chuong ang an pêk hrim hrim chu thil inthieng a ni ding a nih."
10,"He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.","A sukdanglam ding a ni nawh a, a ṭhain a sie, a siein a ṭha thleng ding a ni nawh; ran ran vêka a thleng lui chun, an pahniin a thlengna le chun thil inthieng an ni ding a nih."
11,"And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest;","Chun, ran inthieng naw, LALPA kuoma inhlân ngainaw mi a ni chun, ran chu thiempu hmaah a sie ding a nih;"
12,"and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.","chun, thiempu chun a ṭhat le ṭhatnaw zirin a man tâwk lo ruot a ta; nang thiempuin i ruot tâwk ang chu ni pei a tih."
13,"But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.","Amiruokchu, ân tlan nâwk nuom chun, a man ruot zât hmun ngaa ṭhea hmun khat a bel ding a nih."
14,"And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.","“Miin a in chu LALPA chanpuol dinga ân hlân chun, a ṭhat le ṭhat naw zirin thiempu chun a ruot ding a nih; thiempu ruot ang chu nîng a tih."
15,"And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.","Ân hlântu chun a in chu ân tlan nâwk ding chun, a man dinga ruot zât hmun ngaa ṭhea hmun khat a bel ding a nih; chuongchun, a ta ni nâwk a tih."
16,"And if a man shall sanctify unto Jehovah part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.","“Miin a rama lo a ṭhen LALPA puol dinga ân hlân ding chun, i ruot dân ding chu a chi tu izir peiin nîng a tih; Buṭei homer khat tûna hmun chu tangka shekel sâwmnga man nîng a tih."
17,"If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.","A lo chu jubili kuma inthawka inhlân a ni chun, i ruot ang chu ni zing a ta;"
18,"But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.","jubili kum hnunga inhlân a ni ruok chun, thiempu chun a man chu jubili tlung nâwkna ding kum izir peiin ruotpêk a ta, chun i ruot dâna inthawkin a kiem ding siem nîng a tih."
19,"And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.","Ân hlântu chun ân tlan nâwk tak tak ding chun, a man ruot zât hmun ngaa ṭhea hmun khat bel nâwk a ta, a ta ni nâwk el a tih."
20,"And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:","Lo chu ân tlan nuom naw ama- nih, mi dang kuoma zawr amanih a ni chun, intlan nâwk thei ni ta naw nih;"
21,"but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.","jubili kuma a suok nâwk pha chun, lo chu LALPA ta dinga in- thieng, a chanpuola lo siem bîk ang nîng a ta, thiempu chan ding nîng a tih."
22,"And if he sanctify unto Jehovah a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;","A rochan hluo sâwnga mi ni lo, ram a închâwk LALPA kuomah ân hlân chun,"
23,"then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto Jehovah.","jubili kum chena dingin thiem- pu chun a man ruotpêk a ta, ama chun chu ni chun ruot zât chu, LALPA ta dinga thil inthiengah a pêk ding a nih."
24,"In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.","Chun, jubili kum chun a închâwknapa, a ram neitu pângngai chun nei nâwk a tih."
25,And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.,"Chun, man sut dân po po chu hmun inthieng shekel ang huin a ni ding a nih; shekel khat chu gera sâwmhni nîng a tih."
26,"Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovah’s.","“Amiruokchu, ran laia pieng hmasa tak, a pieng hmasatak leia LALPA chanpuol dinga ruot taphawt chu, tukhawma an inhlân ding a ni nawh; bâwngchal khawm, berâm khawm ni sienla, LALPA chanpuol a nih."
27,"And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.","Ran inthieng naw a ni chun, i ruot dân angin ân tlan ding a na, hmun ngaa ṭhea hmun khat a bel ding a nih; intlan a ni naw chun, a man i ruot dân angin zawr ding a nih."
28,"Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto Jehovah of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto Jehovah.","“Amiruokchu, thil siehran, mîn a thil neihai laia mi LALPA puola a siehran taphawt chu, mihriem amanih, ran amanih, a rama lo amani chu zawr ding a ni nawh a, intlan ding a ni bawk nawh; siehran thil phawt chu LALPA ta dinga inthieng tak a nih."
29,"No one devoted, that shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.","Mi, nangni laia inthawka suk- bohmang dinga siehran taphawt chu intlan ding a ni nawh a, sukhlum ngei ding a nih."
30,"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah’s: it is holy unto Jehovah.","“Ram sûnga mi, sâwma pakhat po po, thlai amanih, thei rahai khawm, LALPA chanpuol a nih; LALPA ta dinga thil inthieng a nih."
31,"And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.","Miin a sâwma pakhat a ieng khawm intlan a nuom chun, hmun ngaa ṭhea hmun khat a bel ding a nih."
32,"And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto Jehovah.","Ran ruol le berâm ruol laia sâwma pakhat, hmawl hnuoia lût a sâwmna pei chu LALPA ta dinga inthieng nîng a tih."
33,"He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.","A siet le a ṭhat a fie ding a ni nawh a, a thleng ding a ni bawk nawh; a thleng lui chun, a thlengna leh a pahni chun thil inthieng nîng a ta, intlan nâwk thei ni naw nih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
34,"These are the commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.",Hienghai hi Sinai tlânga Israel thlahai ta dinga LALPAIN Mosie a pêk thupêkhai chu an nih.
