1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,"Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;","“Aron chu a naupasalhai leh ṭhuoi la, silfênhai, hriek nâlmi dâm, suol inthâwina ding bâwngchal dâm, berâmchal pahni, chawl ṭhanglo bei bâwm khat le chun chawi bawk la;"
3,and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.,"chun, mi po po chu intuokna puon in tuollai chun inumkhâwmtir rawh,” tiin."
4,And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.,"Mosie chun LALPAIN thu a pêk ang chun a thawh a, mi po po chu intuokna puon in tuollaia chun an um khâwm a."
5,"And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded to be done.","Mosie chun a hung khâwmhai kuoma chun, “Hi hi a nih, LALPAIN thaw dinga thu a pêk chu,” a ta."
6,"And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.","Mosie chun Aron le a naupasal- hai chu a hung ṭhuoi a, ân siltir a."
7,"And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.","Chuongchun, zakuo chung ân hâktir a, kâwng khitna chun a khit a, zakawfuol khawm chu ân hâktir a, zakaw sîng ân hâktir bawk a, zakaw sîng hrui thiemtaka khâwng chun a khit deh a."
8,And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.,"Chun, âwmbel chu a bel a; âwm- bela chun Urim le Thummim a sieh a."
9,"And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Lukhim khawm ân khimtir a; lukhim hmatieng chun rângkachak phêk suktuma um inchikna inthieng chu a bel a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
10,"And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.","Chun, Mosie chun hriek nâlmi chu a lâk a, biekbûk le a sûnga thil umhai po po chu a nâl a, a sukthieng tâwl a."
11,"And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.","Chu hriek chun mâichâm chu vawi sari a theh a; mâichâm le a hmangruo po pohai, maihûn le a ṭhuthai dâm, sukthiengna dingin hriek a nâl a."
12,"And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.","A sukthiengna dingin hriek nâlmi chu Aron lu chunga chun a bur a, a nâl tah a."
13,"And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Chun, Mosie chun Aron nau- pasalhai chu a hung ṭhuoi a, zakuo ân hâktir a, kâwng khitna chun anni chu a khit a, lukhum ân khumtir a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk angin."
14,And he brought the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.,"Chun, suol inthâwina ding bâwngchal chu a hung kei a, Aron le a naupasalhai chun, suol inthâwina ding bâwngchal lu chunga chun an kut an innghat a."
15,"And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.","Mosie chun a that a; thisen chu a lâk a, intlanna siemna dingin, mâichâm kihaia chun a kutpârin a vêlin a nâl a, mâichâm chu ân hlân thieng a, mâichâm bula chun thisen chu a bunthlâk a, a sukthieng tah a."
16,"And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it upon the altar.","A rîlbawtu po po dâm, a thin tuomtu duorda dâm, a kal pahni le a thâu dâm chu a lâk a, mâichâma chun Mosie chun a raw tah a."
17,"But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Bâwngchal chu a vun leh a sa leh, a êk leh riebûk puoah a rawh a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
18,And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.,"Pumrawhmang thilinhlân be- râmchal chu a hung inhlân a, Aron le a naupasalhai chun berâmchal lu chunga chun an kut an innghat a."
19,And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.,"Mosie chun a that a, mâichâm chu thisen chun a the huol a."
20,"And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.","Berâmchal chu a chan a, a lu le a sa tlinhai le a thâuhai chu a rawh a."
21,And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.,"A sûng le a kehai chu a sâwp a; berâmchal chu mâichâmah a pum chun a raw vawng tah a; chu chu rim inhnik dinga pumrawhmang thilin- hlân, LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlân chu a nih, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
22,"And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.","Chun, berâmchal dang, hlân- thiengna berâmchal chu a hang inhlân nâwk a; Aron le a naupasalhai chun berâmchal lu chunga chun an kut an innghat a."
23,"And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.","Mosie chun a that a, a thisen chu a lâk a, Aron nakâwr changtieng hmawra dâm, a kut changtieng kutpuia dâm, a ke changtieng kepuia dâm chun a nâl a."
24,"And he brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.","Chun,Mosie chun Aron naupa- salhai chu a ṭhuoi a, thisen chu an nakâwr changtieng hmawra dâm, an kut changtieng kutpuia dâm, an ke changtieng kepuia dâm chun a nâl a; chun, mâichâm chu thisen chun a the huol a."
25,"And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:","A thâu dâm, a mei thâu tak dâm, a rîlbawtu po po dâm chu, a thin tuomtu duorda le a kal pahni le a thâu dâm leh, a mal changtieng a lâk a."
26,"and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh:","LALPA hmaa chawl ṭhanglo bei bâwma inthawk chun chawl ṭhang- lo bei pakhat le, hrieka hmet bei- phêk pakhat leh, beiphêk inphân pakhat leh a lâk a, sathâu chunga le a mal changtieng chunga chun a sieh a."
27,"and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.",A rêng chun Aron le a naupa- salhai kuta chun a sieh a; LALPA hmaa chun thêna thilinhlân dingin an thên a.
28,"And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.","Chun, Mosie chun an kuta in- thawk chun a lâk a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân chungah mâichâma chun a rawh a; chu chu riminhnik dinga suktumna thilinhlân, LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlân a nih."
29,"And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: it was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Chun, Mosie chun a ir chu a lâk a, LALPA hmaa thêna thilinhlân dingin a thên a, chu chu suktum- na berâmchala Mosie chanpuol a nih, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
30,"And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.","Mosie chun hriek nâlmia in- thawk le, mâichâma thisena mi chu a lâk a, chu chun Aron le a silfênhai a theh a, a naupasalhai le an silfênhai khawm; Aron le a silfênhai chu a hlân thieng a, a naupasalhai le an silfên- hai khawm."
31,"And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.","Mosie chun Aron le a naupa- salhai kuoma chun, “Intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bulah sa kha suong unla, ‘Aron le a naupasalhai chun fa rawhai se,’ tiha thu pêka ka um angin inhlân thiengna leikhâwra bei le chun chutaka chun fa ro."
32,And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.,"Chun, sa le bei a la chuong chu meiah in raw ding a nih."
33,"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.","In inhlân thieng nihai a kim hmakhat chun, ni sari sûng chu intuokna puon in kawtkhâra inthawk chun suok naw tawp ro, hi inhlân thiengna hin ni sari sûng a aw ding a ni sih a."
34,"As hath been done this day, so Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.",Tuta thaw ang hin intlanna siempêk ding cheuin LALPA chun thaw ding thu a pêk a nih.
35,"And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.","Intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bula chun ni sari, sûn le zân um zing in ta, in thi nawna dingin LALPA thupêk chu in zâwm ding a nih, chuong anga thu pêk chu ka nih,” a ta."
36,And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Jehovah commanded by Moses.,"Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie hmanga thaw dinga thu a pêkhai po po chu Aron le a naupasalhai chun an thawh a."
