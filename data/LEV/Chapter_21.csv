1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Aron naupasal thiempuhai chu hril la an kuomah, ‘Mi tukhawm mithi leiin an chipuihai lai an insukpawrche ding a ni nawh."
2,"except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,","A sûng bul, a nu, a pa, a naupa- sal, a naunu, a unaupa dâm le,"
3,"and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband; for her may he defile himself.","a farnu, pasal la neilo nunghâk inthieng lai thinaa ruok chun insuk- pawrche thei a tih."
4,"He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.","A chipuihai laia lusa a ni leiin ân sukpawrche ding a ni nawh a, ân sukhmingse ding a ni nawh."
5,"They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.","An lu an vaw kawl ding a ni nawh a, khâkhmul sîr tuok an tan ding a ni bawk nawh a, an taksa chu an ât pawp ding a ni bawk nawh."
6,"They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.","An Pathien ta dingin mi inthieng an ni ding a na, an Pathien hming an suksiet ding a ni nawh; LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlânhai le fâk ding dâm an inhlân hlak leiin; chuleiin, an inthieng ding a nih."
7,"They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.","Nawchizawr amanih, hming se tah amanih, a pasal imâk hnung amanih an nei ding a ni nawh; thiempu chu a Pathien ta dingin mi inthieng a ni sih a."
8,"Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee; for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy.","Ama chu în hlân thieng ding a na, i Pathien ta dinga fâkmi thilinhlân chu ân hlân hlak sih a. I ta dinga mi inthieng a ni ding a nih. Kei LALPA a sukthiengtu cheu hi kân thieng sih a."
9,"And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.","Thiempu naunuhmei tukhawm nawchizawra ân sukpawrche chun, a pa a sukpawrche a na, ama chu raw ding a nih."
10,"And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes;","“A unauhai laia thiempu inlal tak, a lu hriek nâlmia nâl tah, silfên bel dinga suktuma um ta chun, a sam chu a thlâiin a put ding a ni nawh a, a puonhai a keithlêr ding a ni nawh a,"
11,"neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;","mithi ruong umnaa chun a lût ding a ni nawh a, a pa amanih, a nu amani leiin ân sukpawrche ding a ni nawh;"
12,"neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah.","hmun inthienga inthawk chun a suok ding a ni bawk nawh a, a Pathien hmun inthieng chu a suk- pawrche ding a ni bawk nawh; a Pathien hriek nâlmia suktumin a um ta sih a: Kei hi LALPA chu ka nih."
13,And he shall take a wife in her virginity.,Nuhmei ding chun nunghâk hnakhat a nei ding a nih.
14,"A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife.","Hmeithai amanih, mâk hnung amanih, nuhmei hming setah ama- nih, nawchizawr amani chu a nei ding a ni nawh a, ama chipui ngei nu- nghâk inthieng nuhmeiah a nei ding a nih;"
15,And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth him.,"chuongchun, a chipui lai a thlahai chu a sukpawrche naw ding a nih; kei hi LALPA ama sukthiengtu chu ka ni sih a,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
16,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
17,"Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.","“Aron kuomah hril la, ‘I thlahai laia an suonlepârhai lai chena demkai taphawt chun, a Pathien fâk ding thilinhlân inhlân dingin hung hnai naw raw se."
18,"For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous,","Tukhawm demkâi taphawt chun an hung hnai ding a ni dêr nawh; mitdel, kebai, hmai hmêlhem, kut ke sei taluo dâm,"
19,"or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,","kea hliemna nei, kut hliem dâm,"
20,"or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;","zângkûn, mi tawnginsam, mit- hmu fie naw, pang inthak nei, pang inhlip, tilmu kawi dâm;"
21,"no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.","thiempu Aron thlahai laia mi tukhawm demkaina nei chu, LALPA ta dinga mei hmanga thilinhlân inhlân dingin a hung hnai ding a ni nawh; demkaina nei a na, a Pathien fâk ding thilinhlân chu inhlân dingin a hung hnai ding a ni nawh."
22,"He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy:","A Pathien fâkmi thilinhlâna mi, ân thieng tak le thil inthienghaia mi chu fa thei a ta;"
23,"only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.","amiruokchu, demkaina nei a ni leiin, puonzâr bula manih, mâichâm hnaia mani chu hung thei naw ni, ka hmun inthienghai sukpawrche rawi a tih; kei LALPA anni sukthiengtu chu ka ni sih a,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
24,"So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Aron le a naupasalhai le Israel thlahai po po kuoma chun a hril tah a."
