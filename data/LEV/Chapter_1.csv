9,"but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water. And the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.","a sûnghai le a kehai ruok chu tuiin sâwp an ta; thiempu chun LALPA ta dinga rim inhniktak, mei hmanga thilinhlân pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin a pum chun mâi- châma chun a raw ding a nih."
10,"And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish.","“A thilinhlân chu pumrawhmang thilinhlân dinga ran ruol laia mi, berâm amanih, kêl amanih a ni chun, a chal demkailo ân hlân ding a nih."

13,"but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water. And the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.","a sûnghai le a kehai ruok chu tuiin sâwp a ta, a pumin thiempu chun inhlân a ta, mâichâma chun a raw ding a nih; LALPA ta dinga riminhniktak, mei hmanga pumraw- hmang thilinhlân a nih."
14,"And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.","“LALPA ta dinga a thilinhlân chu vate tieng pumrawhmang thilin- hlân a ni chun, a thilinhlâna chun, vaṭhuhai amanih, pârvate amanih ân hlân ding a nih."
15,"And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar;","Thiempu chun mâichâma chun hung chawi a ta, a lu chu her bawng a ta, mâichâma chun rawng a ta, a thisen chu mâichâm panga chun infar kangtir a tih."

17,"and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder. And the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.","A thla le a thla inkârah thlêr a ta, a puma thlêr suok ruok chu ni loin; chun, thiempu chun mâichâmah, mei chunga thinga chun a raw ding a nih; chu chu LALPA ta dinga riminhniktak, mei hmanga thilinhlân, pumrawhmang thilinhlân a nih."
