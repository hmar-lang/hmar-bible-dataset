3,"Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.","Sa laia a tin inkâk a, a irsuok sawi chi taphawt chu fa thei in tih."
4,"Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.","Amiruokchu, irsuok sawi chi le tin inkâk laia miah hienghai hi chu in fâk ding a ni nawh: sanghâwngsei, irsuok chu a sawi a, a ke tin ân kâk naw leiin in ta dingin a thieng naw a nih."
5,"And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.","Râwl mazupui, irsuok a sawi deha chu, a tin ân kâk naw leiin in ta dingin thieng naw a nih."

8,"Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you.","An sa in fâk ding a ni nawh a, an ruong khawm in tâwk ding a ni nawh, in ta dingin an inthieng naw a nih."
9,"These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat.","“Tuia chêng po po lai hienghai hi fa thei in tih: Tuisuorieta manih, vadunga manih, tuia chêng pângpar le phuhlip nei taphawt chu fa thei in tih."
10,"And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,","Tuia chêng hai po po le, tuia thilhring um po po laiah, tuisuorieta mi amanih, vadunga mi amanih pângpar le phuhlip nei naw taphawt chu in ta dingin thil tirdakum an nih."
11,"and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.","In ta dingin thil tirdakum nîng an ta, an sa in fâk ding a ni nawh a, an ruonghai khawm chu thil tirdak- umah in nei ding a nih."

14,"and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,","mute dâm, muvânlai chi hrim hrim dâm;"
15,"every raven after its kind,","vaâk tieng chi hrim hrim dâm,"
16,"and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind,","ostrik dâm, vabak dâm, tuipui pelêu dâm, mu chi hrim hrim dâm,"
17,"and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,","simbu dâm, kaikuongrâl dâm, chingpirinu dâm,"
18,"and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,","tui vatâwk dâm, tuivalawng dâm, mulukawl dâm,"
19,"and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.","tuivaârngo dâm, awinu chi hrim hrim, va khawhri dâm le bâk dâm khawm."
20,All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you.,“Thla nei ke palia lâwn chi hrim hrim chu in ta dingin thil tirdakum nîng an ta.
21,"Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth;","Amiruokchu, thla nei, ke palia lâwn chi khawm hnuoi chunga inchâwmna dinga an kepâr chung tienga êlpui nei po po fa thei in ta;"
22,"even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.","chuonghai laia chun, khâuṭhik- ṭhi chi hrim hrim dâm, ṭhângkhâu chi hrim hrim dâm, khuongbai chi hrim hrim dâm fa thei in tih."
23,"But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you.","Amiruokchu, thla nei, ke pali nei, a lâwna lâwn chi po po chu in ta dingin thil tirdakum ni vawng an tih."
24,And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;,"“Chun, hieng lei hin inthieng naw hung kai thei in tih; mi tukhawm saruong tâwk taphawt chu zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng an ta;"
25,"and whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.","tukhawm hieng ruonghai latu- hai chun an puonhai an sâwp ding a na, zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng an tih."
26,"Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.","Ran a tin inkâk a, inkâk suok lo, irsuok khawm sawi lo chi taphawt chu in ta dingin thil tirdakum nîng an tih."
27,"And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even.","Chun, sapheimanli chi po poah kebawra lâwn taphawt chu in ta dingin thil tirdakum an na: an ruong tâwk taphawt chu zântieng chenin inthiengnaw nîng an tih."
28,"And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.","An ruong latuhai taphawt chun an puonhai an sâwp ding a na, zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng an tih; in ta dingin thil tirdakum a nih."
29,"And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,","“Chun, hnuoia invâka invâk chi laia in ta dinga thil tirdakum chu hieng hi nîng an tih: bui dâm, mazu dâm, tangkâwng chi hrim hrim dâm,"
30,"and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.","sawkkhe dâm, khawmuol awle dâm, chawlru dâm, tangmâm dâm, laikîng dâm."
31,"These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.",Hieng hi invâka invâk chi po po laia in ta dinga thil tirdakumhai chu an nih.
32,"And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.","An thia thil iengkhawm an del chu inthieng naw ni pei an tih; thil hmang lai phawt, thing hmangruo dâm, puon dâm, savun dâm, saiip dâm khawm ni sienla, tuia inchie ding a na, zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng a tih; chu zo chun inthieng a tih."
33,"And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.","Pil bêl iengkhawm sûngah a tla lût chun, a sûnga um po po chu in- thieng naw a nih a, in sukkawi ding a nih."
34,"All food therein which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.","Chu bêla fâk mi po po khawm, chutaka tuiin a khieng ta hrim hrim chu thil inthieng naw nîng a tih; chuong ang bêl hrim hrima dâwnmi dâwn thei chi po po inthieng naw an nih."
35,"And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.","Thil iengkhawm an ruong a ieng lai khawma a del taphawt chu thil tirdakum ni pei a ta, bei urna thuk amanih, a zêuna bêl amani khawm ni sienla vuok kawi pei ding a nih; a pawrche tah a, in ta dingin thil inthieng naw a ni ding a nih."
36,Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.,"Amiruokchu, tuikhur amanih, tuibêl amanih, tui intling khâwm amani chu pawrche naw nih a, an ruongin a itâwk taphawt ruok chu zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng a tih."
37,"And if aught of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.","Chun, thlai chi chîngmi hrim hrim chu an ruong chun a ieng lai khawm lo del ta sienla a pawrche nawh a."
38,"But if water be put upon the seed, and aught of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.","Amiruokchu, thlai chi tuia inchie hnung an ruong a ieng lai khawmin del sienla, in ta dingin thil inthien gnaw a nih."
39,"And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.","“Ran in fâk thei chi hrim hrim khawm lo thi ta sienla, a ruong tâwktu taphawt chu zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng a tih."
40,"And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.","A sa fa taphawt chun an puon sâwp an ta, zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng an tih; a ruong latu khawm chun a puonhai a sâwp ding a na, zântieng chenin inthieng naw nîng a tih."
41,And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.,"“Thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâk chi po po chu thil tirdakum an na, in fâk ding a ni nawh."
42,"Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.","Phînga intawl chi le ke palia invâk chi amanih, ke tamtak nei chi amanih, hnuoia bawkinvâk chi hrim hrim chu in fâk ding a ni nawh, thil tirdakum an ni sih a."
43,"Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.",Bawkinvâk chi hrim hrimin in insukpawrche ding a ni nawh; thieng naw in ni nawna dingin anni chun in insukpawrche ding a ni bawk nawh.
44,"For I am Jehovah your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.","Kei hi LALPA in Pathien ka ni sih a; chuleiin, insukthieng unla, inthiengin um ro; kei kân thieng sih a; hnuoia chêng, bawkinvâk chi a ieng ieng khawma insukpawrche naw ro."
45,"For I am Jehovah that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.","In Pathien ni dinga Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoitu cheu LALPA chu ka ni sih a; kei kân thieng sih a, chuleiin, nangni khawm in inthieng ding a nih."
46,"This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;",Hi hi sa le vate le thilhring tuia chêng mi tinrêng le hnuoia bawkin- vâk chi tinrênghai chungchânga dân ding chu a nih;
47,"to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.","a thieng le thieng naw thlierna ding le, thilhring fâk thei mi le fâk theilo mi thlierna dingin,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
