1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest:,“Hi hi inphâr a inthien nia a thaw dân ding chu ning a tih: Thiem- pu kuoma ṭhuoi ding a na;
3,"and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,","thiempu chu riebûk puotieng fe suok a ta, en a tih. Inphâr chu a phârna chu a dam ta chun,"
4,"then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:","thiempu chun, a inthienna ding chun, vate hring inthieng pahni le sidar thing le patzai sen le husop hung chawipêk ding thu pêng a ta;"
5,and the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.,thiempu chun vate pakhat pil bêlah vadung tui luong chunga that dingin thu pêng a tih.
6,"As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:","Vate hring ruok chu, sidar thing dâm, patzai sen dâm, husop dâm le chun chawi a ta, vadung tui chunga vate thata um thisena chun phûm vawng a ta;"
7,"and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field.","inphârnaa inthawka inthien ding chu, thisen chun vawi sari thêng a ta, ân thieng tah tiin phuong a ta; chun, vate hring chu ramah insuong a tih."
8,"And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.","Chun, a inthien ding chun a puonhai sâwp a ta, invaw fai vawng a ta, an sil ding a nih; chuongchun, inthieng hung nîng a ta; chu zo chun riebûkah fêng a ta, amiruokchu, a puon in puoa chun ni sari a um ding a nih."
9,"And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.","Chun, a ni sari ni chun a lu sam po po le a khâkhmul le, a mitkho hmul dâm vaw kawl a ta, a hmul po po chu vaw fai vawng a ta; chun, a puonhai sâwp a ta, ân sil ding a nih; chuongchun, inthieng hung ni tâng a tih."
10,"And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.","“Chun, ni riet ni chun berâmte a chal pahni demkailo le berâmte a la pakhat, demkailo kum khat mi le, fâkmi thilinhlân dinga beiphit indi- tak epha hmun sâwma ṭheha hmun thum hrieka hmet le hriek limlai khat a chawi ding a nih."
11,"And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.","Chun, ân thientu thiempu chun a inthien ding le chuong thilhai chu intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bulah LALPA hmaah sieng a tih."
12,"And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah:","Thiempu chun berâmte pakhat chu hriek limlai khat le chun lâng a ta, bawsiet inthâwina dingin inhlân a tih; LALPA hmaa thêna thilinhlân dingin a thên ding a nih."
13,"and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy.","Chun, suol inthâwina le pum- rawhmang thilinhlân an thatna hlak hmun, hmun inthienga chun berâmte chal chu a that ding a nih; suol inthâwina ang bawkin bawsiet in- thâwina khawm chu thiempu chan- puol a nih a; thil inthiengtak a nih."
14,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.","Thiempu chun bawsiet inthâwi- na thisen chu lâng a ta, inthien ding nakâwr changtieng hmawra dâm, a kut changtieng kutpuia dâm, a ke changtieng kepuia dâm thiempu chun nâl a tih."
15,"And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;","Chun, hriek limlai khat chu thiempu chun lâng a ta, ama vawitieng kutphaa chun sung a ta;"
16,"and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah.","a kut vawitienga hrieka chun a changtieng kutpâr phûm a ta, hriek chu LALPA hmaah a kutpârin vawi sari thêng a tih."
17,"And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering:","Chun, a kuta hriek la um ṭhenkhat chun inthien ding chu a nakâwr changtieng hmawr dâm, a kut changtieng kutpui dâm, a ke changtieng kepui dâma bawsiet in- thâwina thisen chunga chun nâl a tih."
18,and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah.,"Chun, thiempu chun a kuta hriek la um po chun, inthien ding lu chu nâl a tih. Chun, thiempu chun LALPA hmaah intlanna a siempêk ding a nih."
19,"And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering;","Chun, thiempu chun suol in- thâwina chu inhlân a ta, ân thieng- nawna leia inthien ding chu intlanna siempêk a tih. Chu zo chun, pum- rawhmang thilinhlân chu that a ta;"
20,"and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.","chun, thiempu chun pumraw- hmang thilinhlân le fâkmi thilinhlân chu mâichâma chun inhlân a ta, thiempu chun intlanna siempêk a tih; chuongchun, inthieng hung ni tâng a tih."
21,"And if he be poor, and cannot get so much, then he shall take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil;","“Chun, mi pasie a nih a, chuong ang chu a tlin naw chun, berâmte a chal pakhat bawsiet inthâwina ding, intlanna siempêkna ding thên ding le, fâkmi thilinhlân dingin beiphit inditak epha hmun sâwma ṭhea hmun khat, hrieka chawkpawl, hriek limlai khat leh chawi a ta;"
22,"and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.","chun, vaṭhu tuok khat amanih, pârvate tuok khat amanih, a nei thei lem lem chu pakhat chu suol in- thâwina ding, a dang chu pum- rawhmang thilinhlân dingin."
23,"And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah:",Ni riet ni chun a inthienna dingin thiempu kuomah intuokna puon in kawtkhâr bulah LALPA hmaah a hung chawi ding a nih.
24,"and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.","Chuongchun, thiempu chun bawsiet inthâwina berâmte le hriek limlai khat chu lâng a ta, thêna thilinhlân dingin LALPA hmaah thiempu chun thên a tih."
25,"And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.","Bawsiet inthâwina berâmte chu that a ta; thiempu chun bawsiet inthâwina thisen chu lâng a ta, inthien ding nakâwr changtieng hmawra dâm, a kut changtieng kut- puia dâm, a ke changtieng kepuia dâm nâl a tih."
26,And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;,Thiempu chun hriek iemani tâwk ama kutpha vawitienga chun bun a ta;
27,and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah:,a kut vawitienga hriek ṭhen- khat chu a kut changtiengin LALPA hmaah vawi sari thêng a tih.
28,"and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering:","Chun, thiempu chun a kuta hriek chun inthien ding nakâwr changtieng hmawra dâm, a kut changtieng kutpuia dâm, a ke changtieng kepuia dâma bawsiet inthâwina thisen chung taka chun nâl a ta;"
29,"and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah.","chun, thiempu kuta hriek la um po chun LALPA hmaa intlanna siempêk dingin, inthien ding lu a nâl ding a nih."
30,"And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,","Chun, vaṭhu amanih, pârvate amanih, a nei thei lem lem pakhat chu inhlân a ta; a nei thei lem lem taphawt,"
31,"even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah.","suol inthâwina dingin pakhat, pumrawhmang thilinhlâna dingin pakhat, fâkmi thilinhlân leh; chun, thiempu chun inthien ding chu LALPA hmaa chun intlanna siempêk a tih."
32,"This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.","Hi hi inphârna hri invawi, inthienna dân ang tlin nawhai ta dinga dân a nih,” tiin."
33,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie le Aron a biek a,"
34,"When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;","“Hluo dinga ka pêk cheu Kanaan ram in hluo pha, in hluo ding in khawlaia khawm inphârna hri ka sie chun,"
35,"then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house.","chu in neitu chun, ‘Hi ina hin hri ṭhenkhat um âwmin ka hriet,’ tiin thiempu a hung hril ding a nih."
36,"And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goeth in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:","Chun, thiempu chu hri en dinga a lût hma chun, in sûnga thil umhai po po chu inthieng loa a um nawna dingin, in chu sukruok dingin thiempu chun thu pêng a ta; chu zo chun thiempu chu in en ding chun lût a tih."
37,"and he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall;","Chun, hri chu en a ta; hri chun a hring tieng amanih, a sen tieng deu amaniha banga chun a lo kai a, bang chu a phaia ân lang ta chun,"
38,"then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.","thiempu chu ina inthawk chun kawtkhârah suok a ta, in chu ni sari khâr a tih."
39,"And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;","Chun, ni sari ni chun, thiempu chun va en nâwk a ta; hri chu banga chun a lo indar lien chun,"
40,"then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:","hri umna lung chu lâk suok a, khawhnâwmah hmun pawrchea pei dingin thiempu chun thu pêng a ta;"
41,"and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place:","chun, in sûng tieng chu inziet vêltir a ta, chun lung chârna an ziet khawk chu khawhnâwmah hmun pawrchea bawk chun bun thlâng a ta;"
42,"and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.","chun, lung dang lâng an ta, chuong lunghai hmuna chun sieng an tih; chun, lung chârna dang lâng a ta, in chu châr a tih."
43,"And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;","Chun, lung a lâk suok a, in chu a phâwk a, a ziet hnunga hri chu ina a hung suok nâwk chun,"
44,"then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.","thiempu chu va fêng a ta, en nâwk a tih; hri chu ina chun a lo indar lien chun, chu ina inphârna hri chu a det chi a na, ân thieng naw a nih."
45,"And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.","In chu ṭhiek a ta, a lunghai, a thinghai le a chârnahai po po khawm; chun, khawhnâwmah hmun pawr- cheah thak hmang a tih."
46,Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.,Tukhawm chu in chu khâr a ni sûng hrim hrima lût chu zântieng chenin inthieng naw ni bawk a tih.
47,And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.,Tukhawm chu ina zâl taphawt chun a puonhai sâwp a tih. Tukhawm chu ina bu fa taphawt khawmin a puonhai a sâwp ding a nih.
48,"And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.","“Chun, thiempu chu a lût a, a hang en vêl a, in chu phâwk ṭhat a ni hnunga hri chu a lo indar lien naw chun, in chu ân thieng a nih ti thiempu chun a phuong ding a nih, hri chu ân kieng ta leiin."
49,"And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:",In inthienna ding chun vate pahni le sidar thing le patzai sen le husop a chawi ding a nih.
50,and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:,"Vate chu pil bêlah vadung tui chungah that a ta,"
51,"and he shall take the cedar-wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:","sidar thing le husop le patzai sen chu vate hring le chun lâng a ta, vate thata um tah thisena le vadung tuia chun phûm a ta; in chu vawi sari thêng a tih."
52,"and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar-wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:","Chuong ang chun, vate thisen dâm, vadung tui dâm, vate hring dâm, sidar thing dâm, patzai sen dâm chun in chu inthien a tih."
53,but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open field: so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.,"Vate hring ruok kha chu khuoa inthawkin ramhnuoiah invuong suoktir a tih; chuongchun, in inthien- na chu siem a ta, in chu hung inthieng tâng a tih."
54,"This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,",“Hi hi inphârna chi tinrêng le inbuotna hri ta dinga dân chu a nih;
55,"and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,","puona inphârna hri um le ina mi dâm,"
56,"and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;","ân vûng dâm, a puor suok dâm, a hmun hmuna inlang dâm,"
57,"to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.","ân thieng le ân thieng naw inhrietna dingin. Hi hi inphârna chungchânga dân chu a nih,” tiin."
