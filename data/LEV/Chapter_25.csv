1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,","Sinai tlângah LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Jehovah.","“Israel thlahai hril la, an kuom- ah, ‘Ram ka pêk cheu in va tlung pha chun, ram chu LALPA hmingin a châwl ding a nih."
3,"Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof;","I loa chun kum ruk sûng chu thil chîng i ta, grêp huon chu kum ruk sûng chu sât der i ta, a ra suokhai sîk i ta;"
4,"but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.","a kum sari kum ruok chu ram châwl dêrna, LALPA hminga châwlna nîng a tih; i loa chun thlai i chîng ding a ni nawh a, i grêp huon khawm chu i sât der ding a ni bawk nawh."
5,"That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.","I lohmaa amaa mâwng chu i sîk ding a ni nawh a, i enkawl naw grêp chu i lo ding a ni bawk nawh; ram châwl dêrna kum a ni ding a nih."
6,"And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee.","Ram châwl kum chun in fâkfâwm ding insuopêk a ti cheu a; i ta ding dâm, i siehlawpa le i siehlawnu ta ding dâm, i inhlawfa ta ding dâm, i kuoma khawsa ram dang mi ta ding dâm,"
7,"And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.","i bâwng ruol ta ding dâm, i rama ranhai ta ding dâm, chutaka a hung ra suok po po chu fâkfâwm ding nîng a tih."
8,"And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years.","“Chun, châwl kum kum sari tiem i ta, kum sari hmun sari nîng a ta, châwl kum kum sari sûng chu kum sâwmli pakuo nîng a ta."
9,Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.,Chu hnung thla sarina ni sâwm ni chun tawtawrâwt inringtak chu inmût vêltir i ta; intlanna nia chun in ram po poah tawtawrâwt in inmût vêltir ding a nih.
10,"And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.","Chu kum sâwmngana chu inser thieng i ta, ram sûnga um po pohai kuomah zalênna thu in phuong ding a nih; in ta dingin jubili nîng a ta; mi tinin mâni ta ngai nei nâwk in ta; mi tin chu mâni insûng khur sengah in um nâwk ding a nih."
11,"A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of the undressed vines.","Chu kum sâwmngana chu in ta dingin jubili nîng a ta; iengkhawm chîng naw ti niu a, amaa mâwng khawm sîk bawk naw ti niu a, grêp enkawl naw ra chu in lo ding a ni bawk nawh."
12,For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.,Jubili a ni sih a; in ta dingin kum inthieng a ni ding a nih; inloa thil ra suok chu in fâk ding a nih.
13,In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.,Hi jubili kum hin mi tinin mâni ta ngei in chang nâwk seng ding a nih.
14,"And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor’s hand, ye shall not wrong one another.","I tuolbâwm kuomah ieng ama- nih i zawr a, i tuolbâwma inthawkin ieng amanih în châwk khawma i hlêm ding a ni nawh;"
15,"According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee.","jubili hnunga kum zât ang peiin i tuolbâwm thil chu inchâwng i ta, bu le bâl tam kum izirin i kuomah a zawr ding a nih."
16,"According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee.","A kum tam dân zir peiin a man chu sukpung i ta, a kum tlâwm dân zir peiin a man chu i suktlâwm ding a nih; lohma suok pung kum zirin i kuoma chun zawr a ni ding a nih."
17,And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am Jehovah your God.,"In inhlêm ding a ni nawh a, in Pathien chu in ṭi ding a nih: kei hi LALPA in Pathien chu ka ni sih a."
18,"Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.","“Chuleiin, ka thuruothai chu in zâwmin, ka rorêlhai chu in pawmin in ṭi ding a nih; chuongchun, chu rama chun thlamuongtakin in khawsa ding a nih."
19,"And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.","Ram chun ra insuong a ta, tlaitakin chên in ta, thlamuongtakin in va khawsa ding a nih."
20,"And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;","‘Iengkhawm kan chîng nawh a, thlai ra iengkhawm kan sîk naw bawk ding chun, kum sarina kum chun ieng am fâng kan ta?’ in ti a ni thei a;"
21,"then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.","a kum ruk kum chun ka malsâwmna in chungah intlungtir ka ta, kum thum sûnga ding chun ra insuong a tih."
22,"And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store.","Chun, a kum riet kum chun chîng in ta, thil ra suok in kawl, a hluihai chu fâng in ta, kum kuo kum chun, a hung thar nâwk chen chun, a hlui in kawlhai chu in fâk ding a nih."
23,And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.,"“Kumkhuoa dingin ram chu zawr sawng ding a ni nawh, ram chu ka ta a ni sih a; ka kuoma khawsa mikhuol le khuolchâm el in ni sih a."
24,And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.,"Chun, ram in hluo po poa chun, ram intlan in phal ding a nih."
25,"If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold.","“I unau chu hung pasein, a ram ṭhenkhat lo zawr sienla, a laibung bul takin a unauin a lo zawr chu a hung intlan ding a nih."
26,"And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;","Chun, mîn intlanpêktu ding a nei nawh a, ama a hung khawsa thei a, intlanna ding khawp a hung nei chun,"
27,"then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession.","a lo zawr china kum chu sut sienla, a zawrnapa kuoma chun a intêl chuong chu pe kîr raw se; chuongchun, a ram chu ama ma chun hluo nâwk a tih."
28,"But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.","A ta dinga ân tlan kîr nâwk thei naw chun, a zawr ta chu jubili kum chenin ân chawtu kuta chun um raw se; chun, jubili kum chun suok nâwk a ta, ama chun a ram chu hluo nâwk a tih."
29,"And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.","“Kul nei khuoah miin in a zawr chun, a zawra inthawka kum khat pumhlûm sûng intlan nâwk thei a tih; kum khat pumhlûm sûng chun intlan nâwk theina nei a tih."
30,"And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.","Kum khat sûnga ân tlan nâwk thei naw chun, kul nei sûnga khuoa in chu, ân chawtu nei sawng dinga siem nîng a ta, a thlahai chena an ta ni tâng a ta, jubilia khawm suok chuong naw nih."
31,"But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.","Kul nei naw khuoa inhai ruok chu, thingtlâng ram anga ngai nîng a ta, intlan nîng a ta, jubili chun insuo nîng an tih."
32,"Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.","Amiruokchu, Levi mihai khuo, an chanpuola khuoa inhai chu Levi mihai chun ieng lai khawma intlan thei an tih."
33,"And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.","Chun, Levi mihai laia miin ân tlan naw chun zawr tah in le, a chanpuol khuo chu jubilia chun suok a tih; Levi mihai khuoa inhai chu Israel thlahai laia an chanpuol a ni sih a."
34,But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.,"An khaw kâwl vêla lohai ruok chu zawr thei ni naw nih, an kum- khaw chanpuol a ni sih a."
35,"And if thy brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: as a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.","“Chun, i unau a hung paseh a, a hung bêl che chun i lo sawmdâwl ding a nih; mikhuol le khuolchâm i kuoma khawsa angin i umpui ding a nih."
36,"Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.","A kuomah tangka amanih, thil amanih, a pung la naw rawh; Pathien ṭi lem rawh; i unau chu i kuoma a khawsak theina dingin."
37,"Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase.","A pung hnawtin i sum în pûktir ding a ni nawh a, a pung hnawtin i fâk ding lai hai khawm inpûktir naw rawh."
38,"I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.","Kei hi LALPA in Pathien, Kanaan ram pe ding cheu le, in Pathien ni dinga Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu cheu ka nih."
39,"And if thy brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant.","“I unau a hung paseh a, i kuoma a hung tlulût chun, suok angin i sawr ding a ni nawh a;"
40,"As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee:",inhlawfa ang le i kuoma khawsa ve angin i umpui ding a nih; Jubili kum chen i rawng bâwl a ta;
41,"then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.","chu zo chun i kuoma inthawkin suok a ta, ama le a nauhai leh; chun, anni sûngkuo pângngaia chun lût nâwk an ta, an pi le puhai in le lo an hluo nâwk ding a nih."
42,"For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.","Aigupta rama inthawka ka ṭhuoi suok, ka siehlawhai an ni sih a, suok zawra zawr ding an ni nawh."
43,"Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.","Rilotakin a chungah i um ding a ni nawh a, i Pathien chu i ṭi ding a ni lem."
44,"And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.","Suoknu le suokpaa i nei ding chu: in vêla hnam laia mi, suoknu le suokpa ding chun în châwk ding a nih."
45,"Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession.","Chun, nangni laia khawsa ram dang mihai le, in rama pieng an sûng- hai laia mi khawm inchaw thei bawk in tih; anni chu in thilnei hung nîng an tih."
46,"And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.","Chun, nangni hnunga in nauhai ro hluo sâwng thilah siem in ta; chuonghai chu in kumkhaw suok dingin siem thei in ta; amiruokchu, in unau Israel thlahai laia ruok chun rilotakin in um ding a ni nawh."
47,"And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family;","“Ram dang mi amanih, i kuoma khawsa tu amanih a hung hausa a, a kuoma i unaupa a hung paseh a, i kuoma ram dang mi kuoma manih, i kuoma khawsa kuoma manih, ram dang mi thlahai kuoma manih a tlu lût chun,"
48,after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;,"a tlûk lût hnung khawma intlan thei nîng a ta, a unauhai laia miin intlan thei a tih."
49,"or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself.","A pamiin amanih, a pami naupân amanih intlan thei a tih; a chihai laia a laibung hnaiin amani khawm intlan thei a tih; chun, ama khawm a hung hausa chun ama le ama chu intlan thei a tih."
50,And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.,"A tlûk lûtnapa leh a tlûk lûta inthawka jubili kum nâwk ding sût hmunkhat hai sienla, a tlûk lût man chu a kum zir nîng a ta; chun, in- hlawfa a ruoi sûtpêk ang peia sûtpêk nîng a tih."
51,"If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.","Kum tamtak a la bâk chun, a la bâk zât hu chu sûtin, ama inchâwkna mana inthawkin let kîr nîng a ta."
52,"And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.","Jubili kum tlungna ding kum tlâwmte chau um a ni chun, sût hmunkhat hai sienla, a sinthaw ding la bâk kum izirin, ân tlanna dingin tangka chu a pêk kîr ding a nih."
53,As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.,Kum khat bi peia ruoi inhlawfa angin a bêl ding a na; i mithmua chun rilotakin a thaw ding a ni nawh.
54,"And if he be not redeemed by these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.","Chuong ang zâwnga intlan a ni naw khawma, jubili kum chun suok a ta, ama le a nauhai leh."
55,For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.,"Israel thlahai chu keima sie- hlawhai an ni sih a, Aigupta rama inthawka ka ṭhuoi suok, ka sie- hlawhai an nih: Kei hi LALPA in Pathien chu ka nih."
