1,"And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them.","Aron naupasalhai Nadab le Abihu chun an mei lâkna chu an lâk ve veh a, chutaka chun meiling chu an sieh a, riminhnik chu an phul a, LALPA hmaah thu a pêk naw dântakin mei inthiengnaw an in- hlân a."
2,"And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.","Chuongchun, LALPA hmaa in- thawkin mei a hung suok a, anni chu a kâng hlum a, LALPA hmaa chun an thi tah a."
3,"Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Aron kuomah, “Hi hi a nih LALPAIN, ‘A mi hnaituhaia chun inthiengin inlang ka ta, mipui po po hmaa chun chawi- mawiin um ka tih,’ tiha a hril kha,” a tih a. Aron chu a to zing a."
4,"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.","Chun, Mosie chun Aron pami Uzziel naupa Misael le Elzaphan chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Hung hnai unla, in unauhai hi hmun inthienga inthawk hin riebûk puoah zâwn dawk ro,” a ta."
5,"So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.","Chuongchun, an hung hnai a, zakuo hâk pumin riebûk puoa chun, Mosie hril angin an zâwn dawk a."
6,"And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled.","Mosie chun Aron kuoma le a naupasalhai Eleazar le Ithamar kuoma chun, “A sûnnain in sam inthla naw unla, in puonhai keithlêr bawk naw ro, chuong naw chun thi rawi in ta, mi po po chungah lung- insen rawi a tih; in unauhai Israel sûngkuo pumpuiin LALPA isêm chawk mei chu sûn lem raw se."
7,"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.","Chun, intuokna puon in kawt- khâra chun in suok ding a ni nawh, chuong naw chun thîng in tih; LALPA hriek chu in chungah a um sih a,” a ta. Chuongchun, Mosie thu ang chun an thawh tah a."
8,"And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying,","LALPA chun Aron chu a biek a,"
9,"Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:","“Nang amanih, i naupasalhai amani khawmin, intuokna puon in sûnga in fe laiin uoin le zu hrim hrim dâwn naw ro, chuong naw chun thîng in tih; hi hi in thlahai chena kum- khaw dân ding nîng a tih."
10,"and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;","Chu chu ân thieng le ân thieng naw le, a thieng le a thieng naw in thlier theina ding le,"
11,and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by Moses.,"LALPAIN Mosie hmanga an kuoma a hril, thupêkhai po po chu Israel thlahai în chûktir theina dingin nîng a tih,” tiin."
12,"And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;","Mosie chun Aron le a naupasal la dam hai, Eleazar le Ithamar kuoma chun, “LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlâna mi, fâkmi thilin- hlân lâk mahlahai chu la unla, mâichâm bulah chawl ṭhangloin fa ro, thil inthieng a ni sih a."
13,"and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: for so I am commanded.",LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlâna i chanpuol le i naupa- salhai chanpuol a ni leiin hmun inthiengah in fâk ding a nih; chuong anga chu thu pêk ka nih.
14,"And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.",A ir thêna thên le a mal dawm- kânga inhlân ruok chu hmun faiah in fâk ding a nih; nang le i naupasalhai le i naunuhmeihai leh; Israel thlahai inremna thilinhlân inthâwinaa i chanpuol le i naupasalhai chanpuola ruot a ni sih a.
15,"The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, as a portion for ever; as Jehovah hath commanded.","A mal dawm kâng le a ir thên chu LALPA hmaa a thêna thên thilinhlân dingin mei hmanga thilin- hlân thâu leh an hung chawi ding a nih; chu chu nang le i naupasalhai leh kumkhuoa in chanpuol ding nîng a ta, LALPA thupêk ang khan,” a ta."
16,"And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,","Mosie chun suol inthâwina kêl chu nguntakin a zawng a; chun, ngai ta, an lo raw zo dêr tah a na; chuong- chun, Aron naupasal la dam Eleazar le Ithamar chunga chun a lungin- sen a,"
17,"Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?","“Iengdinga suol inthâwina chu hmun inthienga in fâk naw am a na? Hi hi thil inthieng tak, mipui rîtlona in phur theina dinga a pêk cheu, LALPA hmaa intlanna in isiempêk dinga a pêk cheu a ni sih a."
18,"Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.","Ngai ta u, a thisen chu hmun inthienga chun in lâk lût lêm; thu ka pêk ang khan hmun inthienga chun in fâk ngei ding a nih in sawnnaw,” tiin."
19,"And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Jehovah?","Chun, Aron chun Mosie kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, vawisûn hin LALPA hmaah an suol inthâwina le, an pum- rawhmang thilinhlân chu an inhlân a na, hieng ang thil hi ka chungah a hung um el ta sih a! Vawisûn hin suol inthâwina chu lo fa ta lang, LALPA mithmuah pawm tlâk a ni chuong ding am a nih?” a ta."
20,"And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight.",Mosien chu chu a hriet chun a lungawi tah a.
