8,"And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered.",Pumrawhmang thilinhlân in- hlânpêktu thiempu ngei chun pumrawhmang thilinhlâna a în- hlân vun chu a chang vawng ding a nih.
9,"And every meal-offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.","Chun, a zêunaa zêu fâkmi thilin- hlân taphawthai, a urnaa ur le thlêngdâra zêu po pohai chu ân hlântu thiempu chanpuol ding a nih."
10,"And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.","Fâkmi thilinhlân po po chu hrieka hmet khawm, a ṭâwl khawm a dang ang bawkin Aron naupasalhaiin an insem tlâng ding a nih."
11,"And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one shall offer unto Jehovah.","“Hi hi miin LALPA kuoma a înhlân ding, inremna thilinhlân inthâwina dân ding chu a nih:"
12,"If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked.","Lâwmthu hrilna dinga ân hlân chun, lâwmthu hril inthâwinaa chun hrieka hmet chawl ṭhanglo bei le, hrieka nâl chawl ṭhanglo beiphêk inphânhai le, hrieka hmet beiphit inditak inchie zawp ân hlân sa ding a nih."

14,And of it he shall offer one out of each oblation for a heave-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be the priest’s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings.,Chutaka mi chu thilinhlân tina mi LALPA kuoma thêna thilinhlân dingin pakhat seng inhlân a ta; inremna thilinhlân thisena thetu thiempu chanpuol ding a nih.
15,And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.,"Lâwmthu hrilna dinga inremna thilinhlân inthâwina sa chu, chu thilinhlân ân hlân ni ngei chun fâk zo ding a nih; zîngkâr chen iengkhawm a khêk ding a ni nawh."
16,"But if the sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it shall be eaten:","Amiruokchu, a thilinhlân in- thâwina chu thutiem amanih, mâni nuomthua thilinhlân amanih a ni chun, ân thâwina ân hlân ni ngei chun fâk ding a nih; fâk mahla chu a zîng tûka fâk ding a nih;"
17,but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.,"amiruokchu, inthâwina sa a ni thum ni chena la um ta rawp chu raw el ding a nih."
18,"And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.","A inremna thilinhlân inthâwina sa chu ni thum ni chena an fâk chun pawmpêk ni naw nih a, ân hlântu khawm chu inhlâna ngai ni naw bawk a tih; thil tirdakum nîng a ta, tukhawm a fa taphawt chun an khawhlona maw chu phur an tih."
19,"And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof:","“Sa, thil inthiengnaw hrim hrim le intâwk chu fâk ding a ni nawh a, raw el ding a nih. Sa chu ân thienghai po chun fa thei an ta,"
20,"but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.","inthienglo puma LALPA chan- puol inremna thilinhlân inthâwina sa fatu ruok chu, a chipuihai laia inthawka tuithlârin a um ding a nih."
21,"And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto Jehovah, that soul shall be cut off from his people.","Tukhawma thil inthiengnaw hrim hrim, mi inthiengnaw amanih, ran inthiengnaw amanih, thil tirdak- um pawrche hrim hrim a tâwk a, inremna thilinhlân inthâwina sa, LALPA chanpuol chu a fâk chun, ama chu a chipuihai laia inthawka tuithlârin a um ding a nih,” tiin."
22,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
23,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat.","“Israel thlahai chu hril la: Sebâwng amanih, berâm amanih, kêl amani thâu chu in fâk ding a ni nawh."
24,"And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it.","Mâniha thi thâu le sa ise thâu chu thil dang ienga khawm hmang thei nîng a ta, fâk ruok chu in fâk dêr ding a ni nawh."
25,"For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.","Tukhawm LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlâna inhlân sa thâu fatu chu, a chipuihai laia inthawkin tuithlârin a um ding a nih."
26,"And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings.","In umna taphawta chun thisen hrim hrim, vate amanih, ramsa amanih thisen chu in fâk ding a ni nawh."
27,"Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.","Tukhawm ni sienla, thisen fa hrim hrim chu, a chipuihai laia in- thawkin tuithlârin a um ding a nih,” tiin."
28,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie a biek a,"
29,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings unto Jehovah shall bring his oblation unto Jehovah out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings:","“Israel thlahai kuoma chun hril la: LALPA kuoma inremna thilinhlân inthâwina inhlân taphawt chun a thilinhlân chu LALPA kuomah a hung inhlân ding a nih; a inremna thil- inhlânhai inthâwinaa inthawk chun,"
30,"his own hands shall bring the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah.","ama kuthai ngeiin mei hmanga thil inhlânhai chu LALPA kuomah a hung chawi ding a na; a thâu chu a âwm pumin a hung lâk ding a nih, a âwm chu LALPA hmaa thên thilinhlâna thên a ni theina dingin."
31,And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.,Thiempu chun a thâu chu mâichâmah rawng a ta; a âwm ruok chu Aron le a naupasalhai chanpuol ding a nih.
32,And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.,"A mal changtieng chu, i in- remna thilinhlân hai inthâwinaa inthawka i thilinhlân dingin thiempu kuoma chun i pêk ding a nih;"
33,"He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion.","Aron naupasalhai laia mi, in- remna thilinhlânhaia thisen le thâu inhlântu chun, a mal changtieng chu ama chanpuol dingin a nei ding a nih."
34,"For the wave-breast and the heave-thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as their portion for ever from the children of Israel.","A âwm an ithên le a mal an inhlân hlak chu, Israel thlahai an inremna thilinhlân inthâwinahaia inthawkin ka lâkpêk a, Israel thlahai kumkhaw thaw dân dingah thiempu Aron le a naupasalhai ka pêk tah a nih."
35,"This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto Jehovah in the priest’s office;","Hi hi a nih, Aron le a nau- pasalhai chanpuol dinga, LALPA kuoma mei hmanga thilinhlânhaia inthawka sie hran, anni chu thiempu sin thawh a, LALPA rawngbâwl dinga inhlân an nia inthawka an chanpuol ding chu;"
36,"which Jehovah commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is their portion for ever throughout their generations.","anni chu hriek nâla an um niin, Israel mipuihaiin hi thil hi pe dingin LALPAIN thu a pêk tah a nih; hi hi an thlahai chena dinga kumkhaw thil phût chu a nih,” tiin."
37,"This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;","Hi hi, pumrawhmang thilinhlân dâm, fâkmi thilinhlân dâm, suol thâwina thilinhlân dâm, bawsiet in- thâwina thilinhlân dâm, inhlân inthiengna thilinhlân dâm, inremna thilinhlânhai dâm dinga,"
38,"which Jehovah commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai.","Sinai thlalêrah, an thilin- hlânhai chu, Israel mipuihai chun LALPA kuoma hung inhlân dinga thu a pêk nia, Sinai tlânga LALPAIN Mosie kuoma thu a pêk chu a nih."
