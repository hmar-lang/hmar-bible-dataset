1,"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;",A ni riet ni chun Mosie chun Aron le a naupasalhai le Israel upahai chu a ko a;
2,"and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah.","Aron kuoma chun, “Suol in- thâwina dingin bâwngte a chal, le pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin berâmchal demkailo ve ve kei la, LALPA hmaa chun inhlân rawh."
3,"And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;","Chun, Israel thlahai kuoma chun, ‘Suol inthâwina dingin kêlchal, pumrawhmang thilinhlân dingin bâwngte le berâmte kum khat mi ve ve demkailo ṭhieu,"
4,"and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you.","le bâwngchal le berâmchal LALPA hmaa inremna thilinhlân dinga inhlân dingin hung kei unla; hrieka hmet fâkmi thilinhlân leh, vawisûn hin in kuomah LALPA a hung inlang ding a nih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a ta."
5,And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.,"Chun, Mosien thu a pêk ang chun intuokna puon in tuola chun an hung kei a; chun, mi po po chun an va hnai a, LALPA hmaa chun an va ngîr a."
6,"And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you.","Mosie chun, “Hi hi a nih, in thaw dinga LALPAIN thu a pêk cheu kha; chuongchun, LALPA ropuina chu nangni lai hung inlang a tih,” a ta."
7,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Jehovah commanded.","Chun, Mosie chun Aron kuomah, “Mâichâm kha hung hnai la, i suol inthâwina dâm, i pumrawhmang thilinhlân dâm inhlân la; nangma ta ding le mipuihai ta dingin intlanna siem rawh; chun, mipuihai thilinhlân chu inhlân la, intlanna siempêk rawh, LALPAIN thu a pêk ta angin,” a tih a."
8,"So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.","Chun, Aron chun mâichâm chu a va hnai a, ama puola suol inthâwina bâwgte chu a that a."
9,"And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:","Aron naupasalhai chun thisen chu a kuoma chun an inhlân a, thisena chun a kutpâr chu ân chieh a, mâichâm kihaia chun a nâl a; thisen chu mâichâm bula chun a bunthlâk a;"
10,"but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","suol inthâwina thâu dâm, a kal dâm, a thin tuomtu duorda dâm chu mâichâm chunga chun a rawh a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang khan."
11,And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp.,A sa le a vun chu riebûk puoah a rawh a.
12,"And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu a that a, Aron naupasalhai chun thisen chu ama an pêk a, ama chun mâichâm chu a the huol a."
13,"And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.","Pumrawhmang thilinhlân sa tlin chu a tum tumin a lu leh an pêk a, ama chun mâichâma chun a lo rawh a."
14,"And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.","A sûnghai le a kehai chu a sâwp a, mâichâm chunga chun pumraw- hmang thilinhlân leh a rawh a."
15,"And he presented the people’s oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.","Chun, mipuihai thilinhlân chu ân hlân a; mipuihai ta dinga suol inthâwina kêl chu a kei a, a that a, a hmaa mi ang bawk khan suol inthâwina ding chun ân hlân a."
16,"And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu ân hlân a, a dân ang peiin ân hlân a nih."
17,"And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.","Chun, fâkmi thilinhlân chu ân hlân a, chutaka mi chu a vei khatin a lâk a, zingkâr pumrawhmang thilin- hlân ti naw khawm chu mâichâma chun a raw bawk a."
18,"He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,","Mipui puola inremna inthâwina thilinhlân bâwngchal le berâmchal chu a that bawk a; Aron naupasalhai chun a thisen chu an pêk a, mâichâm chu a the huol a."
19,"and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:","Bâwngchal thâu le berâmchal thâu dam, a mei thâu tak dâm, a rîlbawtu dâm, a kal dâm, a thin tuom- tu duorda dâm chu an pêk bawk a."
20,"and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:",A thâu chu a ir chunga chun an sieh a; ama chun a thâu chu mâi- châma chun a lo rawh a.
21,and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded.,"A ir le a mal changtieng ruok chu Aron chun LALPA hmaa thêna thilinhlân dingin a thên a, Mosie thupêk angin."
22,"And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.","Chun, Aron chun mipui tieng a bân a phar a, mal a sâwm tâwl a; suol inthâwina le pumrawhmang thilin- hlân le inremna thilinhlân ân hlân zo chun a hung ṭum a."
23,"And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people.","Chun, Mosie le Aron chu in- tuokna puon ina chun an va lût a; an hung suok nâwk a, mipuihai chu mal an sâwm a; chun, LALPA ropuina chu mi po po chunga chun a hung inlang tah a."
24,"And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.","LALPA hmaa inthawk chun mei a hung suok a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân le a thâuhai chu mâichâma chun a kâng hmang tah a; chu chu mipui po poin an hmu chun an khêk dur dur a, an bawkkhup ta ṭhuop a."
