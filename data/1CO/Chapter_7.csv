verse_no,en,hmr
1,Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.,"Chun, in thil ziek thuhai kha: Pasal ta dingin nuhmei tâwklo a ṭha a nih. “Pasalin nuhmei a nei naw chun a thaw ṭha a nih,” in tih a."
2,"But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.","Nisienlakhawm, inditnahai a um hlak leiin pasalin nuhmei bîk nei seng hai sienla, nuhmei khawmin pasal bîk nei seng raw hai se."
3,Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.,Pasal chun a nuhmei kuomah a chan ding tâwk chu pe raw se; chuong ang bawkin nuhmei khawma pasal kuomah a chan ding tâwk chu pe bawk raw se.
4,"The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.","Nuhmei chun ama taksa chungah thu a nei nawh a, a pasal chun thu a nei lem a nih; chuong ang bawkin pasal khawm chun mâni taksa chungah thu a nei nawh a, a nuhmei chun thu a nei lem a nih."
5,"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.","Ṭawngṭai dinga in inpêk theina ding le in inpâwl nâwk theina dingin sâwt nawtê kâr dinga rem in ti ve ve chau naw chun atu tu khawm insukdâwng naw ro, chuong naw chun, in insûm zo naw leiin Setanin thlêm a ti cheu."
6,"But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.","Nisienlakhawm, hi thu hi thupêk ang tienga ka hril a ni nawh a, phal tieng thua ka hril lem a nih."
7,"Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.","Nisienlakhawm, mi po po keia angtak hin um vawng hai sien ka nuom a nih. Amiruokchu, mi tinin Pathien kuoma inthawkin thilpêk mâni hmu zâwng an nei seng a nih; pakhatin kawng dangin, a dangin kawng dangin."
8,"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.","Nisienlakhawm, lêngṭulhai le hmeithaihai kuoma chun hi ka ti a nih; keia angtak hin um hai sien an ta dingin ṭhâng a tih."
9,"But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.","Insûm theina an nei naw chun innei el raw hai se, hur nêkin innei a ṭha lem sih a."
10,"But unto the married I give charge, yea not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband","Chun, innei sahai kuoma chun thu ka pêk (Keia pêk ruok chu ni loin Lalpa pêk a ni lem): Nuhmei chun a pasal ṭhe naw raw se;"
11,"(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.","nisienlakhawm, a ṭhe nghâl nghâl chun pasal nei ta loin um law law raw se, annawleh, a pasal le bawk inrem nâwk raw se; chun, pasal chun a nuhmei ma naw raw se."
12,"But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.","Mi dang kuoma ruok chun Lalpa ni loin keiin ka hril: Unau tûkhawmin nuhmei awilo mi nei sienla, ama chun a kuoma um zing a lungni phawt chun ma naw raw se."
13,"And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.","Chun, nuhmei pasal awilo mi nei chun, a pasalin a kuoma um zing a lungni phawt chun, ṭhe naw raw se."
14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.","Pasal awilo mi chu a nuhmei zârah sukthiengin a um a, nuhmei awilo mi khawm chu a pasal zâra sukthiengin a um bawk a nih; chuong ang chu ni naw sien chu in nauhai chu inthieng naw nihai; nisienla- khawm, an inthieng zing a nih."
15,"Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us in peace.","Nisienlakhawm, a awinaw lemin a ṭhe chun ṭhe el raw se, chuong anga chun chu unaupa amanih, farnu amanih hrên an ni ta nawh. Pathien ruok chun inremnaah a mi ko a nih."
16,"For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?","Aw nuhmei, i pasal i sandam ding le ding naw iengtin am i hriet leh? Aw pasal, i nuhmei i sandam ding le ding naw iengtin am i hriet leh?"
17,"Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, Lalpa chun mi tin kuoma a sem pângngai ang seng le, Pathienin mi tin a kona pângngai ang sengah um raw se. Chuong ang chun kohranhai po poah ka ruot hlak."
18,Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.,Sertan ta hnung ko an um am? Sertan naw mi ni naw raw se. Sertan loa um ko an um am? Ser intantir naw raw se.
19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.","Pathien thupêkhai pawm chau naw chu sertan hi iengkhawm a ni nawh a, sertan naw khawm iengkhawm a ni chuong nawh."
20,Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.,Mi tin koa an um laia an chan pângngaia chun um zing seng raw se.
21,"Wast thou called being a bondservant? care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use it rather.",Suoka i um ko am i nih? chu chu ngaituo nuom naw rawh; i suok thei si ruok chun hmang lem rawh.
22,"For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant.","Suoka um Lalpaa ko chu Lalpa insuoktir suok a ni sih a, chuong ang bawk chun suok ni loa koa um chu Krista suok a nih."
23,Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.,Mana inchâwk in ni tah; mihriemhai suokah lût naw ro.
24,"Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.","Unauhai, mi tin koa in um laia in chan pângngaia chun Pathien kuomah um zing seng ro."
25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.","Chun, nunghâk inthieng tieng thua ruok chun Lalpa thupêk hrim ka nei nawh a; nisienlakhawm, ringuma um dinga Lalpa kuoma inthawka lunginsietna hmu ka ni leiin ka ngaituo ang hril ka tih."
26,"I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is.","Chuongchun, tulai rinumna lei hin hi hi ṭhain ka ring, mi a um ngaia a um zing hi."
27,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.,Nuhmeia khuopde i ni am a nih? Sûtna zawng naw rawh. Nuhmeia khuopde naw i ni am? Nuhmei zawng naw rawh.
28,"But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.","Nisienlakhawm, nuhmei i nei chun thil i suksuol nawh, nunghâk inthieng khawma pasal a nei chun thil a suksuol chuong nawh. Amiruokchu, chuong ang mi chun tisaa chun rinum tuor a tih, nisienla- khawm, kei ruok chun intuortir naw cheu ka nuom a nih."
29,"But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;","Amiruokchu, unauhai, hi hi ka ti a nih; hun hi suktâwiin a um a nih, tuta hnung chu, nuhmei neihai chu neinaw anga an um theina ding le,"
30,"and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;","ṭaphai chu ṭapnawhai anga an um theina ding le, lâwmhai chu lâwmnaw anga an um theina ding le; inchawtuhai chu neinaw anga an um theina ding le,"
31,"and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.",khawvêl hmangtuhai chu hmang taluo loa an um theina dingin; hi khawvêl umdan hi a bohmang mêk a nih.
32,"But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:","Nisienlakhawm, lungkham nei loa in um ka nuom pêk cheu a nih, nuhmei neinaw chun Lalpa suklâwm theina ding zie ngaituoin Lalpa tieng thil chu a lungkham hlak."
33,"but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,",Nuhmei nei ruok chun a nuhmei suklâwm theina dingzie ngaituoin khawvêl tieng thil chu a lungkham lem hlak.
34,"and is divided. So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.","Chun, pasal nei le nunghâk inthieng chu an inang bawk nawh a; pasal neinaw chun a taksa le a thla- raua inthiengtaka a um theina dingin Lalpa tieng thil chu a lungkham hlak a, pasal nei ruok chun a pasal suk- lâwm theina dingzie ngaituoin khawvêl tieng thil a lungkham lem hlak."
35,"And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.","Chuong chu nangni ṭhatna dinga ka hril a nih; hruia ka khit theina ding cheua ka hril a ni nawh a, umdân mawi tâwka in um theina ding le, Lalpa rawng chu buoi loa in bâwl theina dingin ka hril lem a nih."
36,"But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.","Amiruokchu, tûkhawmin a nau nunghâk inthieng ân lêng sâwttir kawnga a sukdik naw a ân hriet chun, ama chu a vânglai a na, a ṭul bawk si chun a thaw nuom chu thaw raw se, thil a suksuol nawh, inneitir el raw se."
37,"But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own will, and hath determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, shall do well.","Nisienlakhawm, lungril dettak puta, ṭul ti loa, ama nuom zâwng ruok chu hlen theia, a nau nunghâk inthieng chu kawl zing a lungrila tum tlattu chun thaw ṭha lem a tih."
38,So then both he that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.,"Chuongchun, pasal inneitirtu chun a thaw ṭha, nisienlakhawm ân neitir nawtu chun a thawṭha nâwk zuol a nih."
39,"A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.","Nuhmei chu a pasal dam sûng po po chu phuor a na; nisienlakhawm, a pasal a thi ta chun a nuom nuom nei thei a tih; amiruokchu, Lalpaa um mi a ni ding a nih."
40,"But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.","Nisienlakhawm, keia ngai chun, a um ngaia a um zing chun hamṭha lem a tih; kei khawm Pathien Thlarau chu nei ve bawkin kân ring a nih."
