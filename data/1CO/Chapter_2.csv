verse_no,en,hmr
1,"And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.","Chun, kei chu unauhai, Pathien thurûk hril cheuva in kuoma ka hung lai khan ka thu hril ropui le varna ropui le hung ka ni nawh a,"
2,"For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",Isu Krista ama ngei hemdea a um thu chau naw chu nangni lai ieng dang khawm hriet ka tum nawh kha.
3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.","Chun, hrâtnaw le ṭiin, nasataka inthin pumin in kuomah ka um a."
4,"And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:","Ka ṭawngbau suok le ka thu hrilhai chu thu vara thlêmna thu a ni nawh a, Thlarau le thilthawtheina inhriettirin a ni lem kha;"
5,"that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.","in ringna chu mihriem varnaa innghat loa, Pathien thilthawtheinaa innghata a um lemna dingin."
6,"We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:","Amiruokchu, puitlinghai lai chu thu var kan hril hlak; nisien- lakhawm, hi khawvêl thu var chu a ni nawh, hi khawvêl rorêltu bohmang dinghai thu var chu a ni bawk nawh;"
7,"but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:","Pathien thu var thurûk chu kan hril lem hlak a nih, thu var inthup, ei ropuina dinga Pathienin khawvêl um hmaa a ruot lâwk ta chu."
8,"which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:","Chu chu hi khawvêl rorêltuhai hrim hrimin an hriet nawh, hre hai sien chu ropuina Lalpa chu hemde naw ni hai."
9,"but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And which entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.","“Mita hmu ngai naw le naa hriet ngai naw, Mihriem lungrila lût ngai naw, Pathienin ama hmangaituhai ta dinga A buotsai taphawt chu,” ti ziek ang lem khan."
10,"But unto us God revealed them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.","Keini ruok chu chuong chu Pathienin Thlarauin a mîn hriettir tah a nih; Thlarau chun iengkim a suisuok hlak sih a; anih, Pathien thu inril khawm."
11,"For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.","Mihriem thuhai chu mihriem lungril, a sûnga um bawk naw chun tuin am hrieng a ta? Chuong ang bawkin Pathien thuhai chu Pathien Thlarau bawk naw chun tûkhawmin an hriet nawh."
12,"But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.","Chuongchun, a thlâwna Pa- thien thil mi pêkhai chu ei hriet theina dingin, eini chun khawvêl thlarau ni loin, Thlarau Pathien kuoma inthawk chu ei hmu lem a nih."
13,"Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual words.","Mihriem varna inchûktir thua hril loin, Thlarau inchûktir thua hril lemin Thlarau tieng thuhai chu thlarau tieng mihai kuoma hrilfiein, chuong thil a mi pêkhai thu khawm chu kan hril hlak."
14,"Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.","Khawvêl mi chun Pathien Thlarau thil chu a lâwm ngai nawh, ama ngaia chun invêtthlâk a ni sih a; Thlaraua hriet chieng a ni leiin a hriet thei naw hrim a nih."
15,"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.","Thlarau mi ruok chun thil iengkim a hriet chieng hlak, ama hlak chu tûkhawmin an hriet chieng si nawh."
16,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.",Tûin am Lalpa lungril hre taa ama inchûktir thei ding? Eini ruok chun Krista lungril ei put a nih.
