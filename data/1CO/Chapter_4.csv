3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.","Nisienlakhawm, nangniin in mi fiena le, mihriem ngaituonain in mi fiena chu ka ta dingin thil chîterek ang a nih, kei le kei khawm kân fie ngai bawk nawh."
4,For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.,"Iengkhawm indemna ding kân hriet si nawh a, nisienlakhawm, chu chun thiem a mîn changtir chuong nawh, a mi fietu chu Lalpa a ni lem."
5,"Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.","Chuongchun, a hun hma hin iengkhawm fie naw ro, Lalpa hung hmakhat chu, ama chun inthima thil thuphmanghai chu varah hung la suok a tih, lungrila tumhai khawm chu suklang bawk a tih; chu pha chun mi tinin Pathien kuoma chun an chantâwka inpâkna hlaw seng tâng an tih."
6,"Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not to go beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.","Chun, unauhai, thu ziekhai chu in hmu khûm nawna dingin, keinia hin in inchûk theina dingin, chuong thuhai chu in ṭhatna dingin kei le Appolo kân bel a nih, nangni laia tûkhawmin pakhat suonga pakhat in uongkhum nawna dingin."
7,"For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?",Nang tûin am a sukdanglam chuong cheh a?

8,"Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.","Tuta inthawkin in tlai tah a, tuta inthawkin in hausa tah a, kan ṭhang loin ro in rêl a ni ta hi! Anih, ro rêl tak tak unla kan nuom a nih, keini khawma nangni le ro kan rêl theina dingin."
9,"For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.",Pathienin keini tirkohai hi thi dinga ruot tasa angin a nu- hnungtakah a mi târsuok angah ka ngai a nih; khawvêl le vântirkohai le mihriemhai mithmuah ennuoma siemin kan um hi.
10,"We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.","Keini chu Krista leiin mi invêt kan nih, nangni ruok chu Kristaa chun mi var in ni lem a nih! Keini chu kan hrât nawh a, nangni ruok chu in hrât a nih! Nangni chu mi inpâkin in um a, keini ruok chu mi hmusitin kan um a nih."
11,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;","Tu chen khawm hin, kan phîng a ṭâmin kan dang a châr a, silfên kan khawp nawh a, mi kut inthak nûlna kan na, umna bulbâl kan nei nawh a,"
12,"and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;","mâni kuta sin thawin kan inrim hle hlak a, miin an mi halin mal kan sâwmpêk a, miin an mi suknawmna leh kan tuor fan fan a;"
13,"being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.","miin an mi hrilsiet leh zaidam- takin kan hril hlak, tu chen khawm hin khawvêl hnâwlhnawk, thil po po hmunhnawk angin an mi siem a nih."
14,"I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.","Sukzak ding cheuin hieng thu hi ka ziek nawh a, ka nau dittakhai anga infuina ding cheuin ka ziek lem a nih."
15,"For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.",Kristaa chun inchûktirtu sîng khat nei unla khawm pa chu tamtak in nei si naw a nih; keiin Krista Isua chun Chanchin Ṭhain ka nei cheu a ni kha.
16,"I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.","Chuongchun, mîn chûk dingin ka ngên cheu a nih."
17,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.","Chuleichun, Timothe, Lalpaa ka nau dittak le ringum chu in kuomah ka hung tir a nih, ama chun Kristaa ka umdân ram tina kohran tina ka închûktir hlak ang hi inhriettir nâwk a ti cheu."
18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.","Chun, kei in kuoma hung nâwk ta naw ding ang elin ṭhenkhat in uong a nih."
19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpain rem a ti chun, sâwtnawtê hnungah in kuomah hung ka tih; chuongchun, mi uonghai thu chu ni loin, an thil- thawtheina chu hre lem tâng ka tih."
20,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.","Pathien ram chu thuah a um nawh a, thilthawtheinaah a um lem a nih."
21,"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?","A ieng am in nuom lem? Hmawltum leh am a ni in kuomah ka hung ding, hmangaina le thuhnuoi- rawl lungril putin?"
