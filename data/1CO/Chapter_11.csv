verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.","Keiin Krista ka entawn angtak hin, nangni khawmin mi entawn ve ro."
2,"Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.","Iengkima in mi hriet zing lei le, thurosiehai ka hung hril angtaka in la vawng tlat leiin kân pâk cheu a nih."
3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.","Nisienlakhawm, pasal taphawt lu chu Krista a na, nuhmei lu chu a pasal a na, chun Krista lu chu Pathien a nih, ti in hrietchieng ka nuom a nih."
4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.","Pasal tukhawm, lukhum khum puma ṭawngṭai amani, thuhril amani phawt chun, ama lu chu a sukmuolpho a nih."
5,But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.,"Amiruokchu, nuhmei tukhawm, lu inkhum lova ṭawngṭai amani, thu a hril amani chun, a lu a sukmuolpho a nih, ama chu a lu mêt kawl leh thuhmun a nih."
6,"For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.","Nuhmeiin a lu ân khum si naw chun, a sam chu tan tâwi lem el raw se; nisienlakhawm, nuhmei ta dingin sam tan amani, mêt kawl amani chu thil inzakum a ni si leiin, a lu inkhum raw se."
7,"For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.","Pasal ruok chu Pathien angpui le a ropuina a ni leiin, a lu ân khum ding a ni nawh a, nuhmei ruok chu pasal ropuina suklangtu a nih."
8,For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:,"Pasal hi nuhmeia inthawka siem a ni nawh a, nuhmei ruok chu pasala inthawka siem a ni lem sih a."
9,for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:,"Pasal hi nuhmei ta dinga siem a ni nawh a, nuhmei ruok chu pasal ta dinga siem a nih."
10,"for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.","Vântirkohai leiin, nuhmei chu a pasal thuhnuoia um a nih ti inchikna dingin a lu ân khum ding a nih."
11,"Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpaa chun nuhmei hi pasal ṭhang lovin a um thei nawh a, pasal khawm nuhmei ṭhang lovin a um thei bawk nawh."
12,"For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.","Nuhmei hi pasala inthawka siem a ni ang bawk hin, pasal khawm chu nuhmeia inthawka pieng a ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, thil po po hi Pathiena inthawka suok vawng an nih."
13,Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?,Nangni ngei khan ngaituo hman ro: Nuhmeiin a lu inkhum lova Pathien kuoma a ṭawngṭai hi a âwm rêng rêng am a ni?
14,"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?","Pasalin sam sei a put chun, a ta dingin thil inzakum a nih ti in piengpui lungril khawmin ân hriettir naw cheu am a ni?"
15,"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.","Nuhmeiin a sam a hla sei ruok chun, chu chu ama ropuina a nih, a sam chu inkhumna dinga pêk a ni sih a."
16,"But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.","Tukhawmin, hi thu hi a lo sêl a ni khawmin, chuong thila chun keinîn thawdân kan nei nawh a, Pathien kohranhai khawma an nei bawk nawh."
17,"But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.","Amiruokchu, hieng thil inchûktirnahaia hin chu kân pâk thei naw cheu a nih, in inkhâwm pha ṭhatpui nêkin in sietpui lem hlak leiin."
18,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.","A hmasatakin, kohran anga in inkhâwm chângin nangni lai inṭhena a um hlak ti thu ka lo hriet sih a; iemani chenah ka ring deu bawk a nih."
19,"For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.",Nangni laia mi indiktakhai an inlang theina dingin pâwl tum tum an hung um ding hrim a nih.
20,"When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper:","In fe khâwm phaa in fâk hlak hi, Lalpa zânbu a ni naw tawp el."
21,"for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.","Fâk hun a tlung pha leh, mi tinin mani bu seng in lo fâk el hlak sih a, chuongchun pakhat phîngṭâmin a um a, pakhat ân rui hlak."
22,"What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.","Ieng am an ta leh! Fâk le dâwnna dingin in in nei seng an naw am a ni? Annawleh, Pathien kohran hmusitin, iengkhawm nei nawhai chu in sukzak el hlak am a ni? In kuomah ieng am ka hril ding a na? Kân pâk ding cheu am a ni? Hi thila hin chun kân pâk thei naw cheu."
23,"For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;","Ka thu hril sâwng cheu kha Lalpa kuoma inthawka ka dawng a na; khânga inmantira a um zân khan, Lalpa Isûn, bei a lâk a,"
24,"and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.","lâwmthu a hril zovin, a khawi a, “Hi hi ka taksa, in ta ding chu a nih. In mi hriet zingna dingin hi hi thaw hlak ro,” a ti kha."
25,"In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.","Chuong ang bawkin, zânbu fâk zovin, no khawm chu a lâk a, “Hi hi ka thisena Thuthlung Thar chu a nih. In dâwn povin in mi hriet zingna dingin thaw hlak ro,” a ti kha."
26,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.","Chu bei chu in fâk a, no chu in dâwn zâtin, Lalpa hung nâwk hmakhat a thina chu in puong hlak a ni sih a."
27,"Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.","Chuleiin, tukhawm tlâklo puma bei chu faa, Lalpa no chu dâwn taphawt chun, Lalpa taksa le thisen chungah suol-maw phur a tih."
28,"But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.","Mi tin mani infie seng sienla, chuong ang chun bei chu fain no chu dâwn raw se."
29,"For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.","A fatu le a dâwntu chun, Lalpa taksa chîktaka a ngaituo si naw chun, ama chunga rorêlna intlun dingin a fâkin a dâwn a ni sih a."
30,"For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.","Hi lei hin nangni laia tamtak chu, in hrâtnawin in hrivawi a sie a nih, ṭhenkhat chu in thi tah a."
31,"But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.","Amiruokchu, chîktakin inngaituo hlak unla chu, ro rêlpêkin ei um naw ding bah."
32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.","Rorêlpêka ei um khawmin, khawvêl mihai anga thiemnaw changa ei um nawna dingin Lalpa thununin ei um hlak a nih."
33,"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.","Chuleiin, ka unauhai, fa dinga in inkhâwm pha, innghâk tâwl hlak ro."
34,"If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.","In inkhâwm chu thiemnaw in chang phana a ni nawna dingin, a phîngṭâm chun inah hung fa zet raw se. Thil danghai chungchâng chu ka hung pha leh la kâwkhmûng ka ti cheu."
