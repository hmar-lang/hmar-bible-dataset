verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,","Chun, unauhai, Chanchin Ṭha ka hril cheu kha inhriettir nâwk ka ti cheu; chu Chanchin Ṭha chu in lâwm a, chutaka bawk chun in ngîr a;"
2,"by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.","ka thu hril cheu kha in awi mei mei a ni nawh a, in pawm tlat a ni chun, chutaka bawk chun sandam mêkin in um a nih."
3,For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;,"A hmasatakin, ka ihmu ve bawk chu ka hril sâwng cheu kha; khânga Krista chu Pathien Lekha thu hril ang peia ei suolhai leia a thi a,"
4,and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;,"an phûm a, Pathien Lekha thu ang peiin ni thum nia keithoin a um a."
5,and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;,"Kipha kuomah a hung inlâr dâm kha; chun, sâwm le pahnihai kuomah ân lâr nâwk a."
6,"then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;",Chu hnunga chun unau za nga nêka tam lai ân lâr nawk a; chuhai laia mi tam lem chu tu chen hin an la dam rawp a; ṭhenkhat ruok chu an in tah a.
7,then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;,"Chun, Jakob kuomah ân lâr nâwk a, chu hnung chun tirkohai po po kuomah;"
8,"and last of all, as to the child untimely born, he appeared to me also.","chun, a tâwptaka chun, a hun nawa pieng ang keima kuoma khawm ân lâr a."
9,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.","Kei chu tirko laia chîntak, Pathien kohranhai ka suknawmna leia tirkoa inbûk tlâklo ka ni sih a."
10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien lung- insietna leiin ka ni ni ka ni tah; chun, a lunginsietna a mi pêk chu a thlâwnin a um nawh a, chuong nêk hmanin anni po po nêkin ka thaw nasa lem kha; nisienlakhawm, keia khâtin ka thaw nawh a, Pathien lunginsietna ka kuoma um khan a thaw lem a nih."
11,"Whether then it be I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, kei khawmin, anni khawmin khâng ang khan kan hril hlak a, nangniin khâng khan in awi bawk a."
12,"Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?","Chun, Krista thu: mithi laia inthawka keithoin a um ti an hril si chun, iengtiziea nangni laia ṭhen- khatin “Mithi thonâwkna hrim hrim a um nawh” in ti?"
13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:",Mithi thonâwkna hrim hrim a um naw chun Krista khawm kha keithoin um naw ni;
14,"and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.","chun, Krista chu keithoa a um si naw chun, kan thu hril hi iengkhawm ni naw nih a, in awi khawm ieng- khawm ni naw ni."
15,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.","Anih, Krista a keitho ti Pathien kan hrietpui lei khan, Pathien tieng thuah hrietpuitu khelhlip lo ni bawk kan tih — Mithihai keithoa an um naw chun, ama khawm keitho da ni ie."
16,"For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:","Mithihai keithoin an um si naw chun, Krista khawm kha keithoin um si naw ni,"
17,"and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.","chun, Krista kha keithoa a um naw chun, in iâwi chu iengkhawm ni naw ni, in suolnaa chun in la um zing nîng a tih."
18,Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.,"Chuong chu a ni chun, Kristaa in tahai kha an bohmang tah nîng a tih."
19,"If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.",Tulai dam sûng chaua Krista chunga beiseina nei ei ni chun mi po poa lungsietumtak lo nîng ei tih.
20,"But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.","Nisienlakhawm, Krista chu mithi laia inthawkin keithoin a um tak zet a nih, a inhai tho hmaṭhuoitu a lo ni tah."
21,"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.",Mihriem leia thina a lo um leiin mihriem lei bawkin mithi thonâwkna a lo um ta bawk a.
22,"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.","Adama chun mi po po an thi hlak angin, Kristaa chun mi po po sukhringin um bawk an tih."
23,"But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ’s, at his coming.","Nisienlakhawm, mâni hun seng peiah, keitho ning an tih: ahmasa takin Krista, tho hmathuoitu; chu hnungah, a hung phaleh Ama tahai po."
24,"Then cometh the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.","Chu hnunga chun a tâwp chu la hung tlung a tih, chu pha chun rorêlnahai po po le thuneina thil- thawtheina po pohai a sukbo hnungin, Pathien kuomah, Pa kuoma ngei chun ram chu pêng a tih;"
25,"For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.",a hmêlmahai po po a ke hnuoia a sie hmakhat chu ama chu lala um ding hrim a ni sih a.
26,The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.,Hmêlma nuhnungtak sukboa um ding chu thina hi a nih.
27,"For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.","“Ama chun a ke hnuoiah iengkim a sie sih a”; nisienlakhawm, “A hnuoiah iengkim siein a um”, ti hin, a hnuoia iengkim sietu chu a ṭhang ve nawh ti ân lang zing a nih."
28,"And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.","Chun, a hnuoia iengkim siea a um pha chun, Naupa ngei khawm chu a hnuoia iengkim sietu hnuoia siein um bawk a tih, Pathien chu iengkima iengkim a ni theina dingin."
29,"Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?","Chuong ang a ni naw chun, mithi puola baptisma changhai chu iengtin am thâwng an ta? Mithihai chu keithoa an um dêr si naw ding chun, iengdinga anni puola baptisma an chang hlak?"
30,why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?,Iengleiin am eini khawm hi dârkâr tina inlaua ei um hlak am a na?
31,"I protest by that glorying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.","Unauhai, ei Lalpa Isu Kristaa ka suongna cheu chu sâlin, “Ni tinin ka thi hlak,” ka ti a nih."
32,"If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.","Mihriem thaw dân ang ringawt- a Ephesia sahrânghai kha insuolpui ka ni chun, ka ta dingin ieng am ṭhahnem a ta? mithi keithoa an um naw ding chun, fain dâwn ei tiu, zîngah ei thi el ding annâwm."
33,Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.,"Hlêmin um naw ro, “Ruol rilo- haiin nungchang ṭha an suk- khawhlo hlak.”"
34,"Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak this to move you to shame.","Feltakin har unla, suksuol naw ro; ṭhenkhat chun Pathien hrietna hrim in nei naw hi; hi hi in inzakna dinga ka hril a nih."
35,"But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?","Nisienlakhawm, tuin amanih, “Mithi hai chu iengtin am keithoin um an ta? taksa ieng ang putin am hung an ta?” a ti a ni thei a."
36,"Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:","Nang mi invêt, nang ngeiin i tu hlak khawm hi, a thi zet naw chun sukhringin a um ngai lem,"
37,"and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;","chun, i tu hlak khawm hi a taksa la um ding chu i tu nawh a, a mal el i tu lem hlak a, bu mal amanih, chi dang mal amani khawm a ni thei a;"
38,"but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.","nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ama nuom ang peiin taksa a pêk hlak, a mal tin kuomah mani taksa seng chu."
39,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.","Tisa po po hi tisa chi khat an ni nawh a; mihriem tisa a dang a, sa tisa a dang a, vate tisa a dang a, nga tisa a dang a nih."
40,"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.","Vân taksahai a um a, hnuoi taksahai khawm; nisienlakhawm, vân taksa ropuina chu a dang a, hnuoi taksa ropuina chu a dang a nih."
41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.","Nisa ropuina chu a dang a, thla ropuina chu a dang a, arasihai ropui- na chu a dang a, arasi le arasi khawm ropuinaa chun an inang si nawh."
42,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:,"Mithi thonâwkna khawm hi chuong ang bawk chu a nih. Hmawn theia tuin a um a, hmawntheiloa keithoin a um;"
43,it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:,"chawimawiloa tuin a um a, ropuitaka keithoin a um; hrâtloa tuin a um a, thilthawtheina neia keithoin a um;"
44,"it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.","mihriem tieng taksaa tuin a um a, Thlarau tieng taksaa keithoin a um, mihriem tieng taksa a um chun thlarau tieng taksa khawm um a tih."
45,"So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.","Chuong ang bawkin, “Mihriem hmasatak Adam chu mi hring a hung nih,” ti ziek a nih; Adam nuhnung lem chu hringna petu thlarau a nih."
46,"Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.","Nisienlakhawm, thlarau tieng chu a um hmasa nawh a, mihriem tieng chu a um hmasa lem; chu hnunga chun thlarau tieng chu a um."
47,"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.",Mihriem hmasatak chu hnuoia mi pila siem a nih; mihriem pahnina chu vâna mi a nih.
48,"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.","Hnuoia siem mi ang kha, hnuoia siem mihai khawm hi an nih; vâna mi ang kha vân mihai khawm chu an nih."
49,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.","Chun, hnuoia siem mi puona kha ei nei ang bawkin vâna mi puona chu ei nei bawk ding a nih."
50,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.","Unauhai, “Tisa le thisen hin Pathien ram hluo thei naw nih a, hmawn thei hin hmawntheilo chu hluo chuong bawk naw ni” ti ka hril a ni hi."
51,"Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,","Ngai ta u, thurûk ka hril ding cheu a ni hi; ei rêngin in kher nâwm ei nih a,"
52,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.","nisienlakhawm, ei rêngin tawtawrâwt nuhnungtak inri pha chun sâwt nawtêa, mitkhap kâr loa sukdanglamin um vawng tâng ei tih; tawtawrâwt chu ân ri ding a ni sih a; chuongchun, mithihai chu hmawn- theiloa keithoin um an ta, eini khawm sukdanglamin um tâng ei tih."
53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.","Hi hmawnthei hin hmawntheilo a sil ding a na, hi thi thei khawm hin thi theinawna a sil bawk ding a nih."
54,"But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.","Chuongchun, hi hmawnthei hin hmawntheinawna a sila, hi thithei hin thitheinawna a sil pha chun, “Hnenain thina a lem zo tah,”"
55,"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?","“Aw thina, i hnena chu khâwlai am a um tah a? Aw thina, i tûr chu khâwlai am a um tah a?” ti thuziek hi hung tlung tâng a tih."
56,The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:,"Thina tûr chu suol a na, suol thilthawtheina chu dân thu chu a nih."
57,"but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.","Nisienlakhawm, ei Lalpa Isu Krista zâra hnena mi petu Pathien kuoma chun lawmthu um raw se."
58,"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.","Chuleichun, ka unau dittakhai, dettakin, sukchâng ruolloin Lalpa sin ṭhahnem ngaitaka thaw rawpin um ro, in inrimna chu Lalpaa chun a thlâwn ngai nawh ti in hriet sih a."
