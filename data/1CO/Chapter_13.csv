1,"If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.","Mihriem ṭawnghai le vântirko ṭawnghaiin thu hril lang khawm, hmangaina ka nei si naw chun dâr inri mei mei amanih, dârbenthek inri mei mei amanih lo nîng ka tih."
2,"And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.","Chun, thu hril theina neiin, thurûk po po le hrietna po po hre vawng lang khawm, tlâng sawn theina khawp hiel ringna famkim nei lang khawm, hmangaina ka nei si naw chun iengkhawm ni naw ning."
3,"And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.","Chun, mi rimsihai châwmna dingin ka sum po po khawm pe vawng lang, ka taksa khawm kâng dingin inpe lang hmangaina ka nei si naw chun, ka ta dingin iengkhawm ṭhahnem naw ni."
4,"Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,","Hmangaina chu a dawthei a, ngil a nei a, hmangainain a îtthîk nawh a; hmangaina ama le ama ân pak ngai nawh a, a uong nawh a,"
5,"doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;","a châng mawinaw ngai nawh a, mâni hma a siel nawh a, a lunginsen nuom nawh a, suol tiengah a ngaituo nawh a,"
6,"rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;","felnawna a lâwm nawh a, thutak ruok chu a lâwmpui hlak;"
7,"beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.","iengkim a tuor hrâm hrâm a, iengkim a ring a, iengkim a beisei a, iengkim a tuor suo hlak."
8,"Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away.","Hmangaina hi iengtik khawm bo naw nih a; amiruokchu, thuhrilna dâm hi um sienla khawm sukbân la nîng a tih; ṭawng hrietlohai dâm hi um sien khawm la mâng a tih, hrietna hi um sienkhawm sukbân la nîng a tih."
9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;","A kim loin ei hriet a, a kim loin thu ei hril bawk hlak a nih;"
10,"but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.",a famkim a hung tlung pha ruok chun a kimnaw hi bân ni tâng a tih.
11,"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.","Ka naupang laiin naupang angin ka ṭawng a, naupang hrietin ka hriet a, naupang ngaituo angin ka ngaituo hlak; tuta ka hung puitling hnung hin naupang thaw dân chu ka bân tah."
12,"For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.","Tuhin chu hlimenah ei hmu rei ruoi a nih, chu chu pha ruok chun inhmatuoin ni tâng a tih. Tuhin chu a kim loin ei hriet a, chu pha ruok chun hriet kim ka ni ang bawk hin hre kim tâng ka tih."
13,"But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.","Chuongchun, hienghai pathum, ringna dâm, beiseina dâm, hmangaina dâm hi um zing a tih; chun, a hi poa a ropuitak chu hmangaina hi a nih."
