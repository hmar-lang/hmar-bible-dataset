2,and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;,"an rênga sûma le tuisuorieta khawm Mosie bêl dinga baptisa an um vawng a,"
3,and did all eat the same spiritual food;,"an rêngin thlarau tieng bu hmunkhat khawm an fâk seng a,"
4,and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.,an rêngin thlarau tieng dâwn ding hmunkhat khawm an dâwn seng kha; anni zuitu thlarau tieng lungpuia kha an dâwn seng kha; chu lungpui chu Krista a nih.

9,"Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.","Anni laia mi ṭhenkhatin Lalpa an fieh a, rûla sukbohmanga an um pha ang khan Lalpa chu fie nâwng ei tiu."
10,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.","Anni laia ṭhenkhat an chier a, sukbohmangtu sukbohmanga an um ang khan chier naw bawk ei tiu."

29,"conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?","nang a sie le ṭha hrietna ka ti nawh a, mi dang sie le ṭha hrietna chu ka ti lem a nih. Iengdinga mi dang sie le ṭha hrietna chun ka zalênna a sawisêl am a na?"
