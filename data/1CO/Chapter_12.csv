1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.","Chun, unauhai, thlarau tieng thilpêk thuhai chu in hriet naw ka nuom nawh."
2,"Ye know that when ye were Gentiles ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.","Awinawhai in ni lai khan, ieng ang khawma an ṭhuoi ang pei cheu khan, khâng milim rawl neilo tienga khan ṭhuoihmangin in um ti in hriet a."
3,"Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.","Chuleiin, tûkhawmin Pathien thlaraua thu hrilin, “Isu chu ṭawng- sephur a nih,” an ti ngai nawh; chun, tûkhawmin Thlarau Inthienga chau naw chun, “Isu chu Lalpa a nih,” an ti thei ngai nawh ti kân hriettir cheu."
4,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.","Chun, thilpêk chu a tum tum a um a, Thlarau chu hmunkhat a nih."
5,"And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.","Rawngbâwl dân tum tum khawm a um a; nisienlakhawm, Lalpa chu hmunkhat a nih."
6,"And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.","Sinthaw dân tum tum khawm a um a, Pathien ruok chu hmunkhat a nih, mi po poa iengkim thawtu chu."
7,But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.,"Chun, ṭhathnempui tlâng seng dingin Thlarau inhriettirna chu mi tin kuomah pêk seng a nih."
8,"For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:",Mi pakhat kuomah Thlaraua chun varna thu pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah chu Thlarau thu ma chun hrietna pêk a nih;
9,"to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;","chun, mi dang kuomah chu Thlaraua bawk chun, ringna pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah Thlarau thuhmuna chun sukdam theina pêk a nih;"
10,and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:,"mi dang kuomah thilmak thaw- theina pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah thuhril theina pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah thlarauhai hriet dik theina pêk a nih; chun, mi dang kuomah ṭawng hrietlo chi dang danghaia thuhril theina pêk a nih; mi dang kuomah ṭawng hrietlohai hrilfie theina pêk a ni sih a;"
11,"but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.","nisienlakhawm, chuong po po chu Thlarau thuhmun bawk chun, mi tin kuomah a nuom ang peia semin sin a thaw hlak."
12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.","Taksa hi pakhat a na, pêng tamtak a nei a, taksa pênghai po po chu tam hai sienkhawm taksa pum- khat an ni sih a; Krista chu chuong ang bawk chu a nih."
13,"For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.","Ei rêngin, Judahai amanih, Grikhai amanih, suok amanih, suok nilo amanih taksa pumkhata um dingin, Thlarau pakhat chauah bap- tisin ei um seng sih a. Thlarau pakhat chau bawk a mîn dâwntir bawk a."
14,"For the body is not one member, but many.","Taksa hi pêng khat chau a ni si nawh a, pêng tamtak a ni lem."
15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.","Kepha hin, “Kut ka ni naw leiin taksaa ṭhang ka ni nawh,” ti sienla, chu lei chun taksaa ṭhang naw a ni chuong nawh."
16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.","Chun, nakâwr hin, “Mit ka ni naw leiin taksaa ṭhang ka ni nawh” ti sienla, chu lei chun taksaa ṭhang naw a ni chuong nawh."
17,"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?","Taksa pumpui hi mit ni vawng ta sienla, ri hrietna chu khâwlai am ni tâng a ti leh? A pumin ri hrietna ni vawng ta sienla, rim hriet theina chu khâwlai am ni tâng a ti leh?"
18,"But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin pêng tin hi taksaah a nuomna poah ân umtir seng tah a nih."
19,"And if they were all one member, where were the body?","Chuongchun, chuong po po chu pêng khat chau ni sienla, taksa hi khâwlai am um a ta?"
20,"But now they are many members, but one body.","Amiruokchu, pêng tamtak an ni lem a; nisienlakhawm, taksa pum- khat chau a ni sih a."
21,"And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.","Chun, mit hin kut kuomah, “Ienga khawm hmangna ka nei naw che,” a ti thei nawh; lu khawm hin kephahai kuomah, “Ienga khawm hmangna ka nei naw cheu,” a ti thei bawk nawh."
22,"Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:","Anih, chuong nêk hmanin taksa pêng hrât âwm loa inlanghai hi an pawimaw lem bêk bêk a nih;"
23,"and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness;","chuongchun, taksa pêng chawi- mawi tlâk naw lema ei ruothai hi, chuong ngei chu ei chawimawi nasa lem hlak; chuongchun, ei pêng mawinawhai hin mawina nasa lem an hmu hlak;"
24,"whereas our comely parts have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked;","ei pêng mawi lemhai ruok chun chuong anga thaw chu an ngai nawh; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin mawina neinaw pêng chu chawimawi nasa lemin taksa hi a rem khâwm a nih;"
25,that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.,"taksaa hin inṭhena hrim um loa, pênghai hin inangtaka an inbuoipui tuo seng theina dingin."
26,"And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.","Chuongchun, pêng khatin a tuor chun, pêng po poin an tuorpui hlak, pêng khat chawimawia a um chun, pêng po poin an lâwmpui hlak."
27,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.","Chuongchun, nangnirawi hi Krista taksa chu in nih, a pênghai in ni seng bawk a."
28,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues.","Chun, Pathienin ṭhenkhat chu kohran lai a sieh a, pakhatnaa chun tirkohai, a pahninaa chun thuhriltu- hai, a pathumnaa chun inchûktir- tuhai a sie a, chu hnunga chun thilmak thawhai an um a, chu zoa chun sukdam theina thilpêkhai, ṭhangpui theina thilpêkhai, rorêl thiemna thilpêkhai, ṭawng hrietlo chi tum tuma thuhril theina thilpêkhai a um nâwk a."
29,Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?,An rêngin tirko an ni vawng am a nih? An rêngin thuhriltu an ni vawng am a nih? An rêngin inchûktirtu an ni vawng am a nih? An rêngin thilmak thawtu an ni vawng am a nih?
30,have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?,An rêngin sukdam theina thilpêk chu an nei vawng am a nih? An rêngin ṭawng hrietlohaiin an hril vawng am a nih? An rêngin thu an hrilfie vawng am a nih?
31,But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.,"Thilpêka ropuitakhai chu châk hle lem ro. Chun, tuhin kawng ṭha nâwk zuol inentir ka ti cheu."
