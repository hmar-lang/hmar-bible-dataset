verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?",Nangni laia tûkhawmin mi dang chungah thubuoi nei unla mi inthienghai hmaa tlun loin mi felnawhai hmaah in tlun ngam ding am a nih?
2,"Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?","Anleh, mi inthienghai chun khawvêl hi an ngaituo ding a nih ti in hriet naw am a nih? Chun, khawvêl hman hi in ngaituoa um ding a ni chun, thil chîntakhai khawm chu ngaituo tlâklo in ni ding am a nih?"
3,"Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?","Tulai dam sûng khawsak thu chu hrillo, vântirkohai chen khawm ei ngaituo ding a nih ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
4,"If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?","Chuongchun, tulai dam sûng khawsak thuhai ngaituo ding in neiin kohran laia mi hmusitumhai chu in inngaituotir hlak am a nih?"
5,"I say this to move you to shame. What, cannot there be found among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,","In inzakna dingin ka hril a nih. A unau kâra thu sukthlu thei, mi var pakhat bêk nangni lai in hmu thei naw nîng a ti maw!"
6,"but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?",Unauin a unau rorêlnaa ân tlun hlak hi? Awilohai hmaah a ni nâwk nghâl sih a.
7,"Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?","Anih, hi hi in fel zo zânnawna pakhat chu a ni pang el, thubuoi in nei intuo hlak hi. Iengdinga in- diknawtaka thawna chu in tuor lem el naw am a na? Iengdinga suk- dâwngna chu in tuor el naw?"
8,"Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.","Anih, nangni ngei khawmin in unauhai chungah in sukdik nawh a, in sukdâwng hlak."
9,"Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,","Anleh, mi felnawhai chun Pathien ram hluo naw ni hai ti in hriet naw am a nih? Hlêmin um naw ro; indithmanghai amanih, milim betuhai amanih, uirehai amanih, mihurhai amanih, mawngkawhurhai amanih,"
10,"nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.","inruhmanghai amanih, mi du- âmhai amanih, zu inruihmanghai amanih, inhalhmanghai amanih, hlêpruhaiin amanih Pathien ram hluo naw ni hai."
11,"And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.","Chun, nangni ṭhenkhat chuong ang mi in ni hlak kha; nisienla- khawm, Lalpa Isu Krista hminga le ei Pathien Thlaraua sâwpfai in ni tah a, sukthieng in ni tah a, thiemchang in ni tah."
12,All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.,"Thil iengkim thaw ka ta dingin a thieng a; nisienlakhawm, thil iengkim thaw a ṭha kher nawh; thil iengkim thaw ka ta dingin a thieng a; nisienlakhawm, ieng thu hnuoia um khawm kân phal nawh."
13,"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:","Fâk dinghai chu phîng ta ding a na, phîng chu fâk dinghai ta ding a nih; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin sukbo ve vêng a tih. Chun, taksa hi inditna ding a ni nawh a, Lalpa ta ding a ni lem: Lalpa khawm chu taksa ta ding a nih."
14,"and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power.","Pathienin Lalpa chu a keitho a, eini khawm a thilthawtheinain mi keitho vêng a tih."
15,"Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.",In taksahai chu Krista pênghai a nih ti in hriet naw am a nih? Krista pênghai chu lâkpêkin nawchizawr pênghaiah ka siem ding am a nih? Teu lo e!
16,"Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.","Anleh, nawchizawr zawmpui chu ama leh pumkhat an nih ti in hriet naw am a nih? “An pahniin tisa pumkhat hung ni tâng an tih” ti ziek a ni sih a."
17,But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.,Lalpa inzawmpui ruok chu ama leh Thlarau pumkhat an nih.
18,Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.,Indit hi tlânsan ro. Mihriem isuksuol tinrêng hi taksa puotiengah a nih; mi dithmang ruok chun ama taksa chungah a suksuol a nih.
19,"Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;","Anleh, in taksa chu in sûnga um Pathien kuoma inthawka in hmu Thlarau Inthieng in a ni ti in hriet naw am a nih? Mâni ta khawm in ni nawh a,"
20,for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.,"mana inchâwk in ni tah in sawnnaw; chuleiin, in taksaa chun Pathien chawimawi ro."
