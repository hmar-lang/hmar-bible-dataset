verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.","Hmangaina hi hnawt pei unla, Thlarau tieng thilpêk chu châk hle ro; amiruokchu, thu in hril theina ding lem chun châk bîk ro."
2,"For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.","Ṭawng hrietloa thuhril chun mihriem kâwla hril ni loin, Pathien kuomah a hril lem a ni sih a; tûkhawmin a thuhril chu an hriet si nawh a; nisienlakhawm, thlarau chun thurûk a hril a nih."
3,"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.","Thuhriltu ruok chun mihriem kuomah siem ṭhatna thu dâm, infui- na thu dâm, thlamuongna thu dâm a hril lem hlak."
4,He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.,Ṭawng hrietloa thu hril chun ama chau ân siem ṭha hlak. Thuhriltu ruok chun kohran a siem ṭha hlak.
5,"Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.","Chun, in rênga ṭawng hrietlohaia thu in hril ka nuompêk cheu; nisien- lakhawm, thu in hril ka nuompêk nâwk zuol cheu a nih; kohranin insiemṭhatna an hmu theina dingin a hrilfie nâwk nghâl naw chun, thu hriltu chu ṭawng hrietloa thu hriltu nêk chun a ropui lem hrim hrim a nih."
6,"But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?","Tuhin, unauhai, ṭawng hriet- lohaia thu hrilin in kuomah hung ta ang lang, inhriettirna tieng amanih, hrietna tieng amanih, thu hrilna tieng amanih, inchûktirna tieng ama- nih in kuomah ka hril si naw chun ieng am ka sukṭhathnemna ding cheu a um a?"
7,"Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?","Thil hringna neilo, inri theihai khawm theihle amanih, ṭingṭang amanih, a mumal neia ân ri naw chun, ieng hla inzuiin am an keia ti iengtin am inhriet thei a ti leh?"
8,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?",Tawtawrâwt hi mumal nei loa ân ri chun tu am râl kâp dingin inbuotsai an ta?
9,"So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.","Chuong ang bawkin nangni khawm lei hin ṭawng hriet awla in hril naw chun ieng ang thu am in hril a, ti iengtin am inhriet thei a ta? Boruoka ṭawng mei mei nîng in tih in sawnnaw."
10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without signification.","Khawvêla hin ṭawng ri chi tum tamtak a um a ni thei a; nisien- lakhawm, umzie nei naw hrim hrim a um si nawh a."
11,"If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.","A ṭawng ri umzie ruok chu ka hriet naw chun, kei chu a hriltu ta ding chun ram dang mi nîng ka ta; a hriltu khawm chu ka ta dingin ram dang mi ni bawk a tih."
12,"So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.","Chuongchun, nangni khawmin, thlarau thilpêk chungah ṭhahnem in ngai leiin kohran siemṭhat theina dinga in hausak theina dingin zawng ro."
13,Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.,"Chuleiin, ṭawng hrietloa thu hril chun, a hrilfie theina dingin ṭawngṭai raw se."
14,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.","Ṭawng hrietloa ka ṭawngṭai chun ka thlarau chun chu a ṭawngṭai ngei a, ka hrietna ruok chu a hlâwk chuong nawh."
15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.","Iengtin am ni tâng a ti leh? Thlarauin, ṭawngṭai ka ta, hrietthei- na khawmin ṭawngṭai bawk ka tih; thlarauin hla sak ka ta, hriettheina khawmin sak bawk ka tih."
16,"Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?","Chuong naw chun, thlarauin malsâwmpêk la khawm, a hrenawhai umnaa um chun i lâwmthu hrila chun iengtin am “Amen” ti thei a ta, i thu hril chu hre thei naw sain?"
17,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.","Nang chun chu lâwmthu i hril ṭha takzet a, mi dang ruok chu a siemṭha chuong si nawh."
18,"I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:","Nangni po po nêka ṭawng hrietloa thu ka hril rawn lem leiin, Pathien kuomah lawmthu ka hril a;"
19,"howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.","nisienlakhawm, kohran in- khâwmnaa chun, ṭawng hrietloa thu sîng khat hril nêk chun, mi danghai kân chûktir theina dingin ka hriettheinaa thu panga chau hril ka nuom lem."
20,"Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.","Unauhai, lungril tieng naupang naw ro; nisienlakhawm, suol kawnga chu nautê ang ni unla, lungril tienga chun puitling ro."
21,"In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.","Dân Lekhabua chun, “ ‘ṭawng dang mihai bau le, ram dang mihai hmûrin, hieng mihai kuoma hin thu hril ka ta; chuong sa khawm chun mi ngainaw ni hai,’ Lalpain a tih,” ti ziek a nih."
22,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.","Chuleiin, ṭawng hrietlohai hi awihai ta ding chun inchikna a ni nawh a, awinawhai ta ding a ni lem; thu hril ruok hi chu, awinawhai ta dingin inchikna a ni nawh a, awihai ta dingin a ni lem."
23,"If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?","Chuleiin, kohran po po in- khâwm unla, in rênga ṭawng hriet- lohaia thu in hril chun a la hrenawhai amanih, awinawhai amani hung lût hai sienla, invêt an ti naw ding cheu am a nih?"
24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;","In rêngin thu inhril ruok chun, awinaw amanih, la hrelo amanih hung lût sien la, a thiemnawzie in rênga suklang ni tâng a tih; in rênga suosal ni tâng a tih;"
25,"the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.","a lungril thurûk chu phawr nîng a ta, chuongchun, bawkkhupin Pathien chibai bûk a ta, Pathien nangni lai a um takzet ti hril a tih."
26,"What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.","Unauhai, iengtin am ni tâng a ta? In hung inkhâwmin inpâkna hla amanih, thu inchûktirna amanih, inhriettirna amanih, ṭawng hrietlo amanih, hrilfiena amanih in nei seng hlak. Iengkim siem ṭhatna dingin thaw ni raw se."
27,"If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret:","Tukhawmin ṭawng hrietloa thu an hril chun, pahniin amanih, a tam- takah pathumin amanih ni sienla, insâwk peiin ni bawk raw se; chun, mi pakhatin hrilfie raw se."
28,"but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.","Hrilfietu an um naw chun, kohran inkhâwmnaa chun to zingin um hai sienla, mâni le Pathien kuomah hril raw se."
29,"And let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others discern.","Thuhriltuhai khawmin, pahniin amanih, pathumin amanih, hril sienla, mi danghai chun nguntakin ngaituo raw hai se."
30,"But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.","Amiruokchu, a kâwla ṭhung mi dang kuomah inhriettirna thu pêkin a hung um chun, a hmasa chu to el raw se."
31,"For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;","Mi po poin an inchûk theina ding le, mi po po lungmuonga an um theina dingin pakhat peiin thu in hril thei sih a."
32,and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;,Thuhriltuhai thlarauhai chu thuhriltuhai thununin an um a nih.
33,"for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,","Pathien chu buoina Pathien a ni nawh a, inremna Pathien a ni lem sih a. Mi inthieng kohranhai po poa ang hin,"
34,"let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.",kohran inkhâwmnahaia chun nuhmeihai chu to zingin um raw hai se; anni chu an thu hril phal a ni si nawh a; Dân Lekhabuin a hril ang bawk khan thu zâwmin um lem raw hai se.
35,"And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.","Chun, iengkhawm inchûk an nuom chun, in tieng an pasalhai in- dawn raw hai se; kohran inkhâwm- naa nuhmei thu hril inzak a um sih a."
36,What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?,"Pathien thu hi nangnia inthawk- a suok a ni maw? Annawleh, nangni kuom chaua hung tlung a ni maw?"
37,"If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.","Tûkhawm thu hriltu amanih, thlarau mi amanih nia ân ngai chun in kuoma thu ka ziek hi Lalpa thupêk a ni ti lo hre raw se."
38,"But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.","Nisienlakhawm, tûkhawmin hi hi a hriet nuom naw chun ama chu hriet loin um raw se."
39,"Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.","Chuleiin, ka unauhai, thu hril hi inhâwk hle unla, ṭawng hrietlohaia thu hril khawm khap naw ro;"
40,But let all things be done decently and in order.,"nisienlakhawm, iengkim mawi- tak le feltaka thaw ni raw se."
