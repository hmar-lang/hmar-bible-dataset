1,"Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,","Paula, Pathien ditzâwnga Isu Krista tirko dinga ko le unaupa Sosthen chun:"
2,"unto the church of God which is at Corinth, even them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours:","Korintha Pathien kohran umhai, Krista Isua sukthieng, mi inthieng ni dinga kohai kuomah, ram tina ei Lalpa (anni le eini Lalpa) Isu Krista hming lamtuhai po po kuoma leh."
3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawkin lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
4,"I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;",Krista Isua Pathien lunginsietna in kuoma pêka um lei khan in chungthuah Pathien kuomah lâwm- thu ka hril rawp hlak a nih.
5,"that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;","Iengkimah, thu hril tinrêng le hrietna tinrêngah amaa chun suk- hausaa in um thua khan;"
6,even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:,"chuongchun, Krista thu inhriet- tira um kha nangnia sukdetin a um kha;"
7,so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;,"chuongchun, ei Lalpa Isu Krista inlârna nghâkin thilpêk hrim hrimah in hlawtling naw nawh a."
8,"who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye be unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",Ama chun ei Lalpa Isu Krista niah sawisêlboa in um theina dingin a tâwp chenin sukdet bawk a ti cheu.
9,"God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",Pathien a Naupa ei Lalpa Isu Krista pâwlnaa ko lûttu cheu kha ring a um a nih.
10,"Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.","Chun, unauhai, in rênga thu hmunkhat in hril a, nangni lai inṭhena hrim a um nawna dingin, lungril hmunkhat le ngaituo hmunkhata feltaka in inzawm tlat lemna dingin ei Lalpa Isu Krista hmingin ka ngên cheu."
11,"For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them that are of the household of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.","Ka unauhai, in chungchâng thu chu, nangni lai insêlnahai a um ti Kloi sûnghai chun an mi hril a nih."
12,"Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.","Hi hi a nih ka ti chu: Mi tinin, “Kei Paula pâwl ka nih,” “Kei Appolo pâwl ka nih,” “Kei chu Kipha pâwl ka nih,” “Kei chu Krista pâwl ka nih,” in ti tâwl hi."
13,Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?,"Krista chu ṭhein a um am a nih? Paula in aia hemdein a um am a nih? Annawleh, Paula hminga baptis- in in um am a nih?"
14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;","Krispa le Gaia naw chu nangni lai tûkhawm ka baptis naw leiin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu ka hril hlak a nih,"
15,lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.,"chuong naw chun, keima hminga baptis in nih ti hril rawi an tih."
16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.","Stephan sûnghai ruok chu ka baptis bawk a, chuonghai naw chu mi dang ka baptis am ka hriet nawh."
17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.","Krista chun baptis dingin a mi tir si nawh, Chanchin Ṭha chu hril dingin a mi tir lem a nih; thu vara hril loin; chuong naw chun, Krista kraws chu iengkhawm ni loin inchangtir rawi an tih."
18,For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.,"Kraws thu chu bohmang zinghai ta ding chun invêtna a ni sih a, eini sandam zinghai ta ding ruok chun Pathien thilthawtheina a ni lem."
19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.","“Mi var varna chu sukbohmang ka ta, Remhre remhrietna chu peithlâng ka tih,” ti ziek a ni sih a."
20,Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?,Mi var chu khâwlai am a um a? Dân hre mi khawm chu khâwlai am a um a? Hi khawvêla sêltu chu khâwlai am a um a? Pathienin khawvêl varna hi invêtthlâk a nih ti ân hriettir naw am a nih?
21,"For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.",Pathien varnaa chun khawvêlin varna hmanga Pathien an hmu thei naw hnungin thu hril invêt hmanga a ringtuhai sandam chu Pathienin ṭha a ti hle sih a.
22,"Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:","Judahai chun inchikna an phût hlak, Grik mihai khawma varna an zawng bawk hlak;"
23,"but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;","keini ruok chun Krista hemdea um thu chu kan hril lem hlak a ni hi; chu chu Judahai ta dingin tlûkna, Jentailhai ta dingin invêtna a nih."
24,"but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.","Amiruokchu, Judahai khawm ni sienla, Grikhai khawm ni sienla, kohai ta ding chun Krista Pathien thilthawtheina le Pathien varna chu a nih."
25,Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.,"Pathien invêtna chu mihriem varna nêkin a var lem a, Pathien hrâtnawna khawm mihriem hrâtna nêkin a hrât lem sih a."
26,"For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:","Unauhai, a kona cheu hi ngaituo ta u, tisa tienga mi var tamtakhai, mi hrât tamtakhai, mi ṭha tamtakhai ko an ni naw zie hi;"
27,"but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;","nisienlakhawm, Pathienin khawvêl thil invêthai chu a thlang lem a, mi varhai chu a sukmuolpho theina dingin;"
28,"and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, yea and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:","chun, khawvêl thil sie le hmusitumhai, thil umnawhai chenin a thlang a, thil umsahai chu ieng- khawm ni loa a siem theina dingin;"
29,that no flesh should glory before God.,"chuongchun, Pathien hmaah mi tûkhawm insuong thei naw ni hai."
30,"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:","Nangni ruok chu ama zârah, Krista Isua chun in um a nih; ama chu Pathien kuoma inthawka ei ta dinga varnaa siem a nih, felnaa dâm, inthiengnaa dâm, intlannaa dâm leh."
31,"that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.","Chuongchun, an ziek ang khan, “A suong taphawt chun Lalpa chu suong raw seh.”"
