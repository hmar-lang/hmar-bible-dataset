1,"It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one of you hath his father’s wife.","Nangni lai indit a um ti ân thang veng vung a nih, chuong ang indit chu Jentailhai lai hmana um ngai lo, nangni laia mi pakhatin mâni pa nuhmei a nei kha."
2,"And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.","Chun, chuong thil thawtu chu nangni laia inthawka hnawtdawk dinga lungngai nêk hmanin in uong lem sih a."
3,"For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,","Keima ngei hi taksain ka ṭhang naw nâk a, thlaraua ruok chu ka ṭhang a, chuong ang thil chuong ang lâwm lâwm thawtu chu tu khawm hin Lalpa Isu Krista hmingin nangni laia ṭhang zing angin ka lo ngaituo zo tah:"
4,"in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,",nangni le ka thlarau chu ei Lalpa Isu thilthawtheinaa inkhâwmin;
5,"to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",mi chuong ang chu a thlarau Lalpa nia chun sandamin a um theina dingin a tisa chu sukbohmang dingin Setan pe inla ka ti a nih.
6,Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?,"In uong san hi a ṭha nawh ie, chawl tlâwmtêin bei tlang chu a zawpsuo vawng hlak ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
7,"Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ:","Chawlṭhanglo in ni ang bawkin bei tlang thar in ni theina dingin chawl hlui chu zenfai ro. Ei Fekân Ruoiṭhena ding khawm an that ta sih a, Krista ngei chu;"
8,"wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.","chuleiin, ruoi ṭhêng ei tiu, chawl hluia ṭhe loin, nunsiet le suolna chawla ṭhe bawk loin, takna le indikna chawlṭhanglo beiin ruoi ṭhe lem ei tiu."
9,I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;,Ka lekhathawna khan indit hmanghai pâwl lo dingin in kuomah ka ziek kha;
10,"not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:","hi khawvêla indit hmanghai amanih, duâm le hlêpruhai amanih, milim betuhai amani chu pâwl dêr lo ding ti ka ni nawh a, chuongchu ni sien la khawvêla inthawka fe suok ngei ding in ni ding a ni sih a."
11,"but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.","Tu ruok hin chu tûkhawm unau hming input siin indit hmang mi amanih, mi duâm amanih, milim betu amanih, inhalhmang amanih, zu inruihmang mi amanih, hlêpru mi amani ni sienla, pâwl lo dingin in kuomah ka ziek a nih; chuong ang mi kuoma chun a fâk khawm fa lo dingin."
12,For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?,Puotienga mi chu keiin ka ngaituona ding iengam a um a?
13,But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.,Nangniin sûngtienga mi in ngaituoin puotienga mihai ruok chu Pathienin a ngaituo hlak a ni naw am a nih? chu mi suol chu nangni laia inthawkin hnawt dawk ro.
