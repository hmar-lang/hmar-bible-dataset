11,"let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.","Chuleiin, tûkhawmin hmusit naw raw se; ka kuoma a hung theina dingin thlamuongtakin inthla lem ro, unauhai ruolin ama lo hmu ka beisei sih a."
12,"But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not at all his will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.","Ei unau Appolo thu kha chu, unauhai ruola in kuoma hung dingin ka ngên rak a, ana chu, tuta ṭum chu hung a nuom naw tawp el; a remchâng pha ruok chu hung a tih."

15,"Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),","Unauhai, ka ngên cheu a nih: Stephan sûnghai chu Akaia rama awihai hmaṭhuoitu an na, mi inthienghai rawng bâwl dingin an inpêk ti in hriet a,"
16,"that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.",chuong ang mihai kuoma le sinthawa ṭhangpui le sin inrim taphawt kuoma chun intuklût dingin.

20,All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.,Unau po po hin chibai an bûk cheu. Infâwp inthiengin chibai inbûk seng ro.
