1,"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.","Chun, milimhai kuoma inthâwina thilhai thu kha chu: Ei rêngin hrietna ei nei seng ti ei inhriet a. Hrietna hin chu mi a sukuong hlak a, lunginsietna ruok chun mi a siem ṭha hlak."
2,"If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;","Tûkhawmin thil ieng amani hrea ân ngai chun, a hriet ding ang chu a la hriet nawh a;"
3,"but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.","amiruokchu, mi tûkhawmin Pathien a hmangai chun, chu ngei chu ama ihriet a nih."
4,"Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one.","Chuongchun, milimhai kuoma inthawina thil fâk kawnga chu, khawvêla hin milim hrim hrim chu iengkhawm an ni nawzie le, pakhat chau naw chu Pathien dang hrim an um naw chu ei hriet a."
5,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;","Vâna manih, hnuoia manih pathien hmingput um hai sien- khawm, (chuong ang pathien tamtak le lalpa tamtak an um sih a,)"
6,"yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.","Eini ta ding chun Pathien pakhat chau (Pa chu) a um a, ama kuoma inthawkin tinrêng a suok a, eini khawm ama ta dinga um ei nih; Lalpa pakhat chau (Isu Krista chu) a um bawk a, ama leiin iengkim a um a, eini khawm ama lei bawka um ei nih."
7,"Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.","Amiruokchu, chu hrietna chu mi po po kuomah a um nawh, chuongchun, mi ṭhenkhatin tu chen hin milim be ṭhang an ni leiin, milim kuoma inthâwina thil angtaka ngaiin an fâk hlak; chuongchun, an sie le ṭha hrietna chu a hrât naw leiin a hung inthiengnaw hlak."
8,"But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.","Nisienlakhawm, fâk ding hin Pathien mit mîn tlungtir chuong naw ni; fa naw inla khawm se chuong naw bawk ei tih; fa inla khawm ṭha chuong naw bawk ei tih."
9,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.,"Nisienlakhawm, fîmkhur ro, chuong naw chun, nuom nuoma in tlat theina hi mi hrâtnawhai ta dingin tlûkna ni rawi a tih."
10,"For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?","Nang hrietna nei mi, tûkhawm- in milim biekna ina thlaithlêng awta an hmu si che chun, anni chu mi hrâtnaw lo ni hai sienla an sie le ṭha hrietna chun milim kuoma inthâwina thil fâk a hung ngam ding a ni naw am a nih?"
11,"For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.","Chuongchun, i hrietna lei chun mi hrâtnaw (unau a thi ai Kristain a thipêk) chu suksietin um a tih."
12,"And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.","Unauhai chungah chuong ang thil in suksuola, an sie le ṭha hrietna a hrât naw nâklai, in inhliem hlau chun, Krista chungah thil in suksuol a nih."
13,"Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.","Chuleiin, fâk dingin ka unau a sukthlûk chun, ka unau ka sukthlûk nawna dingin kumkhuoin sa hrim hrim fa ta naw ning."
