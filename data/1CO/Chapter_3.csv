verse_no,en,hmr
1,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.","Chun, unauhai, Thlarau mi kuoma hril angin in kuomah thu ka hril thei nawh a, tisa mihai kuoma hril angin ka hril lem kha; Kristaa nautêhai kuoma hril ang elin."
2,"I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nay, not even now are ye able;","Bu ni loin, nênetuiin ka châwm cheu kha, bu in la fâk thei naw leiin; anih, tu khawm hin in la fâk thei naw rawp a nih, tisa mi in la ni rawp leiin."
3,"for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?",Nangni laia inthîkna le insêlna a um hlak leiin tisa mi la niin mihriem angin in la um zing a ni naw am a nih?
4,"For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?","Mi pakhatin, “Paula pâwl ka nih,” mi dangin, “kei chu Appolo pâwl ka nih,” in ti sûng chu mihriem in ni zing a ni naw am a ni?"
5,What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.,Appolo chu ieng am a ni leh? Paula khawm chu ieng am a na? Rawngbâwltu nangni inawitirtu cheu chau an nih in sawnnaw; chu khawm chu Lalpain a ipêk ang ve ve chau a nih.
6,"I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.","Keiin ka phun a, Appoloin tuiin a châwm a, nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ân ṭhangtir a nih."
7,"So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.","Chuongchun, ân ṭhangtirtu Pathien chau naw chu a phuntu chu iengkhawm a ni nawh a, tuia châwm- tu khawm chu iengkhawm a ni nawh."
8,Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.,"Chun, a phuntu le tuia châwmtu pumkhat an nih, nisienlakhawm, mâni sinthaw ang peiin lâwmman hmu ve vêng an tih."
9,"For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.","Keini chu Pathien sinthaw- puituhai kan ni sih a, nangni Pathien lohma chu in na, Pathien in bâwl chu in ni bawk a nih."
10,"According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.","Pathien lunginsietna ka kuoma pêka um ang peiin in bâwl hotu tak vartak angin keiin lungphûm ka rem a, mi dangin a chungah in an bâwl a, nisienlakhawm, mi tin a chunga bawl dingziea chun fimkhur seng raw hai se."
11,"For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.","Lungphûm rem tasa naw chu tûkhawma lungphûm dang an rem thei si naw a, chu lungphûm chu Isu Krista chu a nih."
12,"But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;","Chun, lungphûm chunga chun tûkhawmin rângkachakin amanih, tangkain amanih, lungmantamin amanih, thingin amanih, sâwlhnain amanih, bupâwlin amanih bâwl sienla, mi tin sinthaw chu inlang a tih;"
13,"each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.","ni chun a suklang ding a ni sih a, meiin ân lâr ding a ni leiin, mei ngei chun mi tin sinthaw chu ieng ang am a ni fie tâng a tih."
14,"If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.","Tû sinthaw khawm a chunga a bâwl chu a um zing chun, ama chun lâwmman hmûng a tih."
15,"If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.","Tû sinthaw khawm a kâng chun, ama chun chân a tih, ama tak ruok chu sandamin um a tih, nisienlakhawm, meia fe thleng ang elin."
16,"Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?",Pathien in in ni le Pathien Thlarau nangniah a um ti in hriet naw am a nih?
17,"If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.","Tûkhawmin Pathien in chu a sukkhawhlo chun Pathienin ama chu sukkhawhlo vêng a tih, Pathien in chu ân thieng sih a, chu in chu nangni in nih."
18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.",Tûkhawmin ama le ama inhlêm naw raw se. Nangni laia tûkhawm hi khawvêla vara inngai chu a hung var theina dingin mi invêtah hung inchang phawt raw se.
19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:","Hi khawvêl varna hi Pathien ngaiah invêtna a ni sih a. “Ama chun mi varhai chu anni var vervêknaah a âwk hlak,” ti ziek a ni sih a."
20,"and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.","“Lalpa chun mi varhai ngai- tuona chu a thlâwn a nih ti a hriet,” ti ziek a ni nâwk bawk a."
21,Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;,"Chuleiin, tûkhawmin mihriem- hai suong naw raw se."
22,"whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;","Iengkim hi in ta vawng a ni sih a: Paula amanih, Appolo amanih, Ki- pha amanih, khawvêl amanih, hring- na amanih, thina amanih, thil um tasahai amanih, a hung um dinghai le chun a rêngin in ta vawng a nih."
23,and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.,"Nangni khawm Krista ta in na, Krista khawm chu Pathien ta a nih."
