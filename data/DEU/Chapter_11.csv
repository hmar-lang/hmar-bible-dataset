1,"Therefore thou shalt love Jehovah thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, alway.","“Chuleiin, LALPA in Pathien chu in hmangaiin a thuruot- hai, a dânhai, a rorêlhai, a thupêk- hai chu in zâwm rawp ding a nih."
2,"And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,","Tuhin lo hre unla, LALPA in Pathien thununna dâm, a ropuizie dâm, a bân hrâtzie dâm, a bân pharzie dâm,"
3,"and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;","a inchikna dâm, a thilthaw Aigupta ram sûnga Aigupta lal Pharao chung le a ram sûng po poa a thaw dâm kha."
4,"and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah hath destroyed them unto this day;","Aigupta sipaihai le an sakawrhai le an tawlailîr chunga a thilthawhai kha, an hnawt lai cheua Tuisuoriet Sen tuia ân chimtirzie dâm; tu chena LALPAIN a sukbohmangzie dâm,"
5,"and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;","hi hmun in tlung hmakhata thlalêra in chunga a thilthaw dân dâm,"
6,"and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:","Reuben naupa Eliab naupa Dathan le Abiram hai chunga a thaw dân dam; hnuoiin a bâu a ka a, Israel mi po po lai anni le an sûnghai le an puon inhai le an ran ṭhuoi po po a lem vawng dân dâm hre lo in thlahai kuoma hril ka ni nawh a,"
7,but your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which he did.,in mit ngeia LALPAIN thil ropuitak a thaw po po hmutuhai kuomah a ni lem a nih.
8,"Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it;","“Chuleiin, in hung hrât a, in va pan ram chu in hluo theina dingin tuta thu ka pêk cheu, thupêk po po hi in zâwm ding a nih;"
9,"and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.","nênetui le khuoizu luongna ram, in pi le puhai le an thlahai pêk dinga LALPAIN ṭawng a lo inkhâmna tah rama chun in chêng sâwt theina dingin."
10,"For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;","In va hluo ding ram chu in hung suokna Aigupta ram, thlai huona chi in tu a, in kea tui in buokna hlak ang a ni nawh a;"
11,"but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven,",in va hluo ding ram chu tlânghai le ruomhai le vân ruotui dawng ram a ni lem a.
12,"a land which Jehovah thy God careth for: the eyes of Jehovah thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.",LALPA in Pathienin a lungkham ram a nih; LALPA in Pathien mit chu kum thara inthawka a tâwp chenin a fu hlak.
13,"And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,","“Chun, LALPA in Pathien chu hmangai ding le in lungril po po le in lungvar po poa a rawngbâwl dinga ka thupêk tuta ka pêk cheu hi ṭha- hnemngaitaka in zâwm chun,"
14,"that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy grain, and thy new wine, and thine oil.","in ram ruotui chu a huntakah, ruotui tla hmasa le ruotui tla nuhnung chu pêng ka ti cheu a, chuongchun, in bu dâm, in uoin dâm, in hriek dâm sîk khâwm thei in tih."
15,"And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be full.","In ranhai ta dingin in rama hlohna khawm inumtir bawk ka ta, nangni khawma fâng in ta, tlai in tih."
16,"Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;","Fîmkhur ro khai, chuong naw chun, in lungril chu hlêmin um a ta, pêthmang in ta, pathien dang rawng dâm bâwl in ta, be el rawi in tih;"
17,"and the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah giveth you.","chuong a ni chun LALPA lung chu in chungah hung inthawk a ta, vân chu khâr a ta, ruo sûr naw nih a; hnuoi chun a ra insuo naw ni a, chuongchun, LALPA pêk cheu, ram ṭhataka inthawk hi bohmang vak el in tih."
18,"Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.","“Chuleiin, hieng ka thuhai hi in lungril le, in lungvarah khum inta, inchikna dingin in bânah zem in ta, in mit le mit inkârah chalhrênna dingin a um bawk ding a nih."
19,"And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.","Chuong chu in nauhai inchûktir in ta, in ina in ṭhung lai dâmin, lampuia in fe lai dâmin, in zâl lai dâmin, in tho pha khawm in hril hlak ding a nih."
20,"And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;","Chun, in kawtkhâr bienghaiah, in kawtkhâra dâm in ziek ding a nih."
21,"that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.","Chuongchun, in pi le puhai pêk dinga ṭawng ân khâmna rama chun in dam sûng ni le in nauhai dam sûng nihai chu hnuoi chungah vân hai um sûng sâwt ang peiin sukseiin um a tih."
22,"For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;","“LALPA in Pathien chu hmangai ding le, a lampui po po hraw ding le ama chel tlat dinga ṭha- hnemngaitaka hieng thu ka pêk cheu thupêk po po hi in zâwm phawt chun,"
23,"then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.","LALPA chun hieng hnamhai po po hi hnawt suokpêk a ti cheu a, nangni nêka ropui le thilthawthei lem hnam ram chu hluong in tih."
24,"Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.","In kephaa in sirna taphawt chu in ta nîng a tih, thlalêra inthawk le Lebanon tlânga inthawka vadung, Euphrates vadunga inthawk chun thlangtieng tuisuoriet chenin in ram nîng a tih."
25,"There shall no man be able to stand before you: Jehovah your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you.",Tukhawm in hmaah ngîr thei naw ni hai a; LALPA in Pathienin in kuoma a hril ta ang khan in va sir ding ram po poa chun nangni ṭina le ṭiumna inumtir a tih.
26,"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:","Ngai ta u, vawisûn hin in hmaah malsâwmna le ṭawngsie ka sieh a;"
27,"the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day;","LALPA in Pathien thupêkhai tuta ka pêk cheu hi in zâwm chun malsâwmna,"
28,"and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.","LALPA in Pathien thupêkhai chu in zâwm nawh a, in hriet ngai lo pathien danghai be dinga tuta ka thupêk cheu hi in pêtsan chun ṭawngsephurin um in tih."
29,"And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.","“Chun, in va hluo ding rama LALPA in Pathienin a ṭhuoi lût pha cheu chun, malsâwmna chu Gerizim tlângah sieng in ta, ṭawngsie chu Ebal tlângah."
30,"Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?","Chu tlânghai chu nisa tlâkna khêl Araba tieng lampuia um, Kanaan mihai ram, Gilgal zâwn, More thingsaisuo sîr, Jordan râla um an nih."
31,"For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.","LALPA in Pathienin a pêk cheu ram va hluo ding chun Jordan chu in kân ding a na, hluong in ta, chutaka chun um in tih."
32,And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.,"Chun, tuta in hmaa ka sie, thuruot le rorêl po po hi zâwm dingin in fîmkhur ding a nih."
