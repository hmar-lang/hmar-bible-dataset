1,"Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Jehovah spake unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days.","“Chun, ei insawn a, LALPAIN ka kuoma a hril angin Tuisuoriet Sen tieng Thlalêrah ei lût tah a; Seir tlâng chu sâwt rei ei vêl a."
2,"And Jehovah spake unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA chun a mi biek a, ka kuomah,"
3,Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.,"‘Hi tlâng hi in vêl sâwt tâwk tah a, hmartieng panin insawn ta ro."
4,"And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore;","Mipuihai chu Seir tlânga um Esau thla in unauhai ramah in fe thleng ding a nih. Anni chun lo ṭing an ti cheu; chuleiin, fimkhur hle ro."
5,"contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.",Anni chu thaw naw ro. An ram chu a khâwlai khawm kephaa sir khawp chau khawm ka pêk naw ding cheu a nih; Seir tlâng chu ama chanpuol dingin Esau ka pêk tah a nih.
6,"Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.",An buhai chu in fâk dingin sumin inchâwng in ta; an tuihai chu in dâwn dingin sumin in inchâwk bawk ding a nih.
7,For Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Jehovah thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.,"LALPA in Pathien chun in thaw taphawthaia chun mal a sâwm hlak cheu a, hi thlalêr lientak hi in fe thleng dân dâm chu a hriet sih a; hieng kum sâwmli sûng po hin LALPA chu in kuomah a um a, ieng- khawm in tlasam naw kha, tiin thu pe rawh,’ tiin."
8,"So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.","Chuongchun, Elath le Ezion- gebera inthawkin Araba lampuia fein, Seir tlânga um Esau thla ei unauhai ram ei fe thleng a. Chun, ei insawn a, Moab thlalêr tieng ei feh a."
9,"And Jehovah said unto me, Vex not Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.","Chun, LALPAIN ka kuoma, ‘Moab mihai chu sukbuoi naw unla, râl thawin thaw naw ro; an ram chu in puola dingin ka pêk naw ding cheu a nih, Lota thlahai puolah Ar chu ka pêk tah a nih."
10,"(The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:",(Kha hma khan chu Anak mihai anga mi lien le tam le mi insângtak tak Em mihai an um hlak a;
11,"these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.","chuonghai khawm chu Anak mihai ang bawka Repha mihai ti an na; nisienlakhawm, Moab mihai chun Em mihai an ti hlak a nih."
12,"The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which Jehovah gave unto them).","Kha hma khan chu Seir tlânga hin Hor mihai khawm an um bawk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, Esau thlahai hin an hluopêk a, an that a, an hmuna chun an um tah a; Israelhaiin LALPAIN an puola ram a pêk chunga an thaw ang khan)."
13,"Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.","Chuongchun, Tho unla, Zered vadung chu kân ro khai,’ a ta. Chuongchun, Zered vadung chu ei kân tah a."
14,"And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware unto them.","Kades-barneaa inthawka ei suok le Zered vadung ei kân a, LALPAIN an kuoma ân khâm anga mipuihai laia chu suona râlkâp mi po po an bohmang vawng inkâr chu kum sâwmthum pariet a nih."
15,"Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.",Mipuihai laia inthawka an bohmang dêr hmakhat chun anni chu sukbohmang dingin LALPA kutin a tai zing bawk a.
16,"So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,","“Chuong anga mipuihai laia inthawka râlkâp mi po po an bo- hmang vawng a, an hung thi zo hnung chun,"
17,"that Jehovah spake unto me, saying,","LALPAIN a mi biek a,"
18,"Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:",‘Vawisûn hin Moab ram Ar chu i fe thleng ding a na;
19,"and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.","chun, Ammon thlahai ep i va tlung hnai pha khawm sukbuoi naw la, thaw bawk naw rawh; Ammon mihai ram chu i puolah ka pêk naw ding che a nih; Lota thlahai puolah ka pêk tah a nih."
20,"(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,","(Chu khawm chu Repha mihai rama ngai a ni bawk; chutaka chun kha hma khan Repha mihai chu an um hlak a; nisienlakhawm, Ammon mihai chun Zamzum mihai an ti hlak a nih."
21,"a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Jehovah destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;","Anak mihai anga mi lien le tam le mi insângtak tak an nih; nisien- lakhawm, LALPAIN a sukbohmang- pêk a, an hluo ve ta thung a, an hmuna chun an um tah a;"
22,"as he did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day.","Seir tlânga um Esau thlahai chu Hor mihai a sukbohmang laia a thaw ang khan; chuongchun, an hluo ve ta thung a, an hmuna chun tu chen hin an um tah a;"
23,"And the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)","chun, Gaza chena khaw chîn- haia um Av mihai chu Kaphtora inthawka hung suok Kaphtor mihai vêk chun an sukbohmang a, an hmuna chun an um tah a.)"
24,"Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.","Tho unla, fe suok unla, Arnon ruom kân ro; ngai ta u, Amor mi Hesbon lal Sihon le a ram chu ka pêk ta cheu a nih; hluo phawt unla, râl thawin va thaw ro."
25,"This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.","Vawisûn hin vânkhuphnuoia hnam tin chunga chun nangma ṭina le ṭitumna in um ṭantir ka ta, i chanchin lo hrieng an ta, inthin an ta, nangma leiin lungngaitakin um an tih,’ tiin."
26,"And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,","“Chun, Kedemoth thlalêra in- thawkin Hesbon lal Sihon kuomah inremna thu chawiin mihai ka tir a,"
27,"Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left.","‘I rama hin mîn fe thlengtir raw khai; lamliena pei fêng ka ta, chang- tienga manih, vawitienga mani khawm pêt naw ningah."
28,"Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet;",Ka fâk dingin bu sumin mîn chawktir i ta; ka dâwn dingin tui khawm sumin mîn chawktir i ta; mîn fe thlengtir ringawt el rawh;
29,"as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.","Jordan ka kân a, LALPA kan Pathienin a mi pêk ram lût hmakhata Seira um Esau thlahai le Ar-a um Moab mihai mi thaw ang khan,’ tiin."
30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day.","Nisienlakhawm, Hesbon lal Sihon chun a rama chun a mîn fe thlengtir phal nawh a; LALPA in Pathien chun vawisûna anga in kuta a pêk theina ding cheuin a lungril a sukngarpêk a, a suklulul a nih."
31,"And Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.","Chun, LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Ngai ta, Sihon le a ram chu ka pêk ta ding che a nih, a ram chu nei dingin hluo phawt el rawh,’ a mi tih a."
32,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz.","Chuongchun, Sihon le a mihai po po chu Jahaz-ah a mi thaw dingin an hung inthawk a."
33,"And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.","Chun, LALPA ei Pathien chun a mi pêk a; chuongchun, ama le a naupasalhai le a mihai po po chu ei that a."
34,"And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:","Chu ṭum chun a khuo po po chu ei lâk a, chuong khuoa mihriem po po chu, nuhmei le an nauhai leh ei sukbohmang vawng a, hla hrim hrim ei nei nawh."
35,"only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.",Ei lâk khuoa râllâka ei lâk thil le ranhai chau ei chan dingin ei lâk a nih.
36,"From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us:","Arnon ruom sîra Aroera in- thawk le ruoma khaw uma inthawka Gilead chenin ei ta dingin insâng taluo khuo hrim a um dêr nawh a, LALPA ei Pathien mi pêk vawng a nih."
37,"only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wheresoever Jehovah our God forbade us.","Ammon thlahai ram chau in hnai naw a nih, Jabbok vadung râl khingtieng pang po po le tlâng rama khuohai le LALPA ei Pathienin a mi khapna taphawthai leh."
