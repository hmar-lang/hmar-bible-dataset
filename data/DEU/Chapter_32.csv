1,"Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.","“Na lo sit ro, vânhai ka hril ding a nih; Ka ṭawng bausuok leihnuoi hin lo ngai raw se,"
2,"My doctrine shall drop as the rain; My speech shall distil as the dew, As the small rain upon the tender grass, And as the showers upon the herb.","Ruotui angin ka thu chu sûr a ta, Dâidâw angin ka thu chu far a tih; Hlobet innotak chunga ruo ang le, Hlohna chunga ruomuolkhawi angin."
3,For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah: Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.,"LALPA hming chu ka phuong ding a nih, Ropuina chu ei Pathien pe ro."
4,"The Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are justice: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he.","“Lungpui chu, a thilthaw chu a fel famkim a; A lampui po po chu ân dik a nih. Pathien ringum, rîtlona nei lo, Fel le ṭha a nih."
5,"They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is their blemish; They are a perverse and crooked generation.","Ṭha nawtakin a chungah an thaw a, a nauhai an ni ta nawh an demkaina leiin, Suon bengtlanaw le kâwmaw an nih."
6,"Do ye thus requite Jehovah, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? He hath made thee, and established thee.","Aw mi invêt le var nawhai, Chuong ang chun maw LALPA chu in thung ding chu? Ama chu ân dintu che i pa, Siemtu che le inngîr dettu che ni lo am a nih?"
7,"Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations: Ask thy father, and he will show thee; Thine elders, and they will tell thee.","Kha hma nihai kha hre zing la, Suon tamtak kumhai chu ngaituo ro: I pa indawn la, khîkhmûng a che; I upahai khawm, hril an ti che."
8,"When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel.","A Chunghnungtak chun hnamhai ram a pêk laia, Mihriem nauhai a ṭhe lai khan, Hnamhai ramri chu a khang a, Israel thlahai zât ang peiin."
9,For Jehovah’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.,"LALPA chanvo chu a mihai an na, Jakobrawi chu a rochan an nih."
10,"He found him in a desert land, And in the waste howling wilderness; He compassed him about, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye.","“Thlalêr ram ruok inrûm vung vunga chun; A vêla umnghain a enkawl a, A mitnaulêng angin a kawl a."
11,"As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, That fluttereth over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bare them on his pinions.","Mupuiin a bua a te a chawk- tho a, A te chungah thla a zâp a, A thlahai a zâr a, a lâk a, A thlaa a dawm hlak angin,"
12,"Jehovah alone did lead him, And there was no foreign god with him.","LALPA chauin a ṭhuoi hlak a, Ram dang pathien ni loin."
13,"He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he did eat the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock;","Hnuoi hmun insângahai chun ân chuongtir a, Loa thil rasuok chu a fâk hlak a; Lungpuia inthawka khuoizu ân dâwntir hlak a, Lung changa inthawka hriek leh."
14,"Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.","Bâwng nênetui inkhal, berâm nênetui, Berâmte thâuhai leh, Basan ram berâmchal le kêlhai, Bu inhniktak chihai leh; Grêp tui uoin i dâwn a."
15,"But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek; Then he forsook God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.","“Nisienlakhawm, Jesurun chu a hung hausa a, a hung hel a, A hung thâu a, a hung inchawm a, a hung nâm tah a; A siemtu Pathien a nghatsan a, A sandamna Lungpui chu a ngainêp a."
16,They moved him to jealousy with strange gods; With abominations provoked they him to anger.,"Ram dang pathienhai bein a thîkthu an chawktho a, Thil tirdakumin an chawk lungsen a."
17,"They sacrificed unto demons, which were no God, To gods that they knew not, To new gods that came up of late, Which your fathers dreaded not.","Pathien ni lo, khawhrihai kuomah an inthâwi a, An hriet ngai naw pathienhai kuomah, Vaihnurama um chau pathien tharhai, In pi in puhai iṭi ngai lohai kuoma chun."
18,"Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth.","A thlatu che Lungpui chu i ngaisâng nawh a, A siemtu che Pathien i theinghil bawk."
19,"And Jehovah saw it, and abhorred them, Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.","“Chu chu LALPAIN a hmuh a, a theida a, A naunu le naupasalhai isuklungsenna leiin."
20,"And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: For they are a very perverse generation, Children in whom is no faithfulness.","‘Inbîk hmangsan ka ta, Iengtin am an um hrim hrim,’ a ta. Suon rilo an nih, Ringum lo nauhai."
21,They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.,"Pathien ni lo thilin ka thîkthu an chawktho a, An milimhaiin an mi suklungsen a; Chia hril lohaiin inthîktir ka ta, Hnam invêthaiin suklungsen ka tih."
22,"For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And burneth unto the lowest Sheol, And devoureth the earth with its increase, And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.","Ka lunginsen a chawk a, Seol mawng chenin a kâng a, Leihnuoi, a rasuok pumin a kâng zo, Tlâng innghatna dâm a kâng a."
23,I will heap evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them:,"“An chungah sietna intieng khâwm ka ta, An chungah thal inthlâng ka tih."
24,"They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.","Phîngṭamin inrâwp an ta, meipui le sietna namên loin kâng hmang an tih; An chungah ramsa hahai tir ka ta. Pilvuta invâk mihai tûr leh."
25,"Without shall the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; It shall destroy both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs.","Puotiengah kâwlhnâmin thîng an ta, Sûngtienga chun thlabârin, Nunghâk, tlangvâl, nêne ne lai, Lua kêlsam ṭohai chenin."
26,"I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;","‘Sukdar vawng ka ta, Mihriem laia anni hriet zingna chu sukbohmang dai ka tih,’ lo ti hiel tâng ka tih."
27,"Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should judge amiss, Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Jehovah hath not done all this.","An hmêlmahai chu ngaisuolin, ‘Kan kut chu dawm sângin a um tah, Hieng po po hi LALPA ithaw a ni tawp nawh,’ hmêlma lunginsen chun tîng an tih ti ṭi naw lang chu."
28,"For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them.","Varna bo hnam an na, Annia chun hrietthiemna a um nawh."
29,"Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!","Aw, var hai sien chu hieng hi hrethiem an ta, An hihnung thil ding an ngaituo ding bah."
30,"How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Jehovah had delivered them up?","Iengtin am pakhatin sâng hnawt a ta, Pahniin sîng intlânsiettir an ta, An Lungpuiin anni a zawr a, LALPAIN anni ân hlân a ni si naw chun?"
31,"For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges.","An Lungpui chu ei Lungpui ang a ni nawh a, Ei hmêlmahai ngei ngaidân khawma."
32,"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter:","An grêphrui chu Sodom grêphrui, Gomorra rama mi a nih; An grêphai chu tûr grêp a nih. A bâwrhai chu a khâ."
33,"Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of asps.","An uoinhai chu drakon tûr le, Rûlriel tûr hrâttak a nih."
34,"Is not this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures?","“Chu chu ka ikhâwlkhâwm, Ka robâwma châr khum chie a ni naw am a nih?"
35,"Vengeance is mine, and recompense, At the time when their foot shall slide: For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.","Phuba lâk le thung chu keima thaw ding a nih, An kalbi ân tleu pha chun, An sietna ni chu a hung hnai an tah a, An chunga thil tlung dinghai chu hung tlung vak a tih."
36,"For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself for his servants; When he seeth that their power is gone, And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.","LALPA chun a mihai ro a rêl ding a na, A siehlawhai khawm thawpêk a tih; An thilthawtheina inhmang a, Khuokhir le khir naw tukhawm um dêr loa a hmu pha chun."
37,"And he will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;","Hieng ang hin tîng a tih, ‘Khâwlai am an pathien, An ring lungpui chu,"
38,"Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your protection.","An inthawina thâu fatu, An dâwn ding thilinhlân uoin dâwntuhai chu? Hung thoin hung ṭhangpui sienla cheu, Nangni humtu hung ni raw se."
39,"See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.","“Kei, keima ngei ka ni hre unla, Pathien dang an um nawh; Ka sukhlum hlak a, ka sukhring bawk hlak; Ka sukhliem hlak a, ka sukdam bawk hlak; Ka kuta inthawka mi lapêk thei hrim hrim an um nawh."
40,"For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live for ever,","Vân tieng ka kut ka phar a, Ka hringna sâlin ka hril a,"
41,"If I whet my glittering sword, And my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me.","Ka kâwlhnâm tle ka tâtngei a, Ka kutin rorêlna ka kawl chun, Ka hmêlmahai chungah phuba lâng ka ta; A mi theidatuhai chu thung ka tih."
42,"I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the head of the leaders of the enemy.","Ka thalhai chu thisenin sukrui ka ta, Ka kâwlhnâm chun thisen lem a tih; Thathai le salhai thisen le Hmêlma hotuhai lu chenin,” tiin."
43,"Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: For he will avenge the blood of his servants, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people.","“Aw, nangni hnam tinhai, A siehlawhai thisen phuba chu a lâk ding a nih; Ama dotuhai chungah phuba a lâk ding a nih, A ram le a mihai ta dingin inremna famkim siem a tih,”"
44,"And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.","Mipuihai na hrietah chuong hla thu po po chu Mosien a hril vawng a, ama le Nun naupa Hosea leh."
45,And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;,"Chun, Mosien chuong thu po po chu Israel mi po po kuoma a hril zo chun, an kuomah,"
46,"and he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, even all the words of this law.","“Tuta in kuoma ka thu in- hriettira cheu hin, in lungril innghat tlat unla, hieng dân thuhai po po hi fîmkhurtaka zâwm dingin in nauhai chu thu pe ro."
47,"For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.","In ta dingin thil teplo mei mei a ni nawh a, in hringna a ni sih a; chun, hieng thil thaw hin, hluo ding Jordan in va kân rama chun in dam sâwt ding a nih,” a ta."
48,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,","Chun, chu ni vêk chun LALPA- IN Mosie a biek a,"
49,"Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;","“Moab rama Jeriko zâwna Abarim tlângdung Nebo tlânga chun hang fe la, Israel thlahai hluo dinga ka pêk Kanaan ram chu hang thlîr rawh."
50,"and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:","Chuongchun, i unaupa Aron Hor tlângah a thih a, a chihai kuoma ṭhuoi a ni ta ang bawk khan i hang lâwnna tlânga chun thîng i ta; i chihai kuoma ṭhuoi nîng i tih;"
51,"because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.",Zin thlalêra Kades-a Meriba tuia Israel thlahai laia ka chunga in suol lei le Israel thlahai laia in mi chawimawi naw lei khan.
52,For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.,"Ram chu hang hmûng i ta, nisienlakhawm, Israel thlahai ka pêk rama chun lût naw ti nih,” tiin."
