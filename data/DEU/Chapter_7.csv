1,"When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;","“LALPA in Pathienin in va hluo ding rama a ṭhuoi lût cheu a, in hmaa hnam tamtak, Hit mihai, Girgas mihai, Amor mihai, Kanaan mihai, Periz mihai, Hiv mihai, Jebus mihai dâm, nangni nêka ropui le thilthawthei hnam sarihai a hnawt suok pha,"
2,"and when Jehovah thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them;","in sukbohmang vawng ding a nih; anni le chun thu in thlung ding a ni nawh a, in lunginsiet ding khawm a ni nawh."
3,"neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.","Nuhmei pasalah in nei ding a ni bawk nawh, in naunuhmeihai chu an naupasalhai leh in inneitir ding a ni bawk nawh."
4,"For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.","In nau a mi zui laihai hi Pathien danghai biekna tieng ṭhuoi kawi el an ta; chun, LALPA lung khawm chu in chungah hung inthawk a ta, suk- bohmang vak el a ti cheu."
5,"But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.","An chungah hieng ang hin in thaw lem ding a nih, an mâichâmhai sukchim in ta, an lungphunhai suknâwi in ta, an Aserahai phûr in ta, an milim siemfâwmhai in raw vawng ding a nih."
6,"For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God: Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.","LALPA in Pathien ta dingin hnam inthieng in ni sih a, leilunga hnam po poa inthawk ama chanpuol bîk ni dinga LALPA in Pathienin a thlang cheu a nih."
7,"Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples:","“Hnam dang nêka in tam leiin LALPAIN in chungah a hmangaina ân fûktir a, a thlang cheu a ni nawh a; hnam po poa hnam tlâwm tak in nih in sawnnaw."
8,"but because Jehovah loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.","LALPAIN a hmangai cheu lei le, in pi le puhai kuoma ṭawng a lo inkhâm chu hlen a nuom leiin a nih, LALPAIN Aiguptaa lal Pharao kuta inthawka kut hrâttakin suoka in- thawka a sansuok cheu chu."
9,"Know therefore that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,","Chuleiin, LALPA in Pathien chu Pathien a nih ti hre ro; Pathien ringum, ama hmangaia a thu zâwmtu chunga suon sâng chena thuthlung le lunginsietna innghat zing a,"
10,"and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.",ama theidatuhai sukbohmang dinga anni chung ngeia thung hlak a nih; ama theidatuhai chu riel sâwt naw ni a; anni chunga ngei thung a tih.
11,"Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.","Chuleiin, thupêk dâm, thuruot dâm, rorêl dâm, zâwm dinga vawi- sûna thu ka pêk cheu hi in zâwm ding a nih."
12,"And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the lovingkindness which he sware unto thy fathers:","“Hieng rorêlhai hi in ngai a, in zâwm a, in thaw leiin LALPA in Pathienin in pi le puhai kuoma ṭawng a lo inkhâm thuthlung le lunginsiet- na chu in chungah innghat a ta;"
13,"and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.","hmangai a ti cheu a, malsâwm a ti cheu a, sukpung a ti cheu a, pêk dinga in pi le puhai kuoma ân khâmna rama chun in rila ra le in hnuoi ra khawm malsâwm bawk a tih, in bu dâm, in uoin dâm, in hriek dâm, in bâwngtehai le in berâmtehai khawm."
14,"Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.","Hnam po po laia chun malsâwm ni bîk in ta, nangni lai a nuhmei a pasalin a ching hrim hrim um naw ni hai, in ran laia khawm."
15,"And Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.","Chun, LALPA chun hri po po sukkiengpêk vawng a ti cheu a, in hriet ta hnung Aigupta ram hrihai chu in chungah inlêngtir naw nih a, a theidatuhai po po chungah inlêngtir lem a tih."
16,And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.,"LALPA in Pathienin a pêk ding cheu hnamhai po po chu in sukbo- hmang vawng ding a nih, in lungin- siet ding a ni nawh a, an Pathien rawng khawm in bâwl ding a ni nawh; in ta dingin châng a ni el ding a ni sih a."
17,"If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?","“In lungrilah ‘Hieng hnamhai hi ei ni nêkin an tam sih a, ieng tin am hnawt suok thei ei ta?’ ti in ni chun anni chu ṭi naw ro."
18,"thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;","LALPA in Pathienin Pharao le Aigupta mi po po chunga thil a thawhai kha hre zing ro,"
19,"the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.","fiena nasatakin in mit ngeia in hmuhai, inchikna dâm, thilmak dâm, kut hrâttak dâm, bân phar dâma LALPA in Pathienin a ṭhuoi suokna cheu kha; khâng ang khan LALPA in Pathienin in mi ṭihai chunga chun thaw pei a tih."
20,"Moreover Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.","LALPA in Pathien chun anni lai chun khuoingal tir nâwk nghâl a ta; a la dam, nangnia inthawka inbi- hmanghai chu an bohmang vawng chenin."
21,"Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.","Anni chu in ṭi ding a ni nawh; LALPA in Pathien chu nangni lai a um sih a, Pathien ropuitak, ṭiumtak el chu."
22,"And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.","LALPA in Pathien chun chuong hnamhai chu damte tein hnawt suokpêk hret hret a ti cheu a; a suk- bohmang vawng el nghâl ding a ni nawh, chuong naw chun ramsahai in pawi tâwk khawpin hung pung rawi an tih."
23,"But Jehovah thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.","An bohmang hma khat chu LALPA in Pathienin anni pêng a ti cheu a, buoi namênin anni sukbuoi naw nih."
24,"And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.","An lalhai chu in kutah pêng a ta, an hming chu vânkhuphnuoia inthawk hin in thaihmang dai ding a nih; in sukbohmang dêr chenin in hmaa ngîr thei tukhawm um hrim hrim naw ni hai."
25,"The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.","An Pathien lim siem fâwmhai chu in raw ding a nih, chutaka tangkaruo amanih, rângkachak ama- nih chu in inhnar ding a ni nawh a; in ta dingin in lâk ding a ni bawk nawh, chuong naw chun âwk el rawi in tih; LALPA in Pathien ngaiin thil tirdakum an ni sih a."
26,"And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.","In in sûngah thil tirdakum la lûtin chu thil ang chun ṭawngse- phurah in insiem ding a ni nawh; tirdakum namên loa tirdakin in theida hle ding a nih, ṭawngsephur thil a ni sih a."
