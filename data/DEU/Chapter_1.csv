7,"turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.","insawn ta unla, fe suok unla, Amor mihai tlâng rama le a kâwl vêl po po Arabaa dâm, tlâng rama dâm, phai rama dâm, Sim rama dâm, Kanaan mihai umna tuisuoriet pang- haia le Lebanona dâm, vadungpui Euphrates vadung chenin fe ro."
8,"Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.","Ngai ta u, ram chu ka pêk dai ta cheu, in pu Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai le an hnunga an thla nâwk peihai kuoma inkhâma LALPAIN a pêk ram chu va hluo ro,’ tiin."
9,"And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:","“Horeb tlânga ei umlai khan in kuomah, ‘Keima ngawt chun ka zo naw cheu a,"
10,"Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.","LALPA in Pathien chun a suk- pung cheu a, ngai ta u, tuhin chu in tamzie chu vâna arasi zât zet in hung ni tah a."
11,"Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!","LALPA in pi le puhai Pathien chun tuta nêka a let sângin sukpung sienla cheu, a tiem cheu angin mal- sâwm raw se cheu."
12,"How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?","Iengtin am keima khât chauin in buoina dâm, in phurrik dâm, in inngâwknahai chu phur zo ka ta?"
13,"Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.","In hnam laia mi, mi var, hmang- châng hre mi, chinchâng hre mi dâm inthlang suok unla, in chungah ho- tuah siem ka tih,’ tiin ka biek cheu a."
14,"And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.","Chun, nangnîn, ‘I thil hril chu kan ta dingin a ṭha hle el,’ tiin in mi dawn a."
15,"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.","Chuongchun, in hnam hotuhai chu ka pawm a, in hnam laia mi, mi var, chinchâng hre mihai in chungah hotuah ka siem a, sâng chunga hotu dâm, za chunga hotu dâm, sâwmnga chunga hotu dâm, sâwm chunga hotu dâm, ṭhuoituhai khawm."
16,"And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him.","Chuong lai chun in rorêltuhai kuoma chun, ‘In unauhai kâra thu chu ngaipêk unla, unau le unau kâra le ram danga mi, a umpui le inkâra khawm feltakin rêl ro."
17,"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.","Rorêlnaah thlierbîk in nei ding a ni nawh; mi chîn le mi lien inang zingin in ngaipêk ding a nih; tu- khawm in ṭi ding a ni nawh; rorêlna chu Pathien ta a ni sih a; in ta dinga thu khir taluo chu ka kuomah hung intlun hlak in ta, chu chu lo ngaituo hlak ka tih,’ tiin thu ka pêk a."
18,And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.,"Chun, chuong lai chun thil in thaw dân ding po poah thu ka pêk cheu a."
19,"And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.","“Chun, LALPAIN thu a mi pêk angin Horeb tlânga inthawk chun ei suok a, Amor mihai tlâng ram lampuia thlalêr lientak le râpthlâk- tak in hmu kha ei fe thleng vawng a, Kades-barneaa chun ei hung tlung a."
20,"And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.","Chun, in kuomah, ‘LALPA ei Pathienin a mi pêk Amor mihai tlâng ram chu in hung tlung tah a;"
21,"Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.","Ngai ta u, LALPA in Pathien chun ram chu a pêk diem ta cheu a nih; hang fe unla, LALPA in pi le pu Pathienin a lo hril ta ang khan hang hluo el ta ro; ṭi naw unla, thaidâwp bawk naw ro,’ ka tih a."
22,"And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.","Chun, ka kuomah in hung vawng a, ‘A ram chu va enthla a, kan hang fena ding lampui le kan va fena ding khaw chinchâng dâm mi hung hril nâwk dingin kan hmaah mi va tir inlang,’ in tih a."
23,"And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:","Chu thu chun a mi suklâwm hle el a, chuongchun, nangni laia mi sâwmpahni, hnam khatah pakhat pei ka thlang a:"
24,"and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.","chuongchun, an suok tah a, tlânga chun an hang lâwn a, Eskol ruom an hang tlung a, an hang enthlâk vawng a."
25,"And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.","Chu rama thei dâm chu an lo a, an mi hung phurpêk a, chanchin an mi hung intlun a, ‘LALPA ei Pathienin ram a mi pêk chu ṭhatak a nih,’ an tih a."
26,"Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God:","Nisienlakhawm, in hang fe nuom nawh a, LALPA in Pathien thupêk chu in helsan a;"
27,"and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.","in puon inhaia chun in chier a, ‘LALPA chun a mi theida leiin mi sukbohmang dinga Amor mihai kuta pêk dingin Aigupta rama inthawkin a mi ṭhuoi suok a nih."
28,"Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.","Iengdingin am chu chun hang fêng ei ta? Ei unauhai chun, Mihriem chu eini nêkin an lien a, an insâng lem bawk a; khuohai chu a lien tâwl hle a, vân tawngin kulhai a nei a; chun, Anakim thlahai khawm chu kan hang hmu bawk a, tiin kan lungril an sukzawp a,’ in tih a."
29,"Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.","Kei chun in kuomah, ‘Anni chu ṭi naw unla, huphur bawk naw ro."
30,"Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,","LALPA in Pathien in hmaṭhuoi- tu chun in mithmua Aigupta rama a thawpêk ta cheu po pohai ang khan thawpui a ti cheu a,"
31,"and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that Jehovah thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.","thlalêra khawm miin a nau a puok angin, LALPA in Pathien chun hi hmun in tlung chen hin lampui intluonin a puokzie cheu in hmu kha,’ ka tih a."
32,"Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,",Chuonghai po ka hril sa khawmin LALPA in Pathien chu in ring nawh;
33,"who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.","in puon in in zarna ding hmun zawngpêk ding cheu le in lampui khîkhmu ding cheua zânah meia, sûnah sûma hmaṭhuoitu chu."
34,"And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,","“Chun, LALPAIN in thu hril chu a lo hriet a, a lunginsen a,"
35,"Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,","‘Hi suon rilotaka mi hin chu pakhat bêk khawmin in pi le puhai pêk dinga ka înkhâmna ram ṭhatak chu hmu naw tawp an tih,"
36,"save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.","Jephunne naupa Kaleb chau naw chun; ama chun chu hmûng a tih, a va sir tah ram chu ama le a nauhai pêng ka tih, ama chun LAL- PA chu titakzeta a zui tlat leiin,’ tiin ân khâm a."
37,"Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither:","“Nangni leiin ka chunga khawm LALPA chu a lunginsen a, ‘Nang khawm hi chutaka chun lût naw ti nih."
38,"Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.","I rawngbâwltu Nun naupa Josua hi chu lût a tih, ama hi infui rawh; Israel mihai chu ân hluotir ding a nih."
39,"Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.","In nau le tehai, râllâkin la el an ta, in tihai hi, tuta a sie a ṭha la hre lo in nauhai hi lût an tih, anni chu pêng ka ta, hluong an tih."
40,"But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.","Nangni ruok chu insawn unla, Tuisuoriet Sen tiengah thlalêrah fe ro,’ tiin."
41,"Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.","“Chun, nangnîn, ‘LALPA chung- ah kan lo suol a ni tah, hang fêng kan ta, LALPA kan Pathienin a mi pêk ang po poin hang thâwng kan tih,’ tiin in mi dawn a, chuong- chun, indona thuomhnaw in inbel seng a, tlânga hang fe chu in invaksier a."
42,"And Jehovah said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.","Chun, LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Hang fe naw ro, hang thaw bawk naw ro; nangni lai ka um si nawh a, in hmêlmahai chun lo sukhlum pal rawi an ti cheu, an kuomah ti rawh,’ a mi tih a."
43,"So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.","Chu chu ka hril cheu a, in pawm nawh a, LALPA thupêk chu in helsan ta lem a, tlânga chun in hang fe hrâm tah a."
44,"And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.","Chun, chu tlânga um Amor mihai chun an lo thaw cheu a, khuoi mi hnawt ang elin an lo hnawt cheu a; Seira inthawka Horma chenin an that cheu a."
45,"And ye returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.","Chun, in hung kîr nâwk a, LALPA hmaah in ṭap a; nisienla- khawm, LALPA chun in râwl chu a ngai nuom nawh a, a na khawm a hung sit nuom nawh."
46,"So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.","Chuleichun, Kades-a chun sâwttak in um a ni kha."
