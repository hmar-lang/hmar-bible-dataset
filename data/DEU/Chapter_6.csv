6,"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;","Chun, hieng thu, vawisûna ka pêk cheu hi in lungrilah châm zing a ta,"
7,"and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.","in nauhai ṭhahnemngaitakin in- chûktir in ta, in ina in ṭhung lai dâm, lampuia in fe lai dâm, in zâl lai dâm, in tho huna khawm in hril hlak ding a nih."

9,"And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.","In in kawtkhâr biengahai, in kawtkhârahai in ziek ding a nih."
10,"And it shall be, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee, great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not,","“Chun, LALPA in Pathienin in pu Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai kuoma inkhâma a pêk cheu ram, in indin ni dêr lo, khaw ropui le mawi- tak tak dâm,"
11,"and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full;","in suksip ni dêr lo, thil ṭha tinrênga sip in dâm, in cho ni dêr lo, tuikhur chosa dâm, in chîng ni dêr lo, grêp huon le Oliv thinghai dâm umnaah a ṭhuoi lût cheu a, in fâk a in tlai hle pha chun,"

14,"Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you;",Pathien dang in vêla mihai pathien chu in biek ding a ni nawh.
15,"for Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God; lest the anger of Jehovah thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth.","Nangni laia um LALPA in Pathien chu Pathien thîkthusie a nih; LALPA in Pathien lung chu in chungah inthawk a ta, leihnuoia inthawk hin sukbohmang el rawi a ti cheu."
16,"Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.",“Massaa in fie ang khan LALPA in Pathien chu in fie ding a ni nawh.
17,"Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.","LALPA in Pathienin a pêk cheu, thupêk dâm, a thuinhriettir dâm, a thuruot dâm, fîmkhurtakin in zâwm ding a nih."
18,"And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers,","LALPA mithmua indik le ṭha chu in thaw ding a nih; in tluongtlung theina ding le LALPAIN in pi le puhai kuoma inkhâma a lo tiem tah ram ṭhatak chu in va hluo theina dinga,"
19,"to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.",in hmêlmahai po po in hmaa hnawt suok dinga LALPAIN a lo hril ta ang khan.
20,"When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?","“Chun, in unauhaiin ‘LALPA ei Pathienin thu a pêk cheu thuin- hriettir dâm, thuruot dâm, rorêl dam chu iengtizie am a nih a?’ tih a na- kie hun tienga an la hung indawn cheu chun, nangnîn in nauhai kuomah,"
21,"then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt: and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;","‘Aigupta rama Pharao suok ei na, LALPAIN Aiguptaa inthawk chun kut hrâttakin a mi ṭhuoi suok a;"
22,"and Jehovah showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes;","chun, LALPAIN ei mithmuah Aigupta ram chunga dâm, Pharao chunga dâm, a sûnghai po po chunga dâm, inchikna le thilmak nasatak le lunginzîng umtakhai ân entir a;"
23,"and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.","eini ruok chu mi pêk dinga ei pi le puhai kuoma ṭawng a lo inkhâm- na, chu ram chu a mi pêk theina dingin chutaka inthawk chu a mi ṭhuoi suok a."
24,"And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.","Chuongchun, hieng dânhai po po hi zâwm ding le ei ṭhat zingna dinga LALPA ei Pathien chu ṭi dingin LALPA chun thu a mi pêk a, vawisûn nia anga mi dama a mi hla theina dingin."
25,"And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Jehovah our God, as he hath commanded us.","A thu mi pêk anga LALPA hmaa a thupêk po po zâwm dinga ei fîmkhur chun ei ta dingin felna a ni ding a nih,’ in ti ding a nih."
