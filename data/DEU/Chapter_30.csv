2,"and shalt return unto Jehovah thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;","LALPA in Pathien tieng chu in ngha nâwk a, tuta thu ka pêk cheu ang hin nangni le in nauhai leh in lungril po po le in lungvar po poa a rawl in zâwm pha chun,"
3,"that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee.","LALPA in Pathien chun in sal nina chu sukbo a ta, lunginsiet a ti cheu a, LALPA in Pathienin hnam tin laia a sukdarna cheua inthawk chun ṭhuoi khâwm nâwk a ti cheu."
4,"If any of thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:","Nangni laia mi kâwlkawdawng chena hnawtdawk an um chun, LALPA in Pathien chun chutaka inthawk chun ṭhuoi khâwm a ti cheu a, chutaka inthawk chun ṭhuoikîr nâwk a ti cheu."
5,"and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.","Chun, LALPA in Pathienin in pi le puhaiin an hluo rama khan ṭhuoi lût nâwk a ti cheu a; hluong in ta, amân sukvângnei a ti cheu a, in pi le puhai khûmin sukpung a ti cheu."
6,"And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.",In hring theina dinga LALPA in Pathien chu in lungril po po le in lungvar po poa in hmangai theina dingin LALPA in Pathienin in lungril le in thlahai lungril ser chu tanpêk a ti cheu a.
7,"And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee.","LALPA in Pathienin hieng ṭawngsiehai po po hi a suknawm- natuhai cheu, in hmêlmahai le a theidatuhai cheu chungah inumtir a tih."
8,"And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.","Chun, hung ngha nâwk in ta, LALPA râwl hi pawm in ta, vawisûna thu ka pêk cheu, a thupêk po pohai hi zâwm in tih."
9,"And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;","LALPA in Pathien chun in kutsuok po poahai, in rila raahai, in bâwng ruol pungahai, in hnuoi raahai nasatakin sukpung a ti cheu a, in pi le puhai chunga a lâwm ang khan in chungah LALPA lâwm nâwk a tih;"
10,"if thou shalt obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.","hi dân bua chuong, a thupêk dâm, a dânhai dâm, zâwm dinga LALPA rawl chu in zâwm a, in lungril po po le in lungvar po poa LALPA in Pathien tieng chu in ngha phawt chun."
11,"For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.","“Hi thupêk tuta ka pêk cheu hi in ta dingin ân tak nawh a, a hlat naw bawk cheu a nih."
12,"It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?","‘Kan hrieta kan zâwm theina dingin tu am vânah mi hang fepêk a ta, mi hang lapêk ding?’ ti dingin vâna mi a ni nawh a,"
13,"Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?","‘kan hrieta kan zâwm theina dingin tuisuoriet râlah tu am mi fepêk a ta, mi hung lapêk a ta?’ ti dingin tuisuoriet râla mi khawm a ni chuong nawh."
14,"But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.","In zâwm theina dingin thu chun a hnai hle cheu a, in baua le in lungrilah a um a nih."
15,"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;","“Tuhin in hmaah hringna le ṭhatna, thina le thil ṭha naw ka sieh a."
16,"in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.","LALPA in Pathien hmangai ding dâmin, a lampui hraw ding dâm, a thupêk dâm, a dânhai dâm, a rorêlhai dâm pawm dinga tuta thu ka pêk cheu hi in zâwm chun damin um in ta, hung pung in ta, in va hluo ding rama chun LALPA in Pathienin mal a sâwm ding cheu a nih."
17,"But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;","Amiruokchu, in lungrilin khaw dang a nghah a, in ngai nawh a, ṭhuoihmanga in um a, pathien dang- hai in biek a, a rawng dâm in bâwl chun,"
18,"I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it.","bohmang ngei ngei in tih, ti tuhin ka hril cheu a nih, Jordan vadung kaia hluo dinga in va lût- na ding rama chun dam sâwt naw ti niu."
19,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed;","In hmaah hringna le thina, malsâwmna le ṭawngsie ka sie ti tuhin in chungchâng thua hretu dingin hnuoi le vân ka sâl a nih; chuongchun, hringna chu thlang ro, in hring theina dingin, nangni le in thlahai leh;"
20,"to love Jehovah thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.","LALPA in Pathien hmangaia, a râwl ngaia, ama cheltlatin, ama chu in hringna, in dam sâwtna a ni sih a; chuongchun, in pu Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai inkhâma pêk a tiem rama chun in um ding annawm,” tiin."
