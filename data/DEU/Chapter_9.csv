1,"Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,","“Aw Israel mihai, ngai ta u, in nêka ropui le thilthawthei lem hnam, khawpui vân tawnga kul nei le ropuitakhai chu va hluo dingin tuhin Jordan chu in kai ding a ni tah a,"
2,"a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?","mi lientak tak le insângtak tak in hriet ta sahai Anak thlahai, ‘Anak thlahai chu tuin am ngam ei ta?’ in ti hlakhai ram chu."
3,"Know therefore this day, that Jehovah thy God is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath spoken unto thee.","Chuleiin, LALPA in Pathien chu mi kângbohmang mei anga in hmaa fe hlak chu a nih ti tuhin hre ro; ama chun anni chu sukbohmang a ta, suktlâwmpêk a ti cheu; chuongchun, LALPAIN in kuoma a hril ta ang khan, anni chu hnawt suok in ta, sukbohmang vak el in tih."
4,"Speak not thou in thy heart, after that Jehovah thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah doth drive them out from before thee.","LALPA in Pathienin a hnawt suokpêk hnung cheu chun, ‘Ei felna leiin hi ram hi hluo dingin LALPAIN a mi ṭhuoi lût a nih,’ in lungrilin ti dêr naw ro; hieng hnamhai hi an suol leiin a nih LALPAIN a hnawt suok- pêk ding cheu chu."
5,"Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.","In fel leiin amanih, in lungril indik leiin amanih an ram chu in hluo ding a ni nawh a, hieng hnamhai suol lei le LALPA in pu Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai kuoma ân khâmna thu suknghet dingin LALPA in Pathienin anni chu a hnawt suokpêk ding cheu a ni lem."
6,"Know therefore, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.","Chuleiin, hi ram ṭhatak hi in fel leia hluo dingin LALPAIN a pêk cheu a ni nawh ti hre ro; hnam kâwmaw- tak in ni sih a."
7,"Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah.","“Thlalêra LALPA lung in suksen hlakziehai dâm kha hre zing unla, theinghil naw ro. Aigupta rama inthawka in suok nia inthawka hi hmun in hung tlung chen hin LALPA chunga helhmang in na."
8,"Also in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you to destroy you.","Horeba khawm khan LALPA lung in suksen a, sukbohmang hiel el ding cheuin LALPA lung a sen a."
9,"When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.","Lungphêk, in kuoma LALPAIN thu a thlungna lungphêk la dinga tlânga ka hang fe lai khan ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli tlânga chun ka hang um a; bei khawm ka fâk nawh a, tui khawm ka dâwn bawk nawh a."
10,"And Jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which Jehovah spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.","LALPA chun lungphêk pahni, Pathien kutpâra ziek chu a mi pêk a; chutaka chun in pungkhâwm nia tlâng chunga meia inthawka LALPA- IN in kuoma thu a hrilhai po po kha a chuong vawng a."
11,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.","Ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli hnung- a chun lungphêk pahni, thuthlungna lungphêk chu a mi pêk a."
12,"And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.","LALPA chun ka kuomah, ‘Tho la, hi taka inthawk hin fe thla vat rawh, Aigupta rama i ṭhuoi suok i mihai chu an insuksiet zo ta khu; hraw dinga thu ka pêk kawnga inthawk chun an pêt ta pang el a, milim sung fâwm an ta dingin an siem el ta khu,’ a tih a."
13,"Furthermore Jehovah spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:","“Chun, LALPA chun, ‘Hieng mihai hi ka en rên rên a, hnam kâwmawtak an nih;"
14,"let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.","anni sukbohmang ding le vânkhuphnuoia inthawka an hming thaihmang dingin ka law law hang lâwng ka tih a; chun, nangmaa inthawkin anni nêka hnam thil- thawthei le ropui lem siem ka tih’, tiin a mi biek bawk a."
15,"So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.","Chuongchun, tlânga inthawk chu ka hung thlah a, tlâng chu a kâng tah a; thuthlungna lungphêk pahni chu ka kut khinghniin ka chawi a."
16,"And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you.","Chun, ka hei thlîr a, LALPA in Pathien chunga chun in lo suol tah a, bâwngte lim sung fâwm in insiem a, LALPAIN thu a pêk cheu lampuia inthawk chun in pêt pang el tah ti ka hmuh a."
17,"And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.","Chun, lungphêk pahni chu ka dawm a, ka kut khinghnia inthawk chun ka pei a, in mithmua chun ka sukkawi a."
18,"And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.","Chun, kha hmaa ka thaw ang khan ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli LALPA hmaah ka bawkkhup a; a lung suksen dinga LALPA mithmua in thil suksuol tah in suolna po po leiin bei khawm ka fâk nawh a, tui khawm ka dâwn bawk nawh."
19,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also.","Nangni sukbohmang dinga LALPA lunginsenna, a lungsenna le a lungâwinawna nasatak chu ka ṭi sih a. Nisienlakhawm, chu ṭum khawm chun LALPAIN ka thu chu a mi ngaipêk a."
20,And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.,"Chun, LALPA chu, Aron chu sukbohmang nuom khawp hielin a lunginsen a; nisienlakhawm, Aron khawm chu ka ṭawngṭaipêk nghâl bawk a."
21,"And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.","In suolna leia in siem bâwngte lim chu ka lâk a, ka rawh a, ka suknâwi a, pilvut angin ka rawt- nawi dar a; a phit chu tlânga in- thawka vadung hung luonga chun ka phul a."
22,"And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.","“Taberaa dâm, Massaa dâm, Kibroth-hattaavaa dâm khawm LALPA chu in suklungsen a."
23,"And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.","Chun, LALPAIN, ‘Ram ka pêk cheu chu hang hluo ro’, tiha Kades- barneaa inthawka a tir lai cheu khan LALPA in Pathien thupêk chu in helsan a, ama chu in ring nawh a, a râwl khawm in ngai bawk nawh a."
24,Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.,Ka hriet tîr cheua inthawk tah LALPA chunga hel hmang mi in ni hrim a.
25,"So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN ‘Sukbo- hmang ka tih’ a ti cheu lei khan LALPA hmaah ka bawkkhup a, ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli ka bawkkhup kha."
26,"And I prayed unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.","Chun, LALPA kuoma chun ka ṭawngṭai a, ‘Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, i ropuinaa în tlan, kut hrâttaka Aigup- taa inthawka în tlansuok, i mihai le i rochanhai chu sukbohmang naw rawh."
27,"Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,","I siehlaw Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai chu hre zing la, hieng mihai hi an kâwmaw sietzie dâm, an rîtlozie dâm, an suolziehai en naw rawh;"
28,"lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.","chuong naw chun, i mi ṭhuoi suokna rama mihai chun, LALPAIN a ram tiema chun a ṭhuoi thei naw leiin, thlalêra that dingin a ṭhuoi suok a nih, ti rawi an tih."
29,"Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm.","I thilthawtheina ropuitak le i bân phara i ṭhuoi suok, i mihai le i rochanhai an ni tlat sih a,’ ka tih a."
