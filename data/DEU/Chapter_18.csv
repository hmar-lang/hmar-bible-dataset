1,"The priests the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and his inheritance.","“Thiempu Levi mihai, Levi hnam po po chun Israel mihai lai chanvo le rochan an nei ding a ni nawh a; LALPA kuoma meia thilin- hlân le a chana mi chu an fâk ding a nih."
2,"And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren: Jehovah is their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them.","An unauhai laia chun rochan an nei ding a ni nawh a, an rochan chu an kuoma a hril angin LALPA a ni sih a."
3,"And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.","Inthâwina inhlântu mipuihaia inthawka thiempu chanpuol ding chu hieng hi nîng a tih: bâwngchal khawm, berâm khawm a dâr le bek- bawr khing hni le a phîngpui chu thiempu an pêk ding a nih."
4,"The first-fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.","In bu le bâlhai, in uoinhai le in hriek sâwrhai a hmasa takhai le in berâm hmul vâw hmasa tak dâm chu in pêk ding a nih."
5,"For Jehovah thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Jehovah, him and his sons for ever.","LALPA in Pathienin LALPA hminga rawngbâwla um kumkhuo dingin in hnam po po laia inthawka a thlang an ni sih a, anni le an naupasalhai leh."
6,"And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which Jehovah shall choose;","“Chun, Levi mi tukhawm a umna Israel ram in umna khâwlai hmun khawm suoksana, a lungrila inhâwk- taka LALPAIN a la ruot ding hmuna hung chu,"
7,"then he shall minister in the name of Jehovah his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before Jehovah.","chutaka LALPA hmaa um hlak Levi mihai, a unauhai ang bawkin LALPA a Pathien hmingin rawng a bâwl ding a nih."
8,"They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.",An thiempu man bâkah mi dang chanpuol ang fâk ding chu chang ve tho an tih.
9,"When thou art come into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.",“LALPA in Pathienin a pêk cheu ram in va tlung pha chun chuong hnamhai thil tirdakum thaw hai ang chu in chîng ve ding a ni nawh.
10,"There shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, one that practiseth augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,","A naupa amanih, a naunu ama- nih, meia infethlengtir dâm, aisân chîng dâm, aien chîng dâm, mitdawi- vai hmang dâm, dâwithiem dâm,"
11,"or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.","dâwi invêt thiem dâm, khawhri zâwl ruoi dâm, thiemrâu dâm, mithi biek chîng mihai dâm chu nangni lai an um ding a ni nawh."
12,For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah: and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee.,"Hieng thil thaw mi taphawthai chu LALPA ngaiin mi tirdakum an ni sih a; hieng thil tirdakumhai lei hin a nih, LALPA in Pathien chun anni a hnawtsuokpêk cheu chu."
13,Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God.,LALPA in Pathien hmaa chun demkailo in ni ding a nih.
14,"For these nations, that thou shalt dispossess, hearken unto them that practise augury, and unto diviners; but as for thee, Jehovah thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.","Chuong in va hluo ding rama hnamhai chun aisân le aien dâm an chîng hlak a, an pawm bawk a, nang- ni ta ding chun LALPA in Pathienin chuong ang thaw chu a phal naw a nih."
15,"Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;","“LALPA in Pathienin keima ang hi in unauhai laia mi, zâwlnei siem- pêk a ti cheu; a thu chu in zâwm ding a nih."
16,"according to all that thou desiredst of Jehovah thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.","‘LALPA kan Pathien râwl chu mîn hriettir ta naw, hi mei nasatak hi mîn hmutir nâwk ta naw rawh, chuong naw chun thi rawi kan tih,’ tiha Horeb tlânga pungkhâwm niha LALPA in Pathien in dit dân ang khan."
17,"And Jehovah said unto me, They have well said that which they have spoken.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, ‘An thuhril chu an hril ṭha hle a."
18,"I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.","An unauhai laia inthawkin nangma ang zâwlnei siempêk ka ta; a bauah ka thuhai sieng ka ta, a kuoma thu ka pêk taphawt chu an kuomah hril a tih."
19,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.","Chun, ka hminga ka thu a hril pawm naw taphawt chu ngaituong ka tih."
20,"But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.","Ka hminga hril dinga ka pêk naw hril luitu zâwlnei amanih, pathien danghai hminga thuhriltu zâwlnei amanih, chu zâwlnei chu sukhlum ding a nih,’"
21,"And if thou say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah hath not spoken?","Chun, in lungrilah, ‘Iengtin am thu chu LALPA hril a ni nawh ti hrieng ei ta?’ in ti a ni chun,"
22,"when a prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which Jehovah hath not spoken: the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.","zâwlneiin LALPA hminga thu a hril a, a thu hril chu a hung tlung nawh a, a hlawtling naw chun, chu chu a nih LALPA ihril naw chu; zâwlnei chun uongtakin a hril mei mei a ni lem, ama chu in ṭi ding a ni nawh."
