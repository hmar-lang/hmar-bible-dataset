1,"Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei.","“Chuongchun, ei insawn a, Basan lampuiah ei feh a, Basan lal Og le a mihai po po chu Edreia mi thaw dingin an hung inthawk a."
2,"And Jehovah said unto me, Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.","Chun, LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Ama chu ṭi naw rawh, ama le a mihai po po le a ram chu i kutah ka pêk diem tah a nih; Hesbona um Amor mihai lal Sihon chunga i thaw ang khan a chungah i thaw ding a nih,’ a tih a."
3,"So Jehovah our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.","Chuongchun, LALPA ei Pathien chun Basan lal Og khawm a mihai po po leh ei kutah a pêk a; chuongchun, pakhat bêk khawm hlapêk loin ei that a."
4,"And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.","Chu ṭum chun a khuo po po, khuo sâwmruk, Basana Og ram Argob ram po po chu ei lâk vawng a; ei lâkpêk naw khuo pakhat bêk khawm a um nawh."
5,"All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.","Hieng khuo po po hi kul in- sângtak tak, kawtkhâr le kalna nei vawng a nih, kul nei lo khuo tamtak tiem lo khawma."
6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.","Hesbon lal Sihon chunga ei thaw ang khan ei sukbohmang vawng a, khuo po po chu ei sukbohmang vawng a, pasal, nuhmei le an naupanghai chenin ei sukbohmang vawng a."
7,"But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves.","Amiruokchu, ran po po le, khuoa râllâka ei lâk thilhai chu ei chanpuol dingin ei lâk a."
8,"And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon",Chu ṭum chun Jordan râla um Amor mihai lal pahni kuta inthawk chun Arnon ruoma inthawka Hermon tlâng chenin ei lâk a;
9,"(which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir);","(chu Hermon chu Zidon mihai chun Sirion an tih a, Amor mihai chun Senir an ti thung a.)"
10,"all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.","Phai ram khuo po po le Gilead ram po po le Basan ram po po leh, Basan rama Og ram khuo, Saleka le Edrei chenin ei lâk a."
11,"(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.)","(Basan lal Og chau a nih, Repha mihai laia la um sun chu; a khum chu thîr a na, Ammon thlahai khuo Rabaa chun a la um zing a ni naw am a nih? Mihriem tawnga inkhiin a dungtieng tawng kuo, a khangtieng tawng li a nih.)"
12,"And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites:","“Chu ṭum chun, chu ram chu ei hluo a; Arnon ruom kâwla Aroera inthawkin Gilead tlâng ram chenve chenin, chutaka khaw umhai leh, Reuben mihai le Gad mihai ka pêk a;"
13,"and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.",Gilead ram la um po le Og ram Basan po po chu Manasse hnam zâtvehai ka pêk a; Argob ram po po le Basan ram po po chu. (Hi hi Repha mihai ram an ti bawk hlak a.
14,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.)","Manasse naupa Jair chun Argob ram po po Gesur mihai le Maakat mihai ram chenin a lâk a; chuongchun, Basan chu, ama hming chawiin Havot-Jair a ta, tu chen hin an la ti zing.)"
15,And I gave Gilead unto Machir.,"Chun, Gilead ram chu Makir ka pêk a."
16,"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border thereof, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;","Chun, Reuben mihai le Gad mihai chu Gileada inthawka Arnon ruom, ruom laitak chenin an ram chin dingin ka pêk a, Ammon thlahai ramri, Jabbok vadung chenin;"
17,"the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.","chun, Araba le Jordan khawm ramri dingin Kinneretha inthawkin Pisga saktieng pangpêr hnuoia Tuisuoriet Al, Araba Tuisuoriet chenin."
18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valor.","“Chun, chuong lai chun ‘LALPA in Pathienin in chanpuol dingin hi ram hi a pêk cheu a nih, Israel thla, in unauhai hmaah in mi huoisenhai po po chu inrâlthuomin hang fe ve raw se."
19,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle (I know that ye have much cattle), shall abide in your cities which I have given you,","Amiruokchu, in nuhmeihai, in nauhai le in ranhai (ran in hau ti ka hriet a) in khuo ka ipêka cheu khan um raw hai se;"
20,"until Jehovah give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth them beyond the Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.","nangni anga in unauhai chu LALPAIN râlmuonga a siem hma le LALPA in Pathienin Jordan râla ram a pêk chu an hluo ve hmakhat chun; chuongchun, in puol seng dinga ka pêk seng cheua hin in hung nâwk seng ding annâwm,’ tiin thu ka pêk cheu a."
21,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall Jehovah do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over.","Chun, chuong lai bawk chun Josua chu, ‘LALPA in Pathienin chuong lal pahnihai chunga thil a thawhai po po chu i mitin a hmu vawng a, chuong ang tak bawk chun i lûtna ding ram po pohai chungah LALPA chun thâwng a tih."
22,"Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you.","Anni chu ṭi naw unla; a thaw- puitu cheu chu LALPA in Pathien a ni sih a,’ tiin thu ka pêk a."
23,"And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,","“Chu lai huna chun LALPA chu nasatakin ka ngên a,"
24,"O Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?","‘Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, i siehlaw kuoma hin i ropuizie le i kut hrâttak chu în langtir phawt chu a ni tah a; vâna manih, hnuoia hin amanih, i thilthaw ang le i thilthaw ropuitak ang hi thaw thei pathien tu am an um a?"
25,"Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.","Mîn kaitir la, Jordan râla ram ṭhatak, chu tlâng mâwitak le Lebanon chu mîn hmutir raw khai,’ tiin."
26,"But Jehovah was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.","Nisienlakhawm, nangni leiin LALPA chu ka chungah a lunginsen hleh a; ka thu chu a pawm nawh a, chuongchun, LALPA chun, ‘Hun ta raw se, hi thua hin mi be nâwk ta naw rawh."
27,"Get thee up unto the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.","Pisga tlâng sîpah hang chuong la, thlangtienga dâm, hmârtienga dâm, simtienga dâm i mit hang inlên la, hang thlîr rawh; Jordan hi i kân naw ding a ni sih a."
28,"But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.","Amiruokchu, Josua hi thu pe la, infui ṭha la, sukhrât rawh, hieng mipuihai hi a ṭhuoikai ding a na, i hang hmu ding ram chu ân hluotir ding a nih,’ a mi tih a."
29,So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.,"Chuongchun, Beth-peor ruoma khan ei um tah a ni kha."
