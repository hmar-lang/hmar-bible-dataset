1,"When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations, whose land Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;","“LALPA in Pathienin an ram a pêk cheu hnam LALPAIN a sukboa, in hluo a, an khuohaia dâm, an inhaia dâm in um pha chun,"
2,"thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.",LALPA in Pathienin hluo dinga a pêk cheu rama chun khuo pathum in ruot ding a nih.
3,"Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which Jehovah thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither.","Tuolthat taphawt an tlânlûtna dingin, LALPAIN ân hluotir ding cheu ram chu hmun thumah ṭhêng in ta, in ramrihai siem in ta, lampuihai in buotsai ding a nih."
4,"And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past;","Tuolthathai chutaka tlânlûta him theihai chu hienghai hi an nih; miin a tuolbâwm kha hmaa theidâna khawm nei chuong loa that paltu hai,"
5,"as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live:","mi a tuolbâwm le thing phûr dinga rama fea thing phûr dinga hrei a hang inlet a, hreipui tlawngin a tuolbâwm chu dênghlum el ta anghai hi, chu laia khuo pakhata chun tlân a ta, him a tih;"
6,"lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.","chuong naw chun thisen phuba latu chun a lunginsen inling laia tuolthattu chu hnawtin, lampui kâr a hlat leiin va hnawtphâkin va vaw- hlum hlau rawi a tih, tuta hmaa theidânahai nei chuong lo a ni leiin thi âwm a ni si nawh a."
7,"Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt set apart three cities for thee.","Chuleiin, ‘Khuo pathum in ta dingin in ruot ding a nih,’ tiin thu ka pêk cheu a nih."
8,"And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;","“Chun, LALPA in Pathienin in pi le puhai kuoma ṭawng a lo inkhâm anga in pi le puhai pêk a lo tiem ram chu a pêk cheu a,"
9,"if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:","LALPA in Pathien chu hmangai ding le a lampui hraw rawp dinga a thupêk po po, tuta thu ka pêk cheu hi in pawm a, in ram chu a suklien chun khuo pathum bâka hin in ta dingin khuo pathum dang belsa nâwk in tih;"
10,"that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.","LALPAIN hluo dinga a pêk cheu in ram sûnga pawitâwk lo thisen insuo a um nawh a, in chunga thisen a um nawna dingin."
11,"But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he dieth, and he flee into one of these cities;","Amiruokchu, miin a tuolbâwm chu a theida a, ân chân a, a thawh a, thi khawp raka a vuok a, chu khuo laia pakhata chun a tlân chun,"
12,"then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.","an khuo upahaiin mi tir sienla, chutaka inthawk chun va ṭhuoi hai sienla, sukhlum dingin thisen phuba latu kutah inhlân raw se."
13,"Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.","In lunginsiet ding a ni nawh a, in ta dinga ṭha dingin Israel rama inthawka pawitâwk lo thisen insuona chu in sukbo ding a nih."
14,"Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.","“LALPA in Pathienin in hluo dinga a pêk cheu ram, in hluo ding rama a hmaa an lo phun tah in inripui in tuolbâwm ramri chu in sawn ding a ni nawh."
15,"One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.","“Mi a rîtlona amanih, a suolna hrim hrim amanih hretu pakhat chau chu huntâwk naw nih; hretu pahni bâu amanih, hretu pathum bâu amaniha sukdet ding a nih."
16,"If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing,","Hretu fel lotakin mi thil thaw dik loa ân tum chun,"
17,"then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days;",an inkhingnaah an pahni chun LALPA hmaah chu huna thiempuhai le rorêltuhai hmaa chun an ngîr ding a nih.
18,"and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother;","Rorêltuhai chun nguntakin dap an ta; thuhretu chu hretu tehlêm a nih a, a unau chu khêla intum a nih ti hriet suok a ni chun,"
19,"then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.",a unau chunga thaw a lo tum ang chun a chungah in thaw ding a nih; chuong ang chun nangni laia thil ṭha naw chu in sukbo ding a nih.
20,"And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee.","Mi danghai chun hrieng an ta, ṭîng an ta, tuta hnung chuong ang thil ṭha naw hrim hrim chu nangni lai an thaw ta naw ding a nih."
21,"And thine eyes shall not pity; life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.","In lunginsiet ding a ni nawh a, hringna aiah hringna, mit aiah mit, ha aiah ha, kut aiah kut, ke aiah ke nîng a tih."
