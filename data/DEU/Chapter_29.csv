1,"These are the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.","Horeb tlânga an kuoma thu a thlung bâkah LALPAIN Moab rama Israel thlahai kuoma Mosie thu ân thlungtir, a thuthlung thuhai chu hieng hi a nih."
2,"And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Israel mi po po chu a ko a, an kuomah a hril a, “Aigupta rama Pharao chunga dâm, a mihai po po chunga dâm, a ram po po chunga dâm, in mithmu ngeia LALPAIN thil a thawhai po po kha in hmu a,"
3,"the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:","a fiena nasatak dâm, inchikna dâm, thilmak dâm in mit ngeia in hmu kha."
4,"but Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN vawi- sûn chen hin hriet thiemna lungril dâm, hmu theina mit dâm, hriet theina nakâwr dâm a la pêk naw cheu a nih."
5,"And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxed old upon thy foot.","Thlalêrah kum sâwmli ka ṭhuoi ta cheu a, in silfênhai chu in sil chul nawh a, in kekawkhai khawm in bun chul bawk nawh a."
6,"Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.","Kei hi LALPA in Pathien ka nih ti in hriet theina dingin bei in fâk nawh a, uoin khawm, zupui khawm in dâwn nawh a."
7,"And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:","Chun, hi hmun in hung tlung hin Hesbon lal Sihon le Basan lal Og chu a mi do dingin an hung inthawk a, anni chu ei lo hneh a."
8,"and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.","An ram chu ei lâk a, Reuben mihai, Gad mihai, Manasse hnam zâtve hai hluo dingin ei pêk a."
9,"Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.","Chuongchun, in thil thaw po poa in tluongtlung pei theina dingin hi thuthlung thuhai hi pawm unla, zâwm ro."
10,"Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,","“Tuhin in rêngin in hnam ṭhuoi- tuhai, in upahai, in hotuhai, Israel mi po po,"
11,"your little ones, your wives, and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water;","in nauhairawi leh, in nuhmeihai leh, in umnaa ram dang mi in umpuihai dâm, in thing phûrtu le in tuichâwitu chenin,"
12,"that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day;","LALPA in Pathien ṭawng in- khâm le a thuthlung LALPA in Pathienin tuta nangni laia a thlunga hin in lût theina ding le,"
13,"that he may establish thee this day unto himself for a people, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he spake unto thee, and as he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.","in pi le pu Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai kuoma ṭawng a lo inkhâm ta ang le, in kuoma a lo hril ta anga a mihai a ta dinga a sukdet theina ding cheu le, in Pathien a ni theina dingin LALPA in Pathien hmaa chun in um a nih."
14,"Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,","Hi ṭawng inkhâmna thu le thuthlung thu hi in kuoma chau thlung ka ni nawh a,"
15,"but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day",vawisûna LALPA ei Pathien hmaa ngîrtuhai le tuta ei kuoma um ve nawhai kuoma khawm a nih;
16,"(for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed;","(Aigupta rama ei um dân dâm, hnam danghai nêrthlenga ei fe dân dâm, in hriet a;"
17,"and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);","anni laia an thil tirdakumhai le an milim, thing le lung dâm, tang- karuo le rângkachak dâm khawm kha in hmu bawk a)."
18,"lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;","Chuong naw chun, nangni laia pasal amanih, nuhmei amanih, sûng- kuo amanih, hnam amanih, chuong hnam pathienhai be ding chun an lungrilin tuhin LALPA ei Pathien chu nghatsanin, nangni lai thil kha le sairam zung ṭo suokna bul dâm lo um khiet rawi in tih."
19,"and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.","Chun, chuong chu a ni chun chu, hi inkhâmna thu hi a hrietin, ‘thil ṭâwla thil hnâwng sukhlum tum ti angin, lungril kâwmâwtakin um inla khawm, lungmuongna chu ka nei hrim hrim,’ tiin a lungrilin mal insâwm fâwm khat rawi a tih."
20,"Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven.","LALPA chun ngaidam dêr naw nih a, LALPA lunginsenna le a thîkna chun, chu mi chu ur a ta, hi lekhabua ṭawngsie um po po hi a chungah um a tih; LALPAIN vân hnuoia inthawk- in a hming chu thaihmang lem a tih."
21,"And Jehovah will set him apart unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.",Hi dân bua chuong ṭawngsie thuthlung ang po po hin Israel hnam po po laia inthawkin suktuma umin thil ṭha naw tiengah LALPAIN in- thangtir a tih.
22,"And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath made it sick;","“Chun, ruolthar la hung um dinghai, in hnunga in nauhai la hung um dinghai le, ram dang mi hlataka inthawka hung dinghai chun, chu rama hri le LALPAIN natna ân vawi- tirhai;"
23,"and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:","a ram pumpui chu kât le chi le kângzêu, iengkhawm chîng nawna, iengkhawm inder nawna, hlobethai khawm inder nawna, Sodom le Gomorra le Adma le Zeboiim suksiet, LALPA lunginsen le lungâwinawa a suksiet ang anga suksiet a ni an hmu hnung chun,"
24,"even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?","hnam tinin, ‘Ieng leia hi ram hi hieng anga LALPAIN a thaw am a na? Hi lunginsen inling nasatak hi iengtizie am a na?’ tîng an tih."
25,"Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,","Chuongchun, miin, ‘Aigupta rama inthawk a ṭhuoi suok laia a thuthlung, LALPA an pi le pu Pathien chu an nghatsan a,"
26,"and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given unto them:","pathien dang, an hriet naw pathienhai, amân a ruotpêk nilohai rawng chu an bâwl a, an biek lei a nih."
27,"therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;","Chuleiin, hi lekhabua chuong ṭawngsie po po intlungtirin hi ram chunga hin LALPA lung a sen a nih;"
28,"and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.","chun, lunginsen le lungâwilo le lunginsentakin an rama inthawkin a phawidawk vawng a, ram dangah a thelût a nih, tuta an um dân ang hin,’ tîng an tih."
29,"The secret things belong unto Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.","Thil inthuphai chu LALPA ei Pathien ta a na, thil suklanghai ruok chu hi dân thu po po hi ei zâwm theina dingin eini le ei thlahai ta kumkhuo ding a nih."
