1,"And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, giveth you.","“Khai le, Israel mihai, LALPA in pi le puhai Pathienin ram a pêk cheu chu dama in hluo theina dinga in pawm dinga ka închûktir hlak cheu dânhai le rorêlhai chu lo ngai ta u."
2,"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you.","LALPA in Pathien thupêk ka pêk cheu hi in pawm theina dingin, thu ka pêk cheu hi in belsa ding a ni nawh a, in suktlâwm ding a ni bawk nawh."
3,"Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-peor; for all the men that followed Baal-peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee.",Baal-peor leia LALPA thilthaw chu in mitin a hmuh a; Baal-peor betuhai po po chu LALPA in Pathien- in nangni laia inthawkin a sukbo- hmang a.
4,But ye that did cleave unto Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day.,LALPA in Pathien cheltu ta- phawthai ruok chu tu chen hin damin in la um seng a.
5,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it.","Ngai ta u, in va hluo ding rama khawm in zâwm pei dingin LALPA ka Pathienin thu a mi pêk ang takin dânhai le rorêlhai chu kân chûktir cheu a."
6,"Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.","Chuongchun, pawm unla zâwm ro; chu tak chu, hieng dân po po hi hre a, ‘Hi hnam ropuitak hi mi vartak le thil hre mi tak an ni phawt el,’ titu hnamhai mithmua chun in varna le thil hre mi in nina nîng a tih."
7,"For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh unto them, as Jehovah our God is whensoever we call upon him?",Ei ko taphawta LALPA ei Pathienin a mi hnai anga anni hnai hlak pathien nei hnam ropui tu am an um ve a?
8,"And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?","Hieng ang lâwma fel, dânhai le rorêlhai, tuta in hmaa ka zam po po ang dân nei hi hnam ropui dang tu am an um ve a?"
9,"Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children’s children;","Iengkhawm ni sienla, fîmkhur unla, nguntakin inenkawl phawt el ro, chuong naw chun, in mita in thil hmuhai chu theinghil in ta, in dam sûngin in lungrila inthawk chun bo hlau rawi a tih; in nauhai le in tuhai chen khawm inchûktir ro."
10,"the day that thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, when Jehovah said unto me, Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.","“Horeb tlânga LALPA in Pathien hmaa ngîr a, LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Mipuihai chu mi ko khâwm pêk rawh, hnuoia an um sûng poa mi ṭi dân an inchûk theina dingin an nauhai inchûktir dingin ka thuhai lo inhriettir ka tih,’ a mi ti ni khawm kha theinghil rawi in tih."
11,"And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.","Chuongchun, in hung hnai a, tlâng bula chun in hung ngîr a, vânlaizâwl tawngin tlâng chu inthim dâm, sûm dâm, inthim sâmup dâm inumtirin a kâng tah a."
12,"And Jehovah spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only ye heard a voice.","Chun, LALPA chun meia in- thawk chun a hung biek cheu a, a thu hril chu in hriet a; nisienlakhawm, hmêlhmang iengkhawm in hmu nawh a, râwl chau in hriet a nih."
13,"And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.","A thuthlung zâwm dinga thu a pêk cheu, thu sâwm pêk chu in kuom- ah a puong a, lungphêk pahniah a ziek a."
14,"And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.","Chun, chuong lai chun hluo dinga in va kaina rama in zâwm dingin dânhai le rorêlhai inchûktir dingin LALPAIN thu a mi pêk a."
15,Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire;,"“Chuleiin, fîmkhur hle ro; Horeb tlânga meia inthawka LALPA- IN a hung biek ni cheu khan hmêl- hmang iengkhawm in hmu si nawh a;"
16,"lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,","milim dâm insiem fâwmin, insukse hlau rawi in tih, a chal ang amanih, a pui ang amanih,"
17,"the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens,","hnuoia ran ang amanih, bo- ruoka vuong hlak vate thla nei ang amanih,"
18,"the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;","hnuoia invâka invâk mi ang amanih, hnuoi hnuoia tuia nga laia mi ang amani hai chu."
19,"and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Jehovah thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven.","Annawleh, vân tieng in hang nghah a, nisa dâm, thla dâm, arasi dâm, vân mi hai po po dâm in hang hmuh a, LALPA in Pathienin vân- khuphnuoia mi po po ta dinga a siempêkhai chun hîp a ti cheu a, bieng in ta, an rawng dâm bâwl khat rawi in tih."
20,"But Jehovah hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as at this day.","LALPA chun a mihai, a ro ni dinga thîr rawtuinaa inthawk, Aigupta rama inthawk chun a ṭhuoi suok lem cheu a ni kha, tuta in ni ang hin."
21,"Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:","Chuong chau khawm chu ni loin, nangni leiin LALPA chu ka chungah a lunginsen a, Jordan vadung chu ka kân nawh a, in hluo dinga ram ṭhatak LALPA in Pathienin a pêk cheua chun ka lût nawna dingin ân khâm bawk a."
22,"but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.","Kei chu hi rama hi thi ding ka na, Jordan vadung chu ka kai naw ding a nih; nangni ruok chu kai in ta, chu ram ṭhatak chu hluong in tih."
23,"Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in the form of anything which Jehovah thy God hath forbidden thee.","Fimkhur hle ro, chuong naw chun, LALPA in Pathien thuthlung in kuoma a thlung chu theinghil rawi in ta, LALPA in Pathienin ieng angpui khawma siem a phal naw milimhai dâm insiem fâwm pal rawi in tih."
24,"For Jehovah thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.","LALPA in Pathien chu kâng bohmang mei, thîkthusetak Pathien a ni sih a."
25,"When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, to provoke him to anger;","“Tu le tehai in hung nei a, chu rama sâwt rei in um hnunga, in insukkhawhlo a, ieng amanih angpui dâma milim siem fâwmhai in indin a, a lung suksen dinga LALPA in Pathien mithmua thil ṭha naw in thaw vai chun;"
26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.","Jordan kâna in va hluo ding rama inthawk chun bohmang vak el in tih, ti in chungchâng thua a mi hrietpuitu dingin tuhin hnuoi le vân ka fiel a nih, chêng sâwt naw ti niu a, bohmang vawng el in tih."
27,"And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah shall lead you away.","LALPA chun hnam tin lai chun sukdar a ti cheu a, LALPAIN ân fe hmangtirna cheu hnamhai lai chun tlâwmte chauin um in tih."
28,"And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.","Chutaka chun pathien, thing le lunga mihriem isiem, hmu thei hlei lo, fa thei hlei lo, rim khawm hre thei hlei lohai chu bieng in ta."
29,"But from thence ye shall seek Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt find him, when thou searchest after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.","Nisienlakhawm, chutaka khawm chun LALPA in Pathien chu in zawng a, in lungril po po le in lungvar po poa in zawng chun hmu nâwk in tih."
30,"When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to Jehovah thy God, and hearken unto his voice:","Rinuma in uma, in chunga chuong thilhai po po chu a hung tlung pha chun a tâwp a tâwpa chun LALPA in Pathien tieng chu ngha kîr nâwk in ta, a thu chu pawm tâng in tih."
31,"for Jehovah thy God is a merciful God; he will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.","LALPA in Pathien chu zângai theitak Pathien a ni sih a; thlâthlam naw ni cheu a, sukbohmang naw bawk a ti cheu a, in pi le puhai kuoma inkhâma a thutiem chu theinghil naw bawk a tih."
32,"For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?","“In pieng hma, kha hma tieng kha hang ngaituo unla, leihnuoia Pathienin mihriem a siema inthawk vânkhuphnuoia hieng anga thil ropui hi a um hlakin, hriet khawm a ni hrim hlak am chu?"
33,"Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?","Meia inthawka thu hung hril a, in hriet a, in la hring ta rawpna Pathien râwl mîn an hriet hlakin,"
34,"Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?","hnam dang laia inthawka fiena dâm, inchikna dâm, thilmak dâm, indona dâm, kut hrâttak dâm, bân phar dâm, thil râpthlâkhaia LALPA in Pathienin in mithmua Aigupta rama a thaw hlak ang po poa hnam ṭhuoi suok ngam pathien an um hlak am chu?"
35,"Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that Jehovah he is God; there is none else besides him.",LALPA chu Pathien a nih ti in hriet theina dingin in kuoma suklang a na; ama naw chu a dang hrim an um nawh.
36,"Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.","Ân chûktir theina ding cheuin vâna inthawkin a râwl a hung inhriettir cheu a, hnuoi chunga hin a meipui chu ân hmutir cheu a, meia inthawkin a thu chu in lo hriet a."
37,"And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;","In pi le puhai chu a hmangai leiin an hnungah an thlahai chu a thlang cheu a, ama ṭhangin a thil- thawtheina ropuitakin Aigupta rama inthawk chun a ṭhuoi suok cheu a;"
38,"to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as at this day.",hnam dang nangni nêka ropui le thilthawthei lem hnawt suokpêk cheua an ram chu hluo dinga ân lûttir theina ding cheuin; tuta in ni ang tak hin.
39,"Know therefore this day, and lay it to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else.","Chuleiin, tuhin in lungrilah vawng unla, chungtieng vâna le hnuoitieng leihnuoia hin LALPA chu Pathien a nih ti hre ro; a dang hrim an um nawh."
40,"And thou shalt keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days in the land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, for ever.","Kumkhuoa dinga LALPA in Pathienin a pêk cheu rama chun nangni le in thlahai ta dinga ṭha le in chêng sâwt theina dinga thuruothai le thupêkhai, tuta ka pêk cheu hi in zâwm ding a nih,” ti hi."
41,Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;,"Chun, Mosie chun suotieng pangah khuo pathum Jordan râlah a ruot a,"
42,"that the manslayer might flee thither, that slayeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:","tuolthattu a tuolbâwmhai, kha hma khawma theida chuong lo that paltu tlânna dingin; chuong khuo, a ienga khawm a tlân chun him a tih."
43,"namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.","Chuonghai chu Reubenhai puola thlalêra tlâng zâwla Bezer dâm, Gad mihai puola Gileada Ramoth dâm, Manasse mihai puola Basana Golan dâm an nih."
44,And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:,Hi hi Mosien Israel thlahai dân a pêk chu a nih;
45,"these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,","Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok laia Mosien Israel thlahai kuoma inhriettirna dâm, dân dâm, rorêl dâm a hril chu a nih;"
46,"beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt.","Jordan râla Mosie le Israel thlahaiin Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok laia an that, Hesbona um Ammon mihai lal Sihon rama Beth-peor zâwn ruoma khan:"
47,"And they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;","A ram le Basan lal Og ram, nisa suokna tienga Amor mihai lal pahni ram chu an hluo a,"
48,"from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even unto mount Sion (the same is Hermon),",Arnon ruom sîra Ariera in- thawka Sion tlâng (Hermon an ti bawk) chen le
49,"and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.","Jordan râl saktieng pang Araba po po, Pisga pangpêr hnuoia Araba tuisuoriet chenin."
