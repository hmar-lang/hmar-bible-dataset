1,"All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers.","“Dama in um a, in hung pung pei a, pêk ding cheua in pi le puhai kuoma LALPAIN ṭawng ân khamna ram chu in va hluo theina dingin thupêk vawisûna ka pêk cheu hi zâwm dingin in fîmkhur ding a nih."
2,"And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or not.","Chun, a thupêkhai chu in zâwm ding le ding naw, in lungril hrietna dinga fiena ding le inngaitlâwmtir ding cheua thlalêra kum sâwmli a ṭhuoina cheu lampuihai po po kha hre zing ro."
3,"And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live.","Mihriem hi bei chauin an hring nawh a, LALPA bâua thu tin suokin a nih ti ân hriettir theina ding cheuin a sukhnuoi cheu a, in ṭâm dâm a phal a, in hriet ngai lo, in pi le puhai khawma an hriet ngai lo manna chun a châwm cheu a."
4,"Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.","Hieng kum sâwmli sûng hin in silfên chu in sil chulin in hâk chul nawh a, in kehai khawm ân vûng nawh a."
5,"And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so Jehovah thy God chasteneth thee.",Miin a nau a thunun hlak angin LALPA in Pathien chun a thunun hlak cheu a nih ti hi in lungrilin hre rân ro.
6,"And thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.","Chuleiin, a lampui hraw ding le ama chu ṭi dingin LALPA in Pathien thupêkhai chu in zâwm ding a nih."
7,"For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;","LALPA in Pathien chun ruom le tlânga inthawka hung suok vadung tui dâm, tuikhur le tui inthûktak umna ram,"
8,"a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey;","bu dâm, buṭei dâm, grêp dâm, theichang dâm, theibufai dâm, umna ram, hriek nei oliv le khuoizu umna ram,"
9,"a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig copper.","iengkhawm in tlâksam nawna ding, tlasam loa bei in fâkna ding ram, a lunghai chu thîr, a tlânghai chu dârsen cho suok theina ram, ram ṭhataka chun a ṭhuoi lût ding cheu a ni sih a."
10,"And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.","In fâka in tlai hle pha chun, ram ṭhatak a pêk cheu lei chun LALPA in Pathien chu inpâk in tih."
11,"Beware lest thou forget Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:","“A thupêkhai, a thuruothai, a rorêlhai, vawisûna ka pêk cheu hi zâwm loin LALPA in Pathien chu theinghil khat rawi in tih, fîmkhur ro;"
12,"lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;","chuong naw chun, in fâk a, in tlai a, in ṭhatak dâm in bâwl a, in hluo pha le,"
13,"and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;","in ran ruolhai, in berâm ruolhai a hung pung a, in tangka dâm, in rângkachak dâm a hung pung a, in thil neihai po po chu a hung pung pha chun,"
14,"then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;","in lungril hung chapo a ta, suoka inthawka Aigupta rama in- thawka ṭhuoi suoktu cheu LALPA in Pathien theinghil el in ti kha."
15,"who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;","Ama chun thlalêr lientak le rapthlâktak, rûl chukna chi le ainu- vêt umna, tui um nawna, ram ṭâwlah a ṭhuoi thleng cheu a; meitâwklung lungpuia inthawk chun tui a suksuokpêk cheu a,"
16,"who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end:","in pi le puhai hriet ngailo man- na chun a châwm cheu a, tuta hnunga in hung ṭhat theina dingin a sukhnuoi cheu a, a fie theina ding cheuin."
17,"and lest thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.","Chun, ‘hieng ei sum le paihai hi eini hrâtna le ei kutsuok a nih,’ ti lungril rawi in tih, fîmkhur bawk ro."
18,"But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day.","Tuta a nghet anga in pi le puhai kuoma inkhâmna thu a thlung chu a suknghetna dingin LALPA in Pathien chu hre zing ro, sum le pai themsuok theina petu cheu chu ama chu a ni lem a nih."
19,"And it shall be, if thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.","LALPA in Pathien chu in theinghil a, Pathien danghai in zui a, a rawng dâm in bâwl a, in biek hlau chun, bohmang ngei ngei in tih ti vawisûn hin kân hriettir cheu."
20,"As the nations that Jehovah maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God.","In hmaa hnam danghai a sukbo- hmang angin nangni khawm bo- hmang in tih, LALPA in Pathien râwl chu ngai nuom lo in ni ding a ni leiin."
