1,"And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them.","Chun, Mosien Israelhai po po chu a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, “Aw Israel mihai, in inchûka in pawm dinga dânhai, thuruothai, in na hrieta vawisûna ka hril hi lo ngai ro."
2,Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.,LALPA ei Pathienin Horeba chun ei kuomah thu a thlung a.
3,"Jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.","LALPA chun hi thu hi ei pi le puhai kuoma khan a thlung nawh a, einirawi, tu chena dama la um po pohai kuoma ngei hin a nih, a thlung lem chu."
4,Jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,"LALPA chun tlângah meia in- thawkin inhmatuoin a biek cheu a,"
5,"(I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to show you the word of Jehovah: for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the mount), saying,","(chuonglai chun LALPA thu khîkhmu ding cheuin LALPA le in inkârah kei ka ngîr a; mei lei chun in ṭi sih a, tlânga khawm chun in hang fe nawh a.)"
6,"I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.","“Kei hi LALPA i Pathien, Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu che ka nih,."
7,Thou shalt have no other gods before me.,“Keima naw chu Pathien dang hrim hrim i nei ding a ni nawh.
8,"Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:","“Milim siem fâwm, chungtieng vâna mi amanih, hnuoitieng leihnuoia mi amanih, hnuoi hnuoitienga tuia mi amanih, a ieng angpui khawm i ta dingin i siem ding a ni nawh."
9,"thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;","Chuong chu chibai i bûk ding a ni nawh a, an rawng i bâwl ding a ni bawk nawh. Kei LALPA i Pathien hi Pathien thîkthusie, pahai khawhlona leia nauhai hrem hlak, a mi theidatuhai chu suon thumna le suon lina chena hrem hlak,"
10,and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.,mi hmangaia ka thupêkhai pawmtu sâng tamtakhai chunga ruok chu lunginsietna inlangtir hlak ka ni hi.
11,Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain: for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.,“LALPA i Pathien hming chu i sâm mei mei ding a ni nawh. LALPA chun thiemlo inchangtir loin ân suo âwm si nawh a.
12,"Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee.",“LALPA i Pathienin thu a pêk ang chein châwlni chu inthieng zing dingin inser rawh.
13,"Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;","Ni ruk sûng chun sin thâwng i ta, i sin po po chu i thaw ding a nih."
14,"but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.","A ni sari ni ruok chu LALPA i Pathien ta dinga châwlni a nih; chu ni chun sin hrim hrim i thaw ding a ni nawh, nangma khawma, i naupa khawma, i naunu khawma, i suokpa khawma, i suoknu khawma, i bâwng- chal khawm, i sabengtung khawm, i ran a ieng khawma; i ina ram dang mihai khawmin; nangma ang bawka i suokpahai, i suoknuhai khawm an châwl theina dingin."
15,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Jehovah thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.","Nang khawm Aigupta rama khan suok i ni tah a, LALPA i Pathienin chutaka inthawk chu kut hrâttak le bân phara a ṭhuoi suok che i nih ti hre zing rawh; chu lei chun a nih, LALPA i Pathienin châwlni inser dinga thu a pêk che chu."
16,"Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee; that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.","“LALPA i Pathienin thu a pêk che angin i nu le i pa chawimawi rawh; chuongchun, LALPAIN ram a pêka che hin tluongtlung i ta, i dam sâwt ding a nih."
17,Thou shalt not kill.,“Tuol i that ding a ni nawh.
18,Neither shalt thou commit adultery.,“I uire ding a ni nawh.
19,Neither shalt thou steal.,“În rûk ding a ni nawh.
20,Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.,“I vênghai chungah hrietpuina inkhêl i hril ding a ni nawh.
21,"Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor’s house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or anything that is thy neighbor’s.","“I vênghai nuhmei chu în hnar ding a ni nawh a, i vênghai in ama- nih, a lo amanih, a suokpa amanih, a suoknu amanih, a bâwngchal ama- nih, a sabengtung amanih, i vênghai thil a ieng iengkhawm în hnar ding a ni nawh,” tiin."
22,"These words Jehovah spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me.","“Hieng thuhai hi, tlânga mei dâm, inthim dâm, inthim sâmup dâma inthawkin LALPAIN rawl in- ringtakin in rênga pungkhâwmhai kuomah a hril a, a belsa nâwk chuong ta nawh a. Chuong chu lungphêk pahniah a ziek a, a mi pêk a."
23,"And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;","“Chun, tlâng chu a kâng laia, inthima inthawka râwl chu in hang hriet chun, in mi hung hnai a, in hnam lusahai po po le in upahai le chun;"
24,"and ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God hath showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth.","‘Ngai ta, LALPA ei Pathien chun kan kuomah a ropuizie le a lienzie ân langtir a, meia inthawka a râwl chu kan hriet a; Pathienin mi a biek khawma thina a ni chuong nawzie chu vawisûn hin kan lo hriet tah a."
25,"Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more, then we shall die.","Chuleiin, ieng dingin am thîng kan ta? Hi mei nasatak hin a mi kâng hmang el naw ding am a nih? LALPA ei Pathien râwl chu kan hriet nâwk chun thi el kan tih."
26,"For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?",Meia inthawka Pathien hring râwl kan hriet anga hre vea dam si taksa put hai po po lai tu am a um a?
27,"Go thou near, and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that Jehovah our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.","Nangin va hnai la, LALPA ei Pathienin a hril ding po po chu nang- in kan kuomah hril i ta; chuongchun, lo ngai kan ta kan zâwm ding annâwm,’ in tih a."
28,"And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.","Chun, in mi biek laia in thu hril chu LALPAIN a lo hriet a, ‘Hieng mipuihai hin i kuoma thu an hril chu ka lo hriet a; an thu hril po po chu an hril dik ngawt el."
29,"Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!","Chuong ang lungril chu put hlak hai sien chu aw, mi ṭîng an ta, ka thupêkhai chu zâwm rawp an ta, anni le an nauhai khawm kumkhaw- tluongin an tluongtlung hle ding bah!"
30,"Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.","Fe la, an kuomah, In puon inahai va fe phawt ro, ti rawh."
31,"But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.","Nang ruok chu ka kâwlah ngir la, hluo dinga ram ka pêka an pawm dinga i închûktir ding thupêk po po dâm, thuruothai dâm, rorêlhai dâm chu hril ka ti che,’ a tih a."
32,Ye shall observe to do therefore as Jehovah your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.,"Chuleiin, LALPA in Pathienin thu a pêk cheu anga thaw dingin fîmkhur ro; changtienga manih, vawitienga manih in pêt ding a ni nawh."
33,"Ye shall walk in all the way which Jehovah your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.","In va hluo ding rama in uma, in ta dinga ṭhatna ding le in chêng sâwt theina dingin LALPA in Pathienin thu a pêk cheu lampui chu in hraw tluonsuok ding a nih."
