1,"These are the statutes and the ordinances which ye shall observe to do in the land which Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.","“LALPA in pi le puhai Pathien- in a pêk cheu ram in hluo a, hnuoia in um sûnga fîmkhurtaka in zâwm ding thuruothai, rorêl dânhai chu hieng hi a nih."
2,"Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye shall dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:","In va hluo ding ram hnamhaiin tlâng lienhai, tlâng chînhai, thing hring tin hnuoi dâma an pathienhai rawng an bâwlna hmun po pohai chu in suksiet vawng ding a nih."
3,"and ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.","An mâichâmhai sukchim in ta, an lungphunhai suknâwi vawng in ta, an Asera dâm chu in raw ding a nih; an pathien lim siem fâwmhai chu phûrpêk in ta, chutaka an hming chu in thaihmang ding a nih."
4,Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God.,Chuong ang chun LALPA in Pathien chunga chu in thaw ding a ni nawh.
5,"But unto the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;","LALPA in Pathienin in hnam po po laia a hming umna ding hmun a la ruot ding chu zawng lem in ta, chutaka chun in fe ding a nih."
6,"and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock:","Chutaka chun in pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai, in inthâwinahai, in sâwma pakhat dâm, in thên thilin- hlânhai dâm, in thutiem dâm, in nuomthua thilinhlânhai dâm, in ran ruol le in berâm ruol laia pieng hmasa takhai in hung lâk ding a nih."
7,"and there ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.","Chutaka chu, LALPA in Pathien hmaa chun fâng in ta, in kut rasuok LALPAIN mal a sâwmna cheua chun hlimtakin in um ding a nih, in sungkuoin."
8,"Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;",“Mi tinin mâni ṭha ti zâwng ang ela tuta ei thaw ang hin in thaw ding a ni nawh;
9,"for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.",LALPA in Pathienin a pêk cheu ram le châwlna chu in la tlung hri si nawh a.
10,"But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;","Jordan vadung in kai a, LALPA in Pathienin ân hluotir ding cheuah in um a, himtaka in um theina dinga in vêla hmêlmahai po poa inthawka ân châwltir pha cheu ruok chun,"
11,"then it shall come to pass that to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto Jehovah.","LALPA in Pathienin a hming inumtirna ding a ruot ding hmuna hung lâk dinga ka ti po po chutaka chun in hung lâk ding a nih, in pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai, in sâwma pakhat dâm, in thên thilin- hlânhai, LALPA kuoma thutiema in tiem ṭha ṭhahai le chun."
12,"And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.","LALPA in Pathien hmaa chun hlimtakin um in ta, nangni le in naupasalhai le, in naunuhmeihai leh, in suokpahai leh, in suoknuhai leh in ina um Levi mihai leh, anni chun nangni lai chanvo le ram nei ve nghâl lohai."
13,Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;,“Hmun in hmuna taphawtah in pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai inhlân el lo dingin fîmkhur ro khai.
14,"but in the place which Jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.",In hnamhai laia LALPAIN a la ruot ding hmuna chun in pumraw- hmang thilinhlânhai chu inhlân lem in ta; chutaka chun thu ka pêk cheu po po chu in thaw ding a nih.
15,"Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.","Amiruokchu, LALPA in Pa- thienin malsâwmna ân dawngtir cheu ang peiin in hringnain a châk ang ang chu in in sengah that in ta, a sa chu fa thei in tih; ân thienghai le ân thiengnawhai khawm a, sangai dâm, sakhi dâm hi chu fa thei an tih."
16,Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.,A thisen ruok chu in fâk ding a ni nawh; tui angin hnuoiah in bunthlâk ding a nih.
17,"Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of thy hand;","In ina chun sâwma pakhat, in bu dâm, in uoin dâm, in hriek dâm le in ran ruol le berâm ruol laia pieng hmasa takhai, in thutiema mi dâm, in nuomthua thilinhlânhai dâm, in thên thilinhlânhai chu fa thei naw ti niu a."
18,"but thou shalt eat them before Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.","LALPA in Pathienin hmun a la ruot dingah, LALPA in Pathien hmaah in fâk lem ding a nih, nangni le in naupasalhai le in naunuhmeihai le in suokpahai, in suoknuhai, in ina um Levi mihai leh; LALPA in Pathien hmaah in kut rasuok taphawtah hlimtakin in um ding a nih."
19,Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest in thy land.,In rama in um sûng po chu Levi mihai chu ngaitha lo dingin fîmkhur ro.
20,"When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul.","“LALPA in Pathienin a tiem cheu anga in ram a suklien a, in hringnain sa a fâk châk leia, ‘Sa fâng ka tih,’ in ti pha chun, in hringnain a châk zâwng ang ang sa fa thei in tih."
21,"If the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to put his name there, be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which Jehovah hath given thee, as I have commanded thee; and thou mayest eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul.","LALPA in Pathienin a hming umna ding a la ruot ding chu in hlat taluo chun thu ka pêk cheu ang khan LALPAIN a pêk cheu in ran ruol le in berâm ruol laia mi that in ta, in hringnain a châk ang zâwng chu in inah in fâk ding a nih."
22,"Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike.","Sangai hai, sakhi hai in fâk ang elin fâng in ta, ân thienghai le ân thiengnawhai khawma angkhat zingin fâng in tih."
23,Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh.,"Thisen ruok chu fa lo dingin fîmkhur ro, thisen chu hringna a na, hringna pumin sa chu in fâk ding a ni nawh."
24,Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.,"In fâk dêr ding a ni nawh, tui angin hnuoiah in bunthlâk el ding a nih."
25,"Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, LALPA mithmuah thil dik in thaw hin nangni le in hnunga in nauhai ta dingin a la ṭha ding annawm."
26,"Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which Jehovah shall choose;","In thil inthienghai le in thu- tiema mi chau chawi unla, LALPAIN hmun a la ruot dinga chun fe ro."
27,"and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and thou shalt eat the flesh.","Chun, LALPA in Pathien mâichâmah in pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu, a sa le a thisen inhlân in ta, chun in inthâwinahai thisen chu LALPA in Pathien mâichâma chun bun suok in ta, a sa chu fâng in tih."
28,"Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.","Hieng thu ka pêk po po cheu hi nguntakin ngaituo ro; chuongchun, LALPA in Pathien mithmua thil ṭha le thil dik in thaw hin, in ta ding le in hnunga in nauhai ta dingin kumkhawtluonga dingin a la ṭha ding a nih."
29,"When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them, and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land;","“LALPA in Pathienin va hne ding hnamhai a sukbohmangpêk cheu a, an ram in hluo a, in khawsak pha chun;"
30,"take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.","sukbohmanga an umna anga khan in âwk ve nawna dingin fîmkhur ro, ‘Hieng hnamhai hin ieng- tin am an pathienhai rawng an bâwl a, an thaw angin eini khawm thaw vêng ei tiu,’ tiin, an pathien chungchâng thuhai dâm chu dâwp vêl naw ro."
31,"Thou shalt not do so unto Jehovah thy God: for every abomination to Jehovah, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.","Chuong ang chun LALPA in Pathien chungah in thaw ding a ni nawh; an pathien chunga chun LALPA ngaia thil tirdakum tinrêng a theida takhai chu an thaw hlak a, an naupasalhai, an naunuhmeihai ngei khawm an pathien ta dingin an raw hlak a nih."
32,"What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.","“Thaw dinga thu ka pêk ta- phawt cheu chu in thaw ding a na, in belsa ding a ni nawh a, in suktlâwm ding a ni bawk nawh."
