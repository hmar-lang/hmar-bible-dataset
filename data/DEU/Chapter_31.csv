1,And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.,"Chun, Mosien Israel mi po pohai kuomah hieng thu hi a va hril a."
2,"And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.","An kuomah a hril a, “Tuhin chu kum za le sâwmhni ka lo ni tah a; ka suok invâk thei ta nawh a; chun, LALPAIN, ‘Hi Jordan vadung hi kai naw ti ni’ a mi tih a."
3,"Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee; he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.","LALPA in Pathien chun in hma ṭhuoi a ta, hieng hnamhai hi sukbo- pêk a ti cheu a, an ram chu hluong in tih; chun, LALPAIN a lo hril ta angin Josua chun in hma ṭhuoi a tih."
4,"And Jehovah will do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom he destroyed.","LALPAIN Amor mihai lal hai, Sihon le Og le an ram a sukbohmang laia an chunga a thaw ang khan an chungah thâwng a tih."
5,"And Jehovah will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you.","LALPAIN anni chu inhlân a ti cheu a, thu ka ipêk cheu thupêkhai po po ang khan an chungah in thaw ding a nih."
6,"Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for Jehovah thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.","Hrâttak le huoitakin um unla, ṭi naw ro, anni chu ṭi bawk naw ro; in kuoma fe ve chu LALPA in Pathien a ni sih a; inhlâwsamtir naw ni cheu, mâk khawm mâksan naw tawp a ti cheu,” tiin."
7,"And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.","Chun, Mosie chun Josua chu a ko a, Israel mi po pohai mithmuah a kuomah, “Hrâttak le huoitakin um rawh, hieng mihai kuoma hin an pi le puhai LALPAIN inkhâma pêk a lo tiem ta rama chun i fe ve ding a nih, anni hi în hluotir ding a nih."
8,"And Jehovah, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.","I hmaṭhuoitu chu LALPA nîng a ta, i kuomah um pei a tih, inhlâw- samtir naw ni che a, mâk khawm mâksan naw tawp a ti che; ṭi naw la, zâm bawk naw rawh,” a tih a."
9,"And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and unto all the elders of Israel.","Chun, Mosie chun chu dân chu a ziek a, LALPA thuthlung bâwm zâwntu Levi naupa, thiempuhai le Israel upahai po po chu a pêk a."
10,"And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,","Chuongchun, Mosie chun, “Kum sari kum, ngaidam kum taphawta bâwkte ruoiṭhea,"
11,"when all Israel is come to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.",hmun a la ruot dinga Israel mi po po LALPA in Pathien hmaa an hung inlang pha hi dân hi Israel mi po po hrietah in tiem ding a nih.
12,"Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy sojourner that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;","Mipuihai, nuhmei, pasal, in nau le tehai, in umpui ram dang mihai, anni chun an ngai a, an inchûk a, LALPA an Pathien chu an ṭi a, hi dân thu po po hi fîmkhurtaka an zâwm theina dingin;"
13,"and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Jehovah your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.","le an nauhai la hrelohai khawma an hriet a, Jordan vadung kaia in va hluo ding rama in um sûng po poa LALPA in Pathien ṭi an inchûk theina dingin ko khâwm hlak ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
14,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Ngai ta, i thi hun a hung hnai tah a; Josua chu ko la, inbiekna puon ina chun vân lang ro, thu ka pêk ding a nih,” a ta. Mosie le Josua chu an feh a; inbiekna puon ina chun an vân lang a."
15,And Jehovah appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.,"LALPA chu puon ina chun sûm- ngîrin a hung inlâr a; chun, sûmngîr chu puon in kawtkhâr lu chunga chun a ngîr a."
16,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, i pi le puhai kuomah i ininnghil ding a ni tah a, hieng mihai hi tho an ta, an va umna dinghai laia chu rama pathienhai kuoma chun uirêng an ta, mi nghatsan an ta, ka thuthlung an kuoma ka thlung chu bâwsieng an ta."
17,"Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?","Chu pha chun an chungah ka lung chawk a ta, nghatsan ka ta, inbîksan ka tih, bohmang an ta, thil ṭha naw le lunginzîngna tamtak an chungah tlung a tih; chuongchun, chu ni chun, ‘Ei Pathien eini lai a um naw leiin hieng thil ṭha naw ei chungah a hung tlung a ni naw am a nih?’ tîng an tih,"
18,"And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.",pathien dang tieng nghaa thil ṭha naw an thawhai po po lei chun an kuoma inthawkin kân thup ngei ngei ding a nih.
19,"Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.","Chuleiin, hla hi in ta dingin ziek la, Israel thlahai chu inchûktir rawh; Israel thlahai chungchâng thuah hi hla hi a mi hrietpuitu a ni theina dingin invawntir rawh."
20,"For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.","An pi le puhai kuoma inkhâma ka tiem, nênetui le khuoizua luong rama chun ka ṭhuoi a, fa le dâwna an um a, an tlaia an hung thâu pha meu chun pathien danghai kuom tieng nghâng an ta, an rawnghai bâwl an ta, mi hmusit an ta, ka thuthlunghai bâwsieng an tih."
21,"And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.","Thil ṭha naw le lunginzîngna tamtak an chunga a hung tlung pha chun, hi hla hi ân hrietsuoktirtu nîng a tih; (an thlahai baua inthawkin theinghil thei a ni âwm si nawh a); tuta kân khâmna rama ka ṭhuoi hma hrim khawmin an insuongtuo vêl dan chu ka hrietsa zing a nih,” a tih a."
22,"So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun chu hla chu, chu ni le le chun a ziek a, Israel thlahai chu ân chûktir a,"
23,"And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.","LALPA chun, Nun naupa, Josua chu ân fui a, “Seltak le huoitakin um rawh khai, Israel thlahai chu an kuomah inkhâma ka tiem rama chun i ṭhuoi lût ding a nih; chun, i kuomah um pei ka tih,” a tih a."
24,"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,","Mosien hieng dân thuhai hi lekhabua a ziek zo a, zo hieu a hung ni chun,"
25,"that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,","thuthlung bâwm zâwntu Levi mihai chu Mosie chun thu a pêk a,"
26,"Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.","“Hi dân bu hi la unla, in chung- châng thua hretu dingin LALPA in Pathien thuthlung bâwm sîrah sie ro."
27,"For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah; and how much more after my death?","Hel in chîngzie dâm, in kâwmawzie dâm ka hriet a nih; ngai ta u, tuta ka la dampui lai cheu hmana LALPA chungah in hel hlak a; ka thi hnunga lem chu iengtin takin am a nasa ding chu aw!"
28,"Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.","An na hrietah hieng thu hi ka hril a, an chungchâng thua hretu dingin vân le hnuoi ka sâl theina dingin in hnam ṭhuoituhai po po, in hotuhai mi ko khâwmpêk ro."
29,"For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.","Ka thi hnung chun nasatakin insuksieng in ta, ka thupêk cheu lampuia inthawk hin pêthmang in tih ti ka hriet zing a nih; chun, a tâwpa lem chu thil ṭha nawin tlâkbuok a ti cheu a; in kut thilthawa suklungsen dinga LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw in thaw ding leiin,” tiin."
30,"And Moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Israelhai pungkhâwm po po hrieta chun hi hla hi a tâwp chenin a hril vawng a:"
