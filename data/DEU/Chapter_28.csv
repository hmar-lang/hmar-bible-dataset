61,"Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will Jehovah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.","Hi dân lekhabua chuonglo, nat- na le hri tinrêng khawm in bohmang hmakhat chun LALPAIN in chungah inlêngtir a tih."
62,"And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God.","Vâna arasi zât hiel ni hlak kha tlâwmte bak hung ni tâng in ta, LALPA in Pathien râwl chu in zâwm naw leiin."
63,"And it shall come to pass, that, as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it.","A thawṭha ding cheu le a sukpung ding cheua LALPA chu a thafân ang khan a sukbohmang ding cheu le a sukse ding cheuin LALPA chu thafân a ta, in va hluo ding in va lûtna rama inthawk chun sawn hmang nîng in tih."
64,"And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone.","“Chun, LALPA chun kâwlkila inthawka kâwlkil khing tieng chenin chi tin laia chun sukdar a ti cheu a, chutaka chun thing le lunga siem, in pi le puhai chena in hriet ngai naw pathien dang rawng bâwl in tih."
65,"And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but Jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul;","Chuong hnamhaia inthawk chun sâwldamna hrim hrim hmu naw ti niu a, in ke ta dingin châwlna hrim hrim um naw bawk a tih; chutaka chun LALPAIN inthinna lungril dâm, mit châuna dâm, nguina lungril dâm pe lem a ti cheu a,"

67,"In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.","Zîngtieng chun, ‘Zântieng ni ta sien aw,’ tîng in ta, zântieng chun, ‘Zîngtieng ni ta sien aw,’ tîng in tih; thil ṭium in lungrilin a ṭi ding le in mita in thil hmu ding lei chun."
68,"And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.","‘Hmu nâwk ta naw ti niu,’ in kuoma ka ti lampuia chun lawngin Aigupta ramah LALPAIN ṭhuoi nâwk a ti cheu; chun, chutaka chun in hmêlmahai suokpa ni ding dâmin, suoknu ni ding dâmin inzawr in ta, tukhawmin an dit naw ding cheu a nih,” tiin."
