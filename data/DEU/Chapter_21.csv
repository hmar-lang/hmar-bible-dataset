1,"If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;","“LALPA in Pathienin hluo dinga a pêk cheu rama hin khawhnâwmah mî sukhlumin lo um sienla, a sukhlumtu hriet ni si naw sienla,"
2,"then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:","in upahai le in rorêltuhai chu hung an ta, an sukhlumna khuoa inthawk chun inkhîng an ta;"
3,"and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;","chun, a ruong umnaa inthawka khaw hnai tak, chu khaw upahai chun bâwng ruol laia bâwngla, la sawr lo, rîngkawl la bât lo kei an tih;"
4,"and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.","chu khaw upahai chun bâwngla, chu tui luongna, hnuoi lân letna ngai- lo le iengkhawm la chîng ngai nawna ruomah kei thlâng an ta, ruoma chun bâwngla rîng chu tan an tih."
5,"And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.","Levi naupa thiempuhaiin hung pan an ta, anni chu LALPA in Pathienin a rawngbâwltu le LALPA hminga malsâwmtuhai dinga a ruot an ni sih a; thubuoi le invuok thu chu an rêl ang ang nîng a tih."
6,"And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;","Ruong hnai tak khaw upahai po po chun ruoma an that bâwngla rîng an tan chunga chun an kut sâwp an ta, hieng hin an ti ding a nih;"
7,"and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.","‘Kan kutin thisen hi ân suo nawh a, kan mitin a suok lai a hmu bawk nawh."
8,"Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.","Aw LALPA, în tlan suok i mi Israelhai hi ngaidam la, i mi Israelhai lai hin pawitâwk lo thisen suokna hi a um phal naw la, thisen thua chun ngaidam lem rawh,’ tiin."
9,"So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.",Chuong ang chun LALPA mit- hmua thil ṭha thawin pawitâwk lo thisen suokna chu in sukkieng ding a nih.
10,"When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,","“In hmêlmahai rûn dinga in fe suok a, LALPA in Pathienin in kutah a pêk cheu a, sala in ṭhuoi a,"
11,"and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;","sal laia nuhmei hmêl ṭhatak, in mi dit zâwngtak, nuhmei dinga in mi dit zâwngtak in hmu chun,"
12,"then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;","in inah ṭhuoi in ta, an lu vâwng an ta, an tin tan an tih."
13,"and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.","An sal zakuo chu hlîp an ta, in inah um an ta, thla khat zet an nu le pa sûn an ta, chu hnunga chun inpâwlpui tâng in tih, an pasal nîng in ta, in nuhmei ni tâng an tih."
14,"And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.","Chun, in lung a awi naw chun an nuomna naah an fe in phal ding a nih, sum le paiah in zawr dêr ding a ni nawh, sal cheiin in chei ding khawm a ni bawk nawh, in suk- hmingse ta sih a."
15,"If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;","“Miin nuhmei pahni nei ang sienla, pakhat chu ditin pakhat dang chu theida sienla, a idit le a itheida chun nau neipêk ve ve hai sienla, chun, naupasal upa tak chu a ithei- danu nau chu ni ta sienla,"
16,"then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born:","a ro nei chu a naupasalhai ân khâwmtir pha chun a idittak naupa chu a naupasal upa a itheidanu naupa nêka kha upa lema siem el ding a ni nawh a,"
17,"but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.","a itheidanu nau, a nau upa tak, a nei po poah chan hni huia a siem ding a nih, a hrâtna bul a na, a nau lutir nina chu ama chanpuol a nih."
18,"If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;","“Miin naupasal kâwmâwtak, hel hmangtak el nei sienla, a nu le pa thu awi loin, an thununna pawm naw sienla,"
19,"then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;","a nu le pa chun kei an ta, an khaw upahai kuomah an khaw kul kawtkhâr bulah ṭhuoi an tih."
20,"and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.","An khaw upahai kuoma chun, ‘Hi kan naupa hi kâwmâwtak le hel hmangtak a na, kan thu khawm a awi nuom nawh a, insukthâm nuom mi le inrui hmang mi a na,’ an ti ding a nih."
21,"And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.","Chuongchun, khuoa mi po po chun lungin an dênghlum ding a nih; chuong ang chun nangni laia inthawk chun thil ṭha naw chu in sukbo ding a nih; chun, Israel mi po po chun hrieng an ta, ṭîng an tih."
22,"And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;","“Chun, miin thina khawp suol a thawh a, sukhlum a nih a, thing lêra in khai chun,"
23,"his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.","a ruong chu thinga chun zânkhawvârin a um ding a ni nawh a, chu ni le le chun in phûm ding a nih; thinga khai taphawt chu Pathien ṭawngsephur an ni sih a, LALPA in Pathienin hluo dinga a pêk cheu ram chu in sukpawrche nawna dingin."
