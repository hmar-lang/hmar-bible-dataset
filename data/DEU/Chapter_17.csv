1,"Thou shalt not sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God an ox, or a sheep, wherein is a blemish, or anything evil; for that is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.","“Bâwngchal amanih, berâm amanih, demkâi le ṭhat nawna hrim hrim nei chun LALPA in Pathien kuomah in inthâwi ding a ni nawh; chu chu LALPA in Pathien ta dingin thil tirdakum a ni sih a."
2,"If there be found in the midst of thee, within any of thy gates which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that doeth that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, in transgressing his covenant,","Nangni laia LALPA in Pathienin a pêk cheu in umna khâwlai khawm, pasal amanih, nuhmei amani khawm, thuthlung bawse a, LALPA in Pathien mithmua thil ṭha naw thaw an um a,"
3,"and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded,","Pathien dang rawng va bâwl a, ka thupêk ni lo, nisa amanih, thla amanih, vâna mi hrim hrim bie an um a, an hril che a,"
4,"and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it; then shalt thou inquire diligently; and, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel,","nangin i lo hriet a, ṭhahnem- ngaitaka în dawn a; a lo indik ngeia, thu chu a chieng faka, chuong anga thil tirdakum Israel mihai laia thaw a lo ni chun,"
5,"then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who hath done this evil thing, unto thy gates, even the man or the woman; and thou shalt stone them to death with stones.","chu thil suol thawtu, pasal ama- nih, nuhmei amani ngei chu ṭhuoi suok in ta, lungin in dêng hlum ding a nih."
6,"At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.","Hretu pahni amanih, pathum amani bâua inthawkin thi ding chu sukhlum ding a nih, hretu pakhat chau bâua inthawk chun sukhlum ding a ni nawh."
7,"The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.","Sukhlumna dinga chun hretuhai chun kut thlâk hmasâng an ta, chu hnungah mipui po poin. Chuong ang chun nangni laia inthawkin thil ṭha naw chu in sukbo ding a nih."
8,"If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates; then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose;","“Inthat thua dâm, sum le pai thua dâm, invuok thua dâm, in umnaa inkhingna thu hrim hrima dâm in ta dinga rêl intak taluo a hung um chun, LALPA in Pathienin hmun a la ruot dinga chun fêng in ta,"
9,"and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days: and thou shalt inquire; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment.","chu huna thiempu Levi mi le rorêltuhai kuoma chun fêng in ta, anni râwn in ta; chun, anni chun thu sukthlûk dân ding an lo khîkhmu ding cheu a nih."
10,And thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show thee from that place which Jehovah shall choose; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee:,"LALPAIN hmun a la ruot dinga inthawka thu sukthlûk dân ding an lo khîkhmu ang cheu chun thâwng in ta, an inchûktir ang pei cheu chun fîmkhurtakin in thaw ding a nih."
11,"according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do; thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.","An thu tlûkna an lo khîkhmu cheu chun changtienga manih, vawi- tienga manih in pêtsan ding a ni nawh."
12,"And the man that doeth presumptuously, in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to minister there before Jehovah thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.","LALPA in Pathien hmaa rawng- bâwla ṭhang hlak thiempu le rorêltu thu pawm loa, thawlui taphawt, chu mi chu sukhlum ding a nih, Israelhai laia inthawkin, chu thil ṭha naw chu in sukbo ding a nih."
13,"And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.","Chuongchun, mi po poin hrieng an ta, ṭîng an ta, thawlui nâwk ta naw ni hai."
14,"When thou art come unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me;","“LALPA in Pathienin ram a pêk cheu chu in va tlung a, in va hluo a, in va um a, ‘Ei vêla hnam po po ang bawkin lal nei ei tiu,’ in ti pha chun;"
15,"thou shalt surely set him king over thee, whom Jehovah thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee; thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother.","LALPA in Pathienin a ithlang ngei chu lalah in nei ding a nih; in unau laia mi pakhat lalah in siem ding a nih; hnam dang mi, in unau ni lo chu nangni awptu dingin in siem ding a ni nawh."
16,"Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; forasmuch as Jehovah hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.","Amiruokchu, sakawr a hau ding a ni nawh, sakawr a hau theina dingin Aigupta mihai le chun inthu- ruol ding a ni bawk nawh. LALPA chun, ‘Tuta chen chu, chu tienga chun in kîr nâwk ding a ni ta nawh,’ a ti tlat sih a."
17,"Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.","Chuong naw chun a lungril invâkhmang rawi a tih. Nuhmei khawm a hau ding a ni nawh a, tangka le rângkachak khawm a hau bawk ding a ni nawh."
18,"And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites:","Chun, a ram lalṭhungphaa a ṭhung pha khawm thiempu Levi mihai kawl hlak dân hi lekhabuah inziek sâwngtir a ta,"
19,"and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;","kawl a ta, a dam sûng chun a tiem rawp hlak ding a nih, hieng dân le hieng thuruothai po po hi pawma, zâwma thaw dinga LALPA a Pathien ṭi dân ân chûk theina dingin;"
20,"that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.","a lungril a unauhai chungah ân sie sâng nawna dingin le changtienga manih, vawitienga manih thupêk chu a pêtsan nawna ding le Israelhai lai chun ama le a thlahai a rama hin an dam sâwt phâna dingin."
