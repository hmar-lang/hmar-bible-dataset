1,"And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein,","“LALPA in Pathienin rohluo ding le hluo dinga ram a pêk cheu in va hluo a, in va um pha chun;"
2,"that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee; and thou shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.","LALPA in Pathienin a pêk cheu in ram leilung ra hmasatak senghai chu hung lâng in ta; bâwmah sieng in ta, LALPA in Pathienin a hming inumtirna dinga a la ruot dinga chun in fe ding a nih."
3,"And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto Jehovah thy God, that I am come unto the land which Jehovah sware unto our fathers to give us.","Chu huna thiempu kuoma chun fêng in ta, a kuomah, ‘Mi pêk dinga kan pi le puhai kuoma ṭawng a lo inkhâmna ramah kan hung tah ti vawisûn hin LALPA kan Pathien kuomah kan suklang a nih,’ tîng in ta."
4,"And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God.","Thiempu chun in kuta inthawk chun bâwm chu lâng a ta, LALPA in Pathien mâichâm bula chun inṭhut a tih."
5,"And thou shalt answer and say before Jehovah thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous.","Chun, LALPA in Pathien hmaa chun, ‘Kan pu chu Suria mi, mi invai a na, Aigupta ramah a zu feh a, a zu um zing a, tlâwmte an na; chun, chu- taka chun hnam ropuitak, thilthaw- theitak, tamtak an hung ni tah a."
6,"And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:","Aigupta mihai chun an mi suk- nawmna a, an mi sukrimsih a, sin intaktakhai an mîn thawtir a."
7,"and we cried unto Jehovah, the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression;","Chuongchun, LALPA kan pi le puhai Pathien chu kan ko a, LALPA chun kan rawl chu a lo hriet a, kan rimsikzie dâm, kan sin inrimzie dâm, nêksâwr kan nizie dâm a hriet a."
8,"and Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders;","LALPA chun Aigupta rama in- thawk chun kut hrâttak le, bân phar dâm, thil ṭiumtak dâm, inchiknahai dâm le thilmakhaiin a mi ṭhuoi suok a;"
9,"and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.","hi hmuna hin a mi ṭhuoi lût a, hi ram, nênetui le khuoizu luongna ram hi a mi pêk a."
10,"And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which thou, O Jehovah, hast given me. And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God:","Chun, ngai ta, aw LALPA, nangin i mi pêk leihnuoi ra hmasa takhai seng kan hung lâk hi,’ in va ti ding a nih. Chun, LALPA in Pathien hmaa chun inṭhut in ta, LALPA in Pathien hmaah chibai bûkin in kûn ding a nih."
11,"and thou shalt rejoice in all the good which Jehovah thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the sojourner that is in the midst of thee.","LALPA in Pathienin in sûng- kuohai, nangni dâm, Levi mihai dâm, nangni laia ram dang mihai thil ṭha a pêk po po cheua chun hlimtakin in um ding a nih."
12,"When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then thou shalt give it unto the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled.","“Kum thum kuma sâwma pakhat pêk kuma in thil rasuok po po sâwma pakhat in pêk zo chun, Levi mihai dâm, ram dang mihai dâm, pa neinawhai, hmeithaihaiin in umnaa chun an fâk a, an lo khawsak thei vena dingin in pêk ding a nih."
13,"And thou shalt say before Jehovah thy God, I have put away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed any of thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:","Chun, LALPA in Pathien hmaah, ‘I thu mi pêk, i thupêk po po angin kan ina inthawkin thil in- thienghai chu kan sie suok a, Levi mihai dâm, ram dang mihai dâm, pa nei nawhai dâm, hmeithaihai dâm kan pêk tah a; i thupêk chu a ieng- khawm kan bawsiet nawh a, kan theinghil bawk nawh."
14,"I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah my God; I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.","Kan lusûn laiin chutaka mi chu kan fâk nawh a, kan pawrche laiin kan sukthâm bawk nawh a, mithi puolah kan pêk bawk nawh; LALPA kan Pathien rawl chu kan ngai zing a, i thu mi pêk ang po po chun kan thaw a nih."
15,"Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the ground which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.","I umna inthieng vâna inthawk chun hung en la, nênetui le khuoizu luongna ram, kan pi le puhai pêk dinga ṭawng i lo inkhâm tah ang khan i mi Israelhai le i leilung mi pêk hi malsâwm rawh,’ in ti ding a nih."
16,"This day Jehovah thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.","“Vawisûn hin LALPA in Pathien chun hieng dân le rorêlhai hi zâwm dingin thu a pêk cheu a nih. Chuleiin, in lungril po po le in lungvar po poin in pawmin in zâwm ding a nih."
17,"Thou hast avouched Jehovah this day to be thy God, and that thou wouldest walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and hearken unto his voice:","Vawisûn hin LALPA chu a lam- puihai hrawh a, a dânhai le a thupêkhai le a rorêlhai chu zâwm a, a rawl chu ngai dingin in Pathien dingin in thlang tah a;"
18,"and Jehovah hath avouched thee this day to be a people for his own possession, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;","chun, vawisûn hin a tiem ta cheu ang khan, a thupêkhai po po chu in zâwm a, ama chanpuol bîk ni ding le"
19,"and to make thee high above all nations that he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken.","a lo hril ta anga LALPA in Pathien ta dinga mi inthieng in ni theina ding le hnam a siem po po laiah a bîka inpâk dâm, hming ṭhat dâm, chawimawi dâm hlaw dingin LALPAIN a thlang cheu a nih,” tiin."
