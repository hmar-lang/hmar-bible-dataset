verse_no,en,hmr
1,At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.,"“Chun, kum sari ân vawi kum poah ngaidamna in siem ding a na."
2,And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Jehovah’s release hath been proclaimed.,"Ngaidam dân chu hieng ang hi nîng a tih; leiba neitu taphawtin an tuolbâwmhai an lo inpûktir ta chu a ngaidam ding a nih; a tuolbâwm khawm, a unau khawm a ṭhîn lui ding a ni nawh, LALPA ngaidamna chu phuong a ni ta leiin."
3,Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release.,"Hnam dang mi chu ṭhîn lui thei in ta; nisienlakhawm, in ta ieng- khawm in unauhai lo hmang ta chu in ngaidam ding a nih."
4,"Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee (for Jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it),","Mi rimsi hrim hrim um dêr naw ti niu, (LALPA in Pathienin hluo dinga a pêk cheu rama chun LALPAIN mal a sâwm ngei ngei ding cheu a nih,)"
5,"if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.","hieng thupêk, tuta ka thupêk po po cheu hi pawm dinga LALPA in Pathien râwl chu ṭhahnemngaitaka in zâwm phawt chun."
6,"For Jehovah thy God will bless thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.","LALPA in Pathien chun a tiem ta cheu angin mal sâwm a ti cheu a, hnam tamtak inpûktir in ta, nangni ruok chun chu pûk naw ti niu; hnam tamtak chungah ro rêl in ta, in chung- a ruok chun ro rêl ve naw ni hai."
7,"If there be with thee a poor man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates in thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother;","“LALPAIN ram a pêk cheua in umnaa in unauhai lai rimsi an um chun in unau rimsihai kâwla chun in lungril sukngar naw unla, tiksie bawk naw ro."
8,"but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth.","An kuoma chun in tiktlai ngei ding a nih, an tlâksamnaa an mamaw phuhrûkna tâwk in inpûktir ding a nih."
9,"Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto Jehovah against thee, and it be sin unto thee.","‘Ngaidam kum, kum sarina chu a hung tlung ding a ni tah,’ tiin in unauhai chu hmu nuom loin, ieng- khawm pe nuom loin in lungrila indik nawtaka ngaituona um lo dingin fîmkhur ro; chuong naw chun, ama chun in chungchâng thuah LALPA ko a ta, i ta dingin suol hung ni rawi a tih."
10,"Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.","In pêk ngei ngei ding a nih, chun, in pêk pha khawm in lungril ân hmûr dêr ding a ni nawh, chuong ang thil lei chun a nih LALPA in Pathienin in thil thaw po poa le in kutsuok po poah mal a sâwm ding cheu chu."
11,"For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy brother, to thy needy, and to thy poor, in thy land.","Chu rama chun mi rimsihai um naw lai a um âwm si nawh a; chuleiin, ‘In rama in unauhai chunga dâm, tlasamhai chunga dâm, in mirimsihai chunga dâm, in tiktlai ngei ngei ding a nih,’ tiin thu ka pêk cheu a nih."
12,"If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.","“In unau Hebrai pa amanih, Hebrai nu amanih in kuomah an zawr a, kum ruk in rawng an bâwl chun kum sari kum chun in insuo ding a nih."
13,"And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty:","Chun, in insuoktir pha chun kutbenthekin in insuoktir ding a ni nawh;"
14,"thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.","in berâm ruol laia mi dâm, in hrizâwla mi dâm, in uoiin sâwrna khura mi dâm chu inro lotakin in pêk ding a nih; LALPA in Pathienin mal a sâwm dân ang pei cheuin in pêk ding a nih."
15,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to-day.","Aigupta rama khan suok in ni tah a, LALPA in Pathienin ân tlan cheu ti kha in hriet zing ding a nih; chu lei chun a nih, hieng thu hi tuhin ka pêk cheu chu."
16,"And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go out from thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee;","Nangni le in sûngkuo an ngai- nat lei le in inpâwlthiem leia in kuomah,"
17,"then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maid-servant thou shalt do likewise.","‘Suoksan naw ning cheu,’ an ti tlat chun, thîr zum lâng in ta, kawtkhâr sana chun an na ver in tih, chuongchun, kumkhawtluongin in suok ni tâng an tih, in suoknu khawm chu chuong ang bawk chun in thaw ding a nih."
18,"It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years: and Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.","Insuoktir chu thil harsaah in ngai ding a ni nawh, inhlawfa ruoina zâtve chauin kum ruk sûng in rawng an bâwlpêk ta si cheu a; chun, LALPA in Pathienin in thilthaw taphawtah malsâwmpêk pei a ti cheu."
19,"All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto Jehovah thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy herd, nor shear the firstling of thy flock.","“In ran ruol dâm, in berâm ruolhai laia pieng hmasatak a chal taphawt chu LALPA in Pathien kuomah inthiengah in pêk ding a nih; in bâwngchal pieng hmasatak chu sinthawhah in sawr ding a ni nawh a, in berâm ruolhai laia pieng hma- satak hmul chu in vâw ding a ni nawh."
20,"Thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God year by year in the place which Jehovah shall choose, thou and thy household.","LALPAIN hmun a la ruot dinga chun in fâk ding a nih, nangni le in sûnghai leh."
21,"And if it have any blemish, as if it be lame or blind, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto Jehovah thy God.","Dem kaina nei, a ke inbai amanih, a mit indel amanih, dem kaina ieng ang khawm nei taphawt chu LALPA in Pathien kuomah inthâwina dingin in hmang ding a ni nawh."
22,"Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.","Nangni umhmunah in fâk el ding a nih; inthienghai le inthieng nawhai khawmin sangaihai, sakhihai in fâk ang bawkin fa thei in tih."
23,Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.,"A thisen ruok chu in fâk dêr ding a ni nawh, tui angin hnuoiah in bunthlâk el ding a nih."
