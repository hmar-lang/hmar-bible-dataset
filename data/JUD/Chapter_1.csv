2,Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied.,"Lunginsietna dâm, inremna dâm, hmangaina dâm, in chunga suk- pungin um raw se."
3,"Beloved, while I was giving all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation, I was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.","Dittakhai, ei ichang tlâng san- damna thu in kuoma ziek ka tum hrâm laiin, mi inthienghai kuoma ringna ṭum khata inkawltira um ta chu hum dinga ṭhahnemngai taka thaw dinga infui ding cheuin, in kuomah lekha ziek a ṭul ti ka lo hriet a."
4,"For there are certain men crept in privily, even they who were of old written of beforehand unto this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.","Mi tuhai amanih inrûka lût an um sih a; chuonghai chu Pathien ngaisak naw mihai an na, Pathien lunginsietna chu hurnaah an inchangtir a, ei hotu le ei Lalpa nei- sun Isu Krista chu, an awi naw bawk a. Chuong ang mihai thiemnaw chang ding zie chu tienlaia inthawk tah ziek a nih."
5,"Now I desire to put you in remembrance, though ye know all things once for all, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.","Hieng hi vawikhat lo hre vawng ta khawm ni unla, Lalpa chun Aigupta rama inthawka mihai a san- suok a, chu hnunga chun a ring- nawhai chu a sukbohmang zie kha inhrietthartir cheu ka nuom a nih."
6,"And angels that kept not their own principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath kept in everlasting bonds under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.","Chun, vântirkohai anni nîna pawm loa, an umna pângngai fe san lemhai chu, ni ropui rorêlnaa dingin inthim hnuoiah chatuon khuopnaa khuop pumin a khêk a nih."
7,"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, having in like manner with these given themselves over to fornication and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.","Sodom le Gomorra, an kâwl vêla khuohai leh, chuong ang bawka inditnaa inpumpêkin, tisa danglam châka an hnawt ve ta leiin chatuona meia hremna tuora, inhriettirna dinga târ suoka an um ang khan."
8,"Yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh, and set at nought dominion, and rail at dignities.","Chuong mihai khawm chun, chuong ang bawkin zêla an umnaa an thil hriethai leiin tisa an sukpawrche a, rorêlpêkna chu an hmusit a, ropuinahai an hrilsiet hlak."
9,"But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.","Nisienlakhawm, Mikael, vântir- ko chunghnungtak hman khan, Diebol le an inthawh a, Mosie ruong thua an insêl laiin, Diebol chungthu rêl pêkin a hrilsiet ngam nawh a, “Lalpân hal lem raw se che,” a ti ta lem a."
10,"But these rail at whatsoever things they know not: and what they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, in these things are they destroyed.","Chuong mihai ruok chun thil an hriet naw taphawt an hrilsiet hlak a, chun, ngaituona neinaw sahai anga hrietna piengpui an neihai chu, chu kawng ngeia chun an insuksiet hlak."
11,"Woe unto them! for they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.","An chung a rik ie! Kaina lampui chu an hraw a, hlaw hmu dingin Balaam suol lampuia chun an tlân rak rak a. Kora helnaa chun an bohmang ta kha."
12,"These are they who are hidden rocks in your love-feasts when they feast with you, shepherds that without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;","Chuonghai chu, zakmaw taka an insukhlimtuona leiin, hmangaina ruoi in ṭhenaa chun, in hmêlsietna an nih; mâni hmakhuo chau ngai mi an nih a; sûm tui painaw, thli imût lênghai an nih; favânga thing ra naw, vawi hni thi tah, a zung puma phawi dawkhai an nih;"
13,"wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved for ever.","tuisuoriet fâwn invawr, mâni muolphona inhuom suokhai an nih; arasi invâk invâk, chatuona inthim sa mup khêk pêkhai chu an nih."

15,"to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.","mi po po chunga rorêl ding le, Pathien ngaisak nawhai po po Pa- thien ngaisak nâwna sin Pathien ngaisaknaw puma an thâwna po po kawnga le, Pathien ngaisaknaw mi suolhaiin an chungthu ngartaka an hril po po kawnga, thiemnaw inchangtir dingin,” tiin."
16,"These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaketh great swelling words), showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage.","Chuonghai chu chiertu le sawi- sêltuhai an na, anni châkna ang peiin an um a, an bauhai khawmin uongna thu puomtakin a hril a, hlâwkna dit leiin mi an ngaina hlak a nih."
17,"But ye, beloved, remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;","Nisienlakhawm, dittakhai, nangni chun, ei Lalpa Isu Krista tirkohaiin thu an hril lâwkhai kha hre zing ro."
18,"that they said to you, In the last time there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.","“Hun nuhnunga chun Pathien ngaisaknaw tieng anni châkna ang peia umin, nuisantuhai la hung um an tih,” ti in kuoma an hrilziehai kha."
19,"These are they who make separations, sensual, having not the Spirit.","Chuong mihai chu tisa mi, Thlarau neinaw, pâwl tumhai siemtu chu an nih."
20,"But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,","Nisienlakhawm, dittakhai, nangni chun in awi san inthieng tak chunga chun nangni le nangni inrem sângin,"
21,"keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.","Thlarau Inthienga ṭawngṭaiin; chatuon hringna inneitirna khawp ei Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna chu nghâk pumin, Pathien hmangainaa chun inkawl ṭha ro."
22,"And on some have mercy, who are in doubt;","Ṭhenkhat ringhlaa umhai chu lunginsiet ro,"
23,"and some save, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.","ṭhenkhat meia inthawkin la suok vak unla, sandam ro, ṭhenkhat, an tisa inthiengnaw kaina silfên chen khawm chu tirdakin, ṭit pumin lunginsiet ro."
24,"Now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy,","Chuongchun, in tlûk nâwna dinga vêng thei cheu le, a ropuina hma ngeiah nasataka hlimin inthieng nawna kai nawa sietheitu cheu,"
25,"to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore. Amen.","ei Sandamtu Pathien tak chau kuoma chun, ei Lalpa Isu Krista leiin, hun hrim um hma le, tuta le chatuon chenin, chawimawina dâm, ropuina dâm, rorêlna dâm, thuneina dâm um raw se. Amen."
