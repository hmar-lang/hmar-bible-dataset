1,And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.,"Chun, naupang Samuel chun Eli hmaa chun LALPA rawng a bâwl a. Chuong lai chun LALPA thu chu a hlu hle el a, ân langa inlârnahai a um nawh a."
2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),","Chun, hieng hi a hung na, Eli chu ama hmuna a zâl laiin (a mit ân thim ta deu a, khuo a hmu ṭha thei mang ta nawh a),"
3,"and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;","Pathien khâwnvar khawm a la thi hmain, Pathien bâwm umna LALPA biek ina chun Samuel chu a hang zâl a;"
4,"that Jehovah called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.","LALPA chun Samuel chu a ko a, ama chun, “Hitaka hi ka um,” a ta."
5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.","Chun, Eli kuoma chun a va tlân a, a kuomah, “Hitaka hi ka um, i mi ko a,” a ta. Ama chun, “Ka ko naw che ie, va zâl nâwk ta rawh,” a ta."
6,"And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel chu a ko nâwk a. Samuel chu a tho a, Eli kuoma chun a feh a, “Hitaka hi ka um, i mi ko a,” a ta. Ama chun a dawn a, “Ka ko naw che ie, ka naupa, va zâl nâwk ta rawh,” a ta."
7,"Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.","Chuong lai chun Samuel chun LALPA a la hriet nawh a, LALPA thu a kuoma phuong a la ni naw bawk a."
8,"And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel a ko nâwk a, chu chu a vawi thumna a nih. Chun, a tho a, Eli kuoma chun a feh a, “Hitaka hi ka um, i mi ko a,” a ta. Chuongchun, Eli chun naupang chu LALPAIN a ko a nih ti a lo hriet tah a."
9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.","Chuleiin, Eli chun Samuel kuom- a chun, “Fe la, va zâl nâwk phawt la, a ko nâwk che chun, ‘LALPA, thu hril rawh, i siehlaw hin a ngai zing,’ ti el rawh” a ta. Chuongchun, Samuel chu a hmuna chun a va zâl nâwk tah a."
10,"And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.","Chun, LALPA chu a hung a, a hung ngîr a, a hmaa a ko ang khan, “Samuel, Samuel,” tiin a ko nâwk a. Chuongchun, Samuel chun, “Thu hril rawh, I siehlaw hin a ngai zing,” a ta."
11,"And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, Israel rama hin a hre taphawthai na chu a khing hni hnia a ṭhâwng zâwngtakin thil ka thaw ding a nih."
12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.",Chu ni chun a sûngkuo chung- châng thu ka hril po po chu a bula inthawka a tâwp chenin Eli chunga hin ka thaw ding a nih.
13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.",A nauhaiin Pathien an hrilsiet- na suol chu hre zing pumin a khap naw leiin a sûngkuo chu kumkhuoa dingin ka ngaituo ding a nih ti ka hril ta sih a.
14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.","Chuleiin, Eli sûngkuo kuoma chun Eli sûnghai bawsietna chu in- thâwinain amanih, thilinhlânin ama- nih iengtika khawm sukkieng thei ni naw nih, tiin ṭawng kân khâm tah a nih,” a ta."
15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.","Samuel chu zingkâr chenin a zâl a; chun, LALPA in kawtkhârhai chu a hawng a, Samuel chun chuong inlârna chu Eli inhriettir ding chu a ṭih a."
16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.","Chun, Eli chun Samuel chu a ko a, “Samuel, ka naupa,” a ta. Ama chun, “Hitaka hin ka um,” a ta."
17,"And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.","Chun, ama chun, “Ieng thil am LALPA chun i kuomah a hril lie? Ka kuoma hin iengkhawm ip naw rawh aw; i kuoma a hril po po chu ka kuomah ip i nei chun i chungah Pathien chun a thaw thawin thaw sienla, chu nêka nasa khawmin,” a ta."
18,"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.","Chun, Samuel chu a hung a, iengkim el chu a hril fai vawng a, a kuoma chun iengkhawm ip a nei nawh a. Chun, ama chun, “LALPA a nih annâwm, ṭha a ti ang peiin thaw raw se,” a ta."
19,"And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.","Chun, Samuel chu a hung in- ṭhanglien deu deu a, a kuomah LALPA a um pei a; a thu hrim hrim chu lei- hnuoiah ân luonghmangtir el nawh a."
20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, Dana inthawka Beer-seba tlung rakin Israel mi po pohai chun Samuel chu LALPA zâwlnei dinga sukdet a ni tah ti an hriet tah a."
21,And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.,"Chun, LALPA chu Siloa chun ân lâr nâwk a; LALPA chu thuin Samuel kuoma chun Siloa chun ân lâr a ni sih a."
