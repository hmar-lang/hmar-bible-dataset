1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:","Ephraim tlâng rama Ramathaim- zophim khuoa chun mi pakhat a um a, a hming chu Elkana a nih; ama chu Jeroham naupa a na, ama chu Elihu naupa a na, ama chu Tohu naupa a na, ama chu Ephraim mi Zuph naupa a nih."
2,"and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.","Nuhmei pahni a nei a, pakhat hming chu Hanna a na, a dang hming chu Peninna a nih; chun, Peninna chun nauhai a nei a, Hanna ruok chun nau a nei ve nawh a."
3,"And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there.","Chun, ama chu an khuoa in- thawkin Silo khuoah sipaihai LALPA chu be dingin kum tin a hang fe hlak a. Chutaka chun Eli naupasalhai pahni, Hophni le Phinehas, LALPA thiempuhai chu an um a."
4,"And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:","Chun, Elkana inthâwi ni a hung tlung chun a nuhmei Peninna le a naupasalhai le a naunuhai po po chu chanvo a siempêk a."
5,"but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.","Hanna ta ding ruok chun chan hni a siempêk a, Hanna chu a hmangai êm êm sih a; nisienla- khawm, LALPAIN a sul a sukping- pêk a."
6,"And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.","Chun, LALPAIN a sul a suk- pingpêk leiin a lungngaina chu chawktho tumin a khingpui chun a lo thaw rawp hlak a."
7,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.","Chuong anga kum tin a lo thaw hlak leiin, LALPA ina a hang fe zâtin a lungngaina chu amanu chun a lo chawktho hlak a. Chuleiin, Hanna chu a ṭap a ṭap a, bu khawm a fâk nawh a."
8,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?","Chun, a pasal Elkana chun a kuomah, “Hanna, ieng dinga i ṭap am? Ieng dinga bu i fâk naw am a na? Ieng dinga i lungril i suknat am? Nau- pasal sâwm nêk khawmin i ta dingin ka ṭha lem a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.","Chun, Silo khuoa bu an fâk a an dâwn zo chun Hanna chu a tho a. Thiempu Eli chu LALPA biek in kawtkhâr ban bula a ṭhungnaa chun a ṭhung a."
10,"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.","Chun, Hanna chu a lungril a lunginzîng êm êm el a, LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a, lungsetakin a ṭap a."
11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.","Chun, thu a tiem a, “Aw sipaihai LALPA, i suoknu tlâwmzie hi i hriet tak meu a, i mi hriet zing a, i suoknu hi i mi theinghil nawh a, i suoknu hi naupasal i pêk chun a dam sûng po chu LALPA pe ve thung ka ta, a lu khawm vâw hrim hrim ni naw ni,” a ta."
12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.","Chun, LALPA hmaa a ṭawngṭai zing lai chun Eli chun a hmûr châng chu a lo inchik a."
13,"Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.","Hanna chun a lungrilin a hril a, a hmûr chu a châng a, a râwl chu hriet a ni nawh a; chuleiin, Eli chun zu ân rui niin a ring a."
14,"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.","Chuongchun, Eli chun a kuomah, “Ieng chen am inrui zinga i um ding a na? I uoin chu sie hmang raw khai,” a ta."
15,"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.","Hanna chun a dawn a, “Ni lo, ka lalpa, nuhmei lungril lungngai tâwp- khâwk ka na; uoin khawm, zupui khawm ka dâwn dêr nawh a, LALPA hmaa chun ka lungril ka phawr lem a nih."
16,Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.,"I suoknu hi Belial naunuah inbûk naw raw khai; ka lungrila sip liem ka lungninawna le ka lung- ngaina ka hril a ni hi,” a ta."
17,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him.","Eli chun, “Lungmuongtakin fe raw khai, Israelhai Pathien chun i thil hni chu pe raw se che,” a tih a, a dawn a."
18,"And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more sad.","Ama chun, “I siehlawnu hi i mittlung ni raw se,” a ta. Chuong- chun, nuhmei chu a fe tah a, bu dâm a fâk a, lungngai hmêl a put ta nawh a."
19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her;","Chun, zingkâr an tho a, LALPA chu an biek a, an fe tah a, Rama khuoa an in chu an tlung nâwk tah a; chun, Elkana chun a nuhmei Hanna chu a pâwl a, chun, LALPAIN ama chu a hriet zing a."
20,"and it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Hanna chun nau a vawn a; a hun a hung tlung chun naupasal a nei a, “LALPA ka ihni a nih,” tiin a hminga chun Samuel a sak a."
21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.","Chun, Elkana le a sûnghai po po chu LALPA kuoma an kum tin inthâwina inhlân ding le an thutiem hlen dingin an hang feh a."
22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.","Hanna ruok chu a hang fe ve nawh a; a pasal kuoma chun, “Kei chu naute hin nêne nêk a bân hmakhat chu hang fe ve naw ning ah; chu pha ruok chun LALPA hmaha ân lang theina dingin ṭhuoi ka ta, chutaka chun um zing el tâng a tih,” a ta."
23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.","A pasal Elkana chun a kuomah, “Ṭha âwma i ti ang phawt chun thaw el rawh; a nêne nêk în bântir chenin um rawh, amiruokchu, LALPA chun a thu chu sukdet ngei raw se,” a ta. Chuongchun, a nêne nêk bân hma- khat chun nuhmei chu a um tah a, a naupa chu a enkawl a."
24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young.","Chun, nêne nêk ân bântir phing chun beiphit epha khat le uoin saidawiûm khat chawiin sebâwng pathum leh a hang ṭhuoi a, Silo khuoa LALPA ina chun a fepui a; naupang chu a la naupang hleh a."
25,"And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.","Chun, bâwngchal chu an that a, naupang chu Eli kuoma chun an ṭhuoi a."
26,"And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah.","Chun, ama chun, “Aw ka lalpa, i hringna sâlin ka hril a, kei chu aw lalpa, hi hmuna i kâwla ngîr a, LALPA kuoma ṭawngṭaitu nuhmei ka ni ngei a."
27,For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:,"Hi naupang hni hin ka ṭawngṭai a na, chun, LALPA chun ka hni chu a mi pêk tah a."
28,therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.,"Chuleiin, kei khawma LALPA kuomah kân hlân a nih; a dam sûng poa LALPA ta dinga inhlân a nih,” a ta. Chun, chutaka chun LALPA chu a biek a."
