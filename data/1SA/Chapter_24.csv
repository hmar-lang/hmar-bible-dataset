1,"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.","Chun, Saula chu Philistin mihai a va hnawt a hung chun, “Ngai ta, David chu En-gedi thlalêrah a um,” tiin an hril a."
2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.","Chuongchun, Saula chun Israel mi po pohai laia thlang ṭhieu mi sâng thum a ṭhuoi a, sakêlhai umna lungpui laia chun David le a mihai zawng dingin a fe tah a."
3,"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.","Chun, lam kârlaka chun berâm huon umna pûk hi a va tlung a; chun, Saula chu inthier fihlîm dingin a va lût a. Chun, David le a mihai chu pûk sûngril tieng chun an um a."
4,"And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.","Chun, David mihai chun a kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, LALPAIN i kuomah, ‘Ngai ta, i hmêlma chu i kutah pêng ka ta, a chungah ṭha i ti ang angin thaw rawh,’ a ti ni kha a ni ta hi,” an ta. Chuongchun, David chu a tho a, inrûkin Saula puon hmawr chu a va ât thlâk a."
5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.","Chun, Saula puon hmawr a va ât thlâk chun David lungril chu a sukna hleh a."
6,"And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah’s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah’s anointed.","Chuongchun, a mihai kuoma chun, “LALPA hrieknâl a nih ti hre zing sih a, a chunga kut thlâk a, LALPA hrieknâl ka lalpa chunga hi thil ka thaw hi a âwm naw tawp el a,” a ta."
7,"So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.","Chuongchun, David chun chuong thuhai chun a mihai chu a khap a, Saula thaw dinga an suok chu a phal ta nawh a. Chun, Saula chu pûka inthawk chun a suok a, a fe tah a."
8,"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.","A hnung ela chun David khawm chu a tho a, pûka inthawk chun a suok a, “Lalpa, ka lalpa,” tiin Saula chu a ko zui a. Chun, Saula chu a nghakîr chun, David chun a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a."
9,"And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?","Chun, David chun Saula kuomah, “Ngai ta, ‘David hin i sietna ding a zawng a nih,’ tiha mihaiin i kuoma an hril chu iengdinga i awi hlak am a na?"
10,"Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovah’s anointed.","Ngai ta, vawisûn hin LALPAIN pûka hin ka kuta a hung inhlânzie che hi i mit ngeiin i hmuh a; ṭhenkhat chun sukhlum ding chein an mi tir a; nisienlakhawm, ka hla cheh a; ka lalpa chunga hin ka kut hrim hrim inlet naw ning, LALPA hrieknâl a ni sih a, ka tih a."
11,"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou huntest after my life to take it.","Chu chau khawm chu ni loin, pa, en ta, hi i puon hmawr khawm ka chawi zing hi: i puon hmawr ka ât thlâk thei siha, ka sukhlum nawna chea hin ka kuta hin thil ṭha naw le bawsietna a um nawh ti le, ka hringna lâk tumin mi zawng la khawm, i chunga hin ka suol naw a nih ti hi hre zing ngei ngei raw khai."
12,"Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee.","LALPA chun nang le keia chungthu hi rêl raw se; chun, LALPA chun i chungah phuba mi lapêk raw se; nisienlakhawm, kei chun chu i chungah kut thlâk naw hrim hrim ka tih."
13,"As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee.","Tienlai mihai thuvarin, ‘Mi suola inthawkin suol a hung suok hlak a,’ a tih a, nisienlakhawm, i chungah kut thlâk naw ning,"
14,"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.","Israel lal hi tu zawnga hung suok am a na? Tu am a na i hnawt? Ui pûl thi, uihrik el."
15,"Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.","Chuleiin, LALPA chu rorêltu ni sienla, nang le keia chungthu hi sukthlu sienla, mi ngaituopêkin mi hrilpui sien la, i kuta inthawk hin mi sansuok raw se,” a ta."
16,"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.","Chun, Davidin Saula kuoma hieng thu hi a hril zo chun Saula chun, “Hi hi i râwl a ni maw, ka naupa David?” a ta. Chun, Saula chu râwl insuo meuin a ṭap tah a."
17,"And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil.","David kuoma chun, “Keia nêk chun i fel lem êm êm a nih, nang chun chu ka chungah thil ṭha i thawh a, kei ruok chun chu thil ṭha naw ka thaw a nih."
18,"And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killedst me not.","Chun, vawisûn hin ka chunga thil ṭha i thawzie i suklang tah a nih; LALPAIN i kuta a mi pêk sa khawma i mi sukhlum nawa hin."
19,"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day.","Miin a hmêlma hmu ang sienla, tlangtakin ân suo nuom ding am a nih? Chuleiin, vawisûna ka chunga i thilthawa hin LALPAIN thil ṭhain thung raw se che."
20,"And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.","Ngai ta, lal i la ni ngei ding a na, Israel ram chu i kutah sukdetin a um ding a ni ti ka hriet tah."
21,"Swear now therefore unto me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.","Chuleiin, keia hnunga ka thla- hai la hung um dinghai chu sukbo- hmang naw ding le, ka pa sûngkuo laia inthawka ka hming sukbo lo dingin LALPA hmingin ka kuomah ṭawng inkhâm raw khai,” a ta."
22,And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the stronghold.,"Chuongchun, David chun Saula kuoma chun ṭawng ân khâm tah a. Chun, Saula chu a fe tah a, David le a mihai ruok chu kulbînga chun an hang fe tah a."
