1,"Saul was forty years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,",Ro a rêl ṭan chun Saula chu kum sâwmthuma upa a na; Israelhai chungah kum hni ro a rêl a.
2,"Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.","Chun, Saula chun Israelhai laia mi sâng thum a thlang a, sâng hni chu Mikmasa le Bethel tlângah Saula kuomah an um a; sâng khat chu Benjamin rama Gibeaa Jonathan kuomah an um a; a dang po chu anni puon inah ân fetir vawng a."
3,"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.","Chun, Jonathan chun Gebaa Philistin râl vêngtu sipaihai a thawh a, chu chu Philistin mihai chun an lo hriet a. Chuongchun, Saula chun, “Hebrai mihai khan lo hre seng raw hai seh,” tiin an ram po poah taw- tawrâwt ân mûttir a."
4,"And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.","Chun, Israelhai po po chun Saula chun Philistin râl vêngtu sipaihai a thaw ti le Israelhai khawmin Philistin mihai theida an phur a nih ti an lo hriet tah a. Chuongchun, mipuihai chu Gilgala chun Saula kuomah an pungkhâwm ta ṭeu el a."
5,"And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu Israel- hai do ding chun an inpun khâwm ta ṭeu el a, tawlailîr sîng thum, sakawr chung chuong mi sâng ruk, sipai chu tuisuoriet panga phaiphin zât zet an nih; chun, an hang feh a, Beth-aven saktieng panga Mikmasa chun ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.","Chun, Israel mihai chun hnaw- chêpin an um ti an inhriet chun, (mihai chu an lunginzîng ta hle el a) mihai chu pûka hai, chîmbuka hai, lungpui phêna hai, kula hai, khur sûnga hai an inbih a."
7,"Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.","Hebrai mi ṭhenkhat chu Jordan râla Gad le Gilead rama dâm an tlân a; Saula ruok chu Gilgala chun a la um zing a, mipuihai chun inthin dawr dawr pumin an zui a."
8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.","Samuelin ni a ruot angin ni sari chu a um a, nisienlakhawm, Samuel chu Gilgala chun a la fe ta naw rawp a; chuongchun, mipui chun an tlân dar san tah a."
9,"And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.","Chun, Saula chun, “Pumraw- hmang thilinhlân ding le inremna thilinhlân dinghai chu hitakah ka kuomah hung la ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu ân hlân a."
10,"And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu ân hlân zo chaua, ngai ta, Samuel chu a hung tlung tah a; chun, Saula chun chibai bûk dingin ama tuok dingin a feh a."
11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;","Chun, Samuel chun, “Ieng am a ni leh i lo thaw chu?” a ta. Saula chun, “Mipuihai chun an mi fe hmangsan tah a; nang hlak chu ni ruot nia chun i hung tlung ta nawh a; Philistin mihai hlak chu Mikmasa chun an pung- khâwm huk tah ti ka hriet sih a."
12,"therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.","Chuleiin, ‘Philistin mihai chun Gilgala hin an mi hung thaw ding a ni ṭep sih a, LALPA lunginsietna hlak ka la hni si nawh a,’ ka tih a. Chu- leiin, pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu inhlân naw thei ka ni naw a nih,” a ta."
13,"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuoma chun, “I thil thaw dân hi ân vêtthlâk ngawt el: LALPA i Pathien thupêk, thu a pêk che hi i zâwm naw a nih; LALPA chun Israelhai chunga în lalna hi kumkhuoa dinga sukdet tum chu a nih a."
14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin în lalna chu tâwp tâng a tih; LALPAIN thu a pêk che i zâwm naw leiin LALPA chun ama lungril ang put mi a zawng a, mihai chunga hotu ni dingin LALPAIN a ruot tah a nih,” a ta."
15,"And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.","Chun, Samuel chu a tho a, Gilgala inthawk chun Benjamin rama Gibea khuoa chun a hang feh a. Chun, Saula chun a kuoma mi umhai chu a tiem a, za ruk lai an na."
16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.","Chun, Saula le a naupa Jona- than le an kuoma mi umhai chu Benjamin rama Geba khuoa chun an um a; nisienlakhawm, Philistin mi- hai chun Mikmasa chun ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;","Chun, râlrûk pâwlhai chu Philistin mihai ṭhanghmuna in- thawkin pâwl thumin an hung suok a; pâwl khat hai chun Shual rama Ophra tieng pan lampui an hrawh a,"
18,and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.,"chun, pâwl khat chun Beth- horon tieng pan lampui an hrawh a; chun, pâwl khat chun thlalêr dep Zeboim ruom tieng ngha ramri lampui chu an hrawh a."
19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:","Israel ram pumpuia chun thirsu hrim hrim an um nawh a; Philistin mihai chun, “Hebrai mihai hi kâwl- hnâmhai amanih, feihai amani hi siem hlau rawi an tih,” an ti a nih."
20,"but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;","Nisienlakhawm, Israel mihai po po chu bâwngtuthlaw dâm, hmawl hmawra inbûk thîr dâm chu intât- ngeitir dingin Philistin mihai kuom- ah an zu fe hlak a;"
21,"yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.","chuong an hnuoi inletna thîr ngei le bâwng tuthlaw tâtna man chu sekel hmun thuma ṭhea hmun hni a na, an hreipui le hmawl hmawra thîr inbûk tât man chu sekel hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat a nih."
22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.","Chuongchun, an indo ni chun Saula le Jonathan kuoma mi umhai chun kâwlhnâm amanih, fei amanih nei hrim hrim an um dêr nawh a; Saula le a naupa Jonathan ruok chun an nei a."
23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmash.,"Chun, Philistin râl vêngtu sipaihai chu Mikmas kâwna chun an suok tah a."
