1,"And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.","Chun, David chun a lungrilin “Iengtika mani chu Saula kuta hin ka la bohmang ngei ding chu a ni hi; Philistin mihai rama tlânhmang nêka ṭha hi a um naw ding a ni hi; chuongchun, Saulan Israel ram sûng po poa a mi zawng hi beidawng tâng a ta, chuongchun, a kuta inthawka suok nîng ka tih,” a ta."
2,"And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.","Chuongchun, David chu a tho a, a kuoma mi za ruk umhai le chun Maok naupa Gath lal Akis kuomah an fe tah a."
3,"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.","Chun, David chu ama le a mihai leh, mi tin an sûngkuoin, David khawm a nuhmei pahnihai Jezreel mi Ahinoam le Nabal nuhmei Karmela mi Abigail leh, Gath khuoha Akis kuomah an um tah a."
4,And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.,"Chun, David chu Gath khuoah a tlân ti Saula chu an hril a, chuong- chun, a zawng nâwk ta nawh a."
5,"And David said unto Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?","Chun, David chun Akis kuomah, “Mi lunginsiet la, i rama khuo pa- khata hin umna hmun mi pe hai sienla, chutaka chun um ka tih; i siehlaw hi iengdingin am lal khuoah um zing a ta?” a tih a."
6,Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.,"Chuongchun, Akis chun chu ni chun Ziklag khuo chu a pêk tah a: chuleiin, Ziklag khuo chu tu chen hin Judai ram lalhai ta a ni ta zing a."
7,And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.,"Chun, Philistin rama David a um sûng chu kum khat pumhlûm le thla li a nih."
8,"And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.","Chun, David le a mihai chu an hang feh a, Gesur mihai dâm, Girzi mihai dâm, Amalek mihai dâm an rûn a; chuong hnamhai chu tienlaia inthawkin Sur ram tieng pang Aigupta ram chena um an nih."
9,"And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish.","Chun, David chun ram chu a thaw a, a nuhmei a pasalin hla hrim hrim a nei nawh a, berâmhai dâm, sebâwnghai dâm, sabengtunghai dâm, sanghâwngseihai dâm, an silfên dâm a lâkpêk a; chun a kîr nâwk a, Akis kuomah a feh a."
10,"And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid to-day? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.","Akis chun, “Vawisûn hin khaw tieng am i rûn a?” a ta. David chun, “Juda Sim ram dâm, Jerahmeel Sim ram dâm, Ken mihai Sim ram dâm,” a ta."
11,"And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.","Chun, David chun, “Philistin rama a um sûng hrim hrimin, ‘David chun hieng ang hin a thaw rawp hlak a nih,’ ti rawi an tih,” tiin a nuhmei a pasalin Gath khuoa ṭhuoi ding hrim hrim a hla naw a nih."
12,"And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.","Chun, Akis chun David thuhril chu awiin, “Ama le ama hi Israel mihai ân theidatir ta hle el a, chu- leiin, kumkhuoin ka siehlawah um a tih,” a ta."
