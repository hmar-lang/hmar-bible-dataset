1,"And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors.","Chun, “Ngai ta, Philistin mihai chun Keila khuo an thawh a, hrizâwla buhai chu an lâkpêk vawng el,” tiin David chu an hril a."
2,"Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.","Chuongchun, David chun LALPA chu, “Chuong Philistin mihai chu ka zu thaw ding am a nih?” tiin a râwn a. LALPA chun David kuomah, “Philis- tin mihai chu zu thaw la, Keila khuo chu zu sanhim rawh,” a ta."
3,"And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?","Chun, David mihai chun a kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, Judai rama um zing khawm hin ei ṭi a na, Keila khuoa zu feh a, Philistin sipaihai zu do chu ṭi a va um nâwkzuol âwm de!” an ta."
4,"Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.","Chuongchun, David chun LALPA chu a râwn nâwk tah a. Chun, LALPA chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Tho la, Keila khuoah zu fe thla rawh, Philistin mihai chu i kutah pêng ka tih,” a ta."
5,"And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.","Chuongchun, David le a mihai chu Keila khuoa chun an zu fe tah a, Philistin mihai chu an zu thawh a, an ranhai chu an lâkpêk a, an that ṭeu a. Chuong ang chun David chun Keila khuoa mihai chu a humhim tah a."
6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.","Chun, Ahimelek naupa Abiathar Keila khuoa David kuoma a tlân lai khan thiempu zakawsîng chawia fe thla a na."
7,"And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.","Chun, Keila khuoa chun David chu a fe ti Saula an hril a, Saula chun, “Pathienin ka kutah a mi pêk a ni ta chu, kul kawtkhâr le a kalna nei khuoa chun lûtin ân khum ta sih a,” a ta."
8,"And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.","Chun, Saula chun mi po po chu indo dingin, Keila khuoa chun zu fe a, David le a mihai zûn huol dingin a ko khâwm a."
9,"And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.","David chun Saula chun a chunga thil ṭha naw a ngaituo ti chu a lo hriet a, thiempu Abiathar kuoma chun, “Thiempu zakawsîng kha hung la ta khai,” a ta."
10,"Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.","Chuongchun, David chun, “Aw LALPA, Israelhai Pathien, i siehlaw hin Saula chun keima leia khuo chu sukse dingin, Keila khuoa hin hung thlâk a tum ti ka hriet tlat a."
11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.","Keila khuoa mihai hin a kuta chun an mi pêk el ding am a nih? I siehlawin ka lo hriet ang chun Saula chu a hung thla ding am a nih? Aw LALPA, Israelhai Pathien, ka hni che a nih, i siehlaw hi hung hril rawh,” a ta. Chun, LALPA chun, “A hung thla ding a nih,” a ta."
12,"Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up.","Chuongchun, David chun, “Keila khuoa mihai chun kei le ka mihai hi Saula kutah an mi pêk el ding am a nih?” a ta. Chun, LALPA chun, “Pêng an ti che,” a ta."
13,"Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.","Chuongchun, David le a mihai za ruk lai chu an tho a, Keila khuoa inthawk chu an suok a, fena rem- châng natieng poa chun an fe tah a. Chun, David chu Keila khuoa inthawkin a tlân suok tah ti Saula an hril a; chuongchun, inthawk suok chu a ṭhul tah a."
14,"And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.","Chun, David chu thlalêrah, kul- bîng nghettakahai a um a, Ziph thlalêr tlâng ramah a um ta zing a. Chun, Saula chun ama chu ni tin hin a zawng a, nisienlakhawm, Pathienin a kutah a pêk nawh."
15,And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.,"Chun, David chun ama suk- hlum tumin Saula chu a hung inthawk ti a hriet a; chuongchun, David chu Ziph thlalêr Horeshah a um a."
16,"And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.","Chun, Saula naupa Jonathan chu a tho a, Horeshah David kuoma chun a feh a. Pathienah a kut chu a sukhrâtpêk a."
17,"And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.","Chun, a kuomah, “Ṭi dêr naw rawh, ka pa Saula kut chun zawng suok naw ni che; Israelhai lalah um i ta, kei nanga dawt nîng ka tih, chu khawm chu ka pa Saula hin a hriet zing a nih,” a ta. Chun, an pahni chun LALPA hmaa thu an thlung a;"
18,"And they two made a covenant before Jehovah: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.",David chu Horesha chun a um zing a; Jonathan ruok chu in tieng a fe tah a.
19,"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?","Chuongchun, Ziph mihai chu Gibea-ah Saula kuomah an hang feh a, “David chu kan kuomah Horesha kulbîngah, thlalêr simtieng pang Hakila tlângah ân bihmang zing a ni naw am a nih?"
20,"Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.","Chuleiin, aw lalpa, i hringnain hung thlâk a duthusâm ang ngei chun hung thla ta la, chun, keini lo thaw ve ding chu lal kuta ama lo inhlân chu nîng a ta,” an ta."
21,"And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have had compassion on me.","Chun, Saula chun, “LALPA chun malsâwm raw se cheu; nangni chun chu in mi lunginsiet hle a ni hi."
22,"Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly.","Fe unla, va sukchieng nâwkzuol unla, a hnung le hma va sui unla, chutaka a hmutu khawm va sukfel nâwkzuol zet zet ro: var vervêktakin thil a thaw hlak a nih ti miin an mi hril a nih."
23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.","Chuleiin, ân bîkhmangna hmun po pohai hre vawng bak unla, chun, ka kuomah hung nâwk ngei ngei unla: chun, nangni leh ka fe ve ding a nih: chun, hi ramah a um phawt chun Juda mi sâng tamtak laia inthawk chun zawng suok ka tih,” a ta."
24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.","Chun, an tho a, Saula fe hmain Zipha chun an fe tah a, nisienla- khawm, David le a mihai chu Jeshi- mon simtieng Arabaah Maon thla- lêra chun an um a."
25,"And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.","Chun, Saula le a mihai chu ama zawng dingin an feh a. Chun, David chu an hril a, chuongchun, Maon thlalêra um lungpui pan ding chun a suok a. Saulân chu chu a hriet chun Maon thlalêra chun David chu a hnawt tah a."
26,"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.","Saula chu tlâng khingtieng pangah a feh a, David le a mihai chu tlâng khingtieng panga chun an feh a, chun, David chu Saula ṭi chun inhmâwtakin a tlân a; Saula le a mihai chun David le a mihai chu man tumin an inhuol vêl sih a."
27,"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.","Nisienlakhawm, Saula kuoma chun, “Inhmaw la, hung rawh, Philistin mihai chun ei ram an hung thaw a nih,” tiin thangko a hung tlung a."
28,"So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.","Chuongchun, Saula chun David a hnawt lai chu a kîrsan a, Philistin mihai do ding chun a fe tah a: chuleiin, chu hmun chu Sela-hama- hlekoth an ti tah a."
29,"And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.","Chun, David chu chutaka in- thawk chu a feh a. En-gedi kul- bîngahai chun a hang um tah a."
