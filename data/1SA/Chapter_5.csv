1,"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.","Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun Pathien bâwm chu an lâk a, Ebenezera inthawk chun Asdod khuoah an fepui tah a."
2,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Pathien bâwm chu an lâk a, Dagon biekna inah an lâklût a, Dagon kâwla chun an sieh a."
3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.","Chun, Asdod khuoa mihai chun a zînga zîngkâr an hang tho chun, ngai ta, LALPA bâwm hmaa chun Dagon chu a hmaia hnuoi sikin a lo tlu dêr el a. Chun, Dagon chu an lâk a, a umna hmuna chun an sie nâwk a."
4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.","Chun, a zîngnâwk zîngkâr an hang tho chun, ngai ta, LALPA bâwm hmaa chun Dagon chu a hmaia hnuoi sikin a lo tlu dêr el a; Dagon lu le a kutpha bâwr khing hni bawng chu kawtkhâr bula chun a lo inhlum ngul el a; Dagon chu a taksa chau a lo um el tah a."
5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.","Chu chu lei chun Dagon thiempu amanih, Dagon biekna ina hung hlakhai hrim hrim khawmin Asdod khuoa Dagon kawtkhâr bul chu tu chen khawm hin an la sir ngam naw a nih."
6,"But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.","LALPA kut chun Asdod khuoa mihai chu a del ta hle el a, sietna ân tlungtirpêk tâwl tah a, Asdod khuo le a vêl khuohai chu ngâwtin a hrem ta bawk a."
7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.","Chuongchun, Asdod khuoa mi- haiin chuong ang chu a nih ti an lo hrietin, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm hi ei kuoma hin um zing da raw se ie, ei chunga le ei pathien Dagon chunga a kutthlâk a na em el,” an ta."
8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel thither.","Chuongchun, Philistin lal po pohai chu an kuomah an ko khâwm a, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm hi iengtin am ei thaw ding a na?” an ta. Anni chun, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm chu Gath khuoah va fepui ro,” tiin an dawn a; chuongchun, Israelhai Pathien bâwm chu an va fepui tah a."
9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them.","Chun, chuonga an fetlungpui chun, LALPA kut chun khuo chu a hung sukbuoi tah a, khuoa mi- hriemhai chu a chîn a lienin a hrem a, ngâwtna hri an chungah ân lêngtir a."
10,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.","Chuongchun, Pathien bâwm chu Ekronah an infetir a. Pathien bâwm chun Ekron a va tlung chun, Ekron khuoa mihai chu, “Israel- hai Pathien bâwm chu eini le ei mihai sukhlum dingin ei kuomah an hung lâk tah,” tiin an khêk ta rak el a."
11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.","Chuongchun, Philistin lalhai po po chu an ko khâwm a, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm hi infe hmangtir unla keini le kan mihai a mi sukhlum nawna dingin a umna hmun pângngaiah fe nâwk raw se,” an ta. Khaw pumpuia chun thina khawp buoina nasatak a um a; Pathien kut chun chu khuo chu a del hle sih a."
12,And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.,"A thi nawhai khawm chu ngâwtin an na tâwl a; chuongchun, chu khaw khêkri chun vân khi a hang tlung a."
