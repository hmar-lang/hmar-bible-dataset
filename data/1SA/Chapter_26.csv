1,"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?","Chun, Ziph mihai chu Gibeaa Saula kuomah an feh a, “David chu Jeshimon dep Hakila tlânga chun ân bihmang a ni naw am a nih?” tiin an va hril a."
2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.","Chuongchun, Saula chu a tho a, Ziph thlalêra chun Israel mihai laia thlang ṭhieu mi sâng thum ṭhuoiin Ziph thlalêra chun David zawng dingin a zu fe tah a."
3,"And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.","Chun, Saula chun Jeshimon dep, lam palailaka chun Hakila tlânga chun ṭhanghmun a khuor a. David ruok chu thlalêra chun a um zing a; chun, Saula chu ama zawng dingin thlalêra chun a hung ti a hriet a."
4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.","Chuleiin, David chun enthlit- tuhai a tir a, Saula chu a hung tak tak a nih ti a hriet chieng tah a."
5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.","Chuongchun, David chu a tho a, Saula ṭhanghmun khuornaa chun a feh a, chun David chun Saula le a sipai hotu Abner, Nera naupa zâlna chu a hmuh a; Saula chu tawlailîr huol sûnga chun a zâl a, a vêlin mihai chun umhmun an rem a."
6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.","Chuongchun, David chun Hit mi Ahimelek le Joab unau Zeruia naupa Abisai kuomah, “Saula ṭhanghmuna chun kei leh tu am fêng a ta?” a ta. Abisai chun, “Keima hi i kuoma chun zu fe vêng ka tih,” a ta."
7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.","Chuongchun, David le Abisai chu mipuihai umnaah zâna chun an zu feh a; chun, ngai ta, Saula chu tawlailîr huol sûnga chun a lo zâl a, a lu tieng chun a fei chu hnuoia hin a sunbûr a; chun, Abner le mihai chu a vêla chun an zâl a."
8,"Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.","Chuongchun, Abisai chun David kuomah, “Vawisûn hin i hmêlma chu Pathienin i kutah a pêk a ni hi, chuleiin, fei hin vawi khatin hnuoia hin hang sunde tlat el ka ti aw? Sun nawn nâwk naw tawp ka tih,” a ta."
9,"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah’s anointed, and be guiltless?","Nisienlakhawm, David chun Abisai kuomah, “Sukbohmang naw rawh, LALPA hrieknâl chunga kut thlâka thiem chang thei tu am um an ta?” a ta."
10,"And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.","Chun, David ma chun, “LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, LALPA chun a chungah kut thlâk naw nîm, an naw vêk leh a thi ni la hung tlung el a tih; a ni naw vêk leh indonaah fêng a ta, bohmang el a tih."
11,"Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed: but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.","LALPA hrieknâl chunga chun kut ka thlâk naw dingzie chu, a lu bula fei le tuiûm ruok kha chu la ta la aw, chuongchun, fe el ei tih,” a ta."
12,"So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s head; and they gat them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them.","Chuongchun, David chun Saula lu bula fei le tuiûm chu a lâk a, an fe nâwk tah a, tukhawmin an hmu nawh a, tukhawm a hrie le har an um bawk nawh a; LALPA chun inhnik- taka ân ininnghiltir tâwl leiin an in vawng a nih."
13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;","Chuongchun, David chu râl khingtieng chun a feh a, hla fea hin tlâng sîpah a ngîr a, an inkâr chu hlatak a nih."
14,"and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?","Chun, David chun mipuihai le Nera naupa Abner chu, “Abner, i mi hung dawn naw ding am a nih,” tiin a ko a. Chuongchun, Abner chun a dawn a, “Lal hung ko veitu chu tu am i ni leh?” a ta."
15,"And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.","Chun, David chun Abner kuoma chun, “Mi huoisen i ni naw am a nih? Israel mihai lai hin nang ang tu am an um a? Iengtiziea lal i pu chu i vêng naw am a na? Lal i pu chu sukbo- hmang dingin tu amanih a hung kha tie."
16,"This thing is not good that thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovah’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.","I thilthaw dân hi a ṭha naw a nih. LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, LALPA hrieknâl i pu chu i vêng ṭhat naw leiin thi el tlâk i nih. Lal lu thluona fei le tuiûm um kha khâw- lai am a um tah hang en ta hman,” a ta."
17,"And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.","Chun, Saula chun David râwl chu a hei hriet a, “Chu i râwl a ni maw ka naupa David,?” a hei tih a. David chun, “Aw lalpa, ka pu, ka râwl a ni chu,” a ta."
18,"And he said, Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?","Chun, “Ieng leiin am ka lalpa hin a siehlaw hi a hnawt a na? Ieng thil am ka thaw a? Ka kuta hin thil suol ieng am a um a?"
19,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah; for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.","Chuleiin, lalpa, ka pu chun a siehlaw thu hi ngai dingin ka hni che. Kei mi do dinga i lungril chawkthotu chu LALPA a ni chun thilinhlân chu pawm hrâm sienla; mihriem nauhai an ni ruok chun LALPA hmaah ṭawngsephurin um raw se, ‘Fe la, pathien danghai rawng bâwl rawh,’ tiha LALPA ro ka hluo thei nawna dinga vawisûn hin an mi hnawt hmang ka ni sih a."
20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.","Chuleiin, ka thisen chu LALPA hmu phâk nawah hnuoi chungah luong naw raw se; varung pêl dinga mihai chu tlânga chun an raminvâk angin Israel lal chu uihrik chau zawng dingin a fe suok a ni hi,” a ta."
21,"Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.","Chuongchun, Saula chun, “Thil ka lo thaw suol dêr el a nih, ka naupa David, hung kîr nâwk rawh, i mithmuah ka hringna hi vawisûn hin a hlut êm leiin iengkhawm law ta naw hrim hrim ka ti che, ngai ta, thil invêtthlâktak ka lo thaw tah a, ka lo thaw suol dêr el a ni ta hi,” a ta."
22,"And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.","Chun, David chun a dawn a, “Aw lalpa, fei hi hei en ta, tlangvâl pakhat hung sienla hung la raw se."
23,"And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed.","Chun, LALPA chun mi tin an fel man le an ringumna man a pêk ding a na, vawisûn hin LALPA chun nang hi ka kutah a pêk che deh a chu LALPA hrieknâl chungah ka kut kân let nuom naw a nih."
24,"And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.","Ngai ta, vawisûna i hringna ka ngaihlutpêk che ang bawk hin LALPA chun ka hringna hi mi ngaihlupêk sienla, lunginzîngna po poa inthawk hin mi sansuok raw se,” a ta."
25,"Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.","Chuongchun, Saula chun David kuomah, “Ka naupa David, mal- sâwmin um raw khai, thilthawthei- takin um i ta, hne pei i tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chu a feh a, chun, Saula khawm chu ama hmun tieng chun a fe ve tah a."
