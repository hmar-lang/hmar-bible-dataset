1,"Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?","Chuongchun, Samuel chun hriek bâwm chu a hung lâk suok a, a lua chun a bur a, a fâwp a, “LALPA chun a rochan hai chunga hotu dingin hriek a nâl che a ni naw am a nih? LALPA mipuihai chungah ro rêl i ta, an vêla an hmêlmahai kuta inthawkin sandam i tih. Chun, hi hi LALPAIN a rochanhai chunga hotu dingin a ruot che ti inchikna chu ning a tih."
2,"When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?","Vawisûn hin i mi fesan hnungin, Zelzaah Benjamin ramria Rakil thlân kâwlah mi pahni hmûng i ta; chun, anni chun i kuomah, Sabengtung i zawnghai kha an hmu tah ie; chun, ngai ta, i pa chun sabengtung chu a ngaituo ta nawh a, nangma mawl a ngaituoh a, ‘Ka naupa chu iengtin am ka thaw ding a ni ta leh aw, a ti a ti el a,’ tîng an ta."
3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun fe pei la, Tabor thingsaisuo chu va tlung i ta, chutaka chun mi pathum, Bethela Pathien kuoma hang fe dinghaiin lo intuokpui an ti cheh a; pakhat chun kêlte pathum pawm a ta, pakhat chun beiphêk pathum chawi a ta, chun, pakhat chun uoin peng chawi bawk a tih."
4,"and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive of their hand.","Chun, chibai bûk an ti cheh a, beiphêk chu phêk hni pêng an ti cheh a; chu chu lâng i ta."
5,"After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:","Chu hnunga chun Philistin sipai- hai umna Pathien tlâng chu va tlung i ta, chun, chutaka khuo i va tlung chun zâwlneihai perkhuong dâm, khuongtê dâm, theihle dâm, ṭingṭang dâm chawihai hma ṭhuoia bâwl- hmuna inthawka hung thla intuok- pui i ta; chun, thu hril duol duol an ta;"
6,"and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.","chun, LALPA thlarau nasatakin i chungah hung tlung a ta, nang khawm thu an hril duol duolnaa chun ṭhang vêng i ta, chun, mi danglam daiah inchang el i tih."
7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.","Chun, hieng inchiknahai hi i chunga a hung um pha chun thil hung umin a zir ang peiin i thaw ding a nih; Pathien chu i kuomah a um pei sih a."
8,"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.","Chun, ka fe hma hin Gilgala chun lo zu fe la, chun, ngai ta, kei khawm pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai le in- remna inthâwinahai inhlân dingin i kuomah hung thlâng ka ta; i kuoma ka hung a, i thaw ding ka hung hril hma che chun ni sari i lo um ding a nih,” a ta."
9,"And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.","Chun, Samuel chu ṭhe dinga a hnungnghat phingleh Pathien chun lungril danglam dai a pêk tah a; chun, chuong inchiknahai po po chu chu ni chun a hung tlung ta vawng a."
10,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.","Chuongchun, tlâng chu an hang tlung chun, ngai ta, zâwlneihai chun an intuokpui a; chun LALPA thlarau nasatakin a hung tlung a; thu an hril duol duolnaa chun a ṭhang ve tah a."
11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?","Chun, kha hmaa ama lo hre hlakhaiin zâwlneihai thu hril duol duolnaah a ṭhang ve ti an hriet chun mihai chu an inbiek a, “Kis naupa chunga thil hung um hi ieng am a ni ta leh? Saula khawm chu zâwlneihai lai a ṭhang ve am a ni el tah?” an ta."
12,"And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?","Chun, a umna khuoa mi pakhatin a dawn a, “An pa chu tu am a ni bîk leh?” an ta. Chuongchun, “Saula khawm chu zâwlnei a ni ve el ta a ni maw chu?” ti chu ṭawngna takah an hmang ta zing a."
13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.","Chun, an thu hril duol duolnaa a ṭhang zo chun bâwlhmun chu a tlung tah a."
14,"And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.","Chun, Saula pami chun a kuoma le a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Khâwlai am in feh a?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Sabengtung kan zawng a nih, chun, kan hmu zo naw phingleh Samuel kuomah kan fe a nih,” a ta."
15,"And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.","Saula pami chun, “Samuel chun i kuomah ieng am a na a hril mi hril raw khai,” a ta."
16,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.","Saula chun a pami kuoma chun, “Sabengtunghai chu an hmu tah ti a mi hril ngei kha tie,” a ta. Amiruok- chu, ram chungchâng thu Samuelin a hril chu a hril nawh a."
17,And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah;,"Chuongchun, Samuel chun mi- puihai chu Mizpaa chun LALPA kuomah a ko khâwm a;"
18,"and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:","Israel thlahai kuoma chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘Israelhai chu Aiguptaa inthawkin ka ṭhuoi suok a, Aigupta mihai kuta inthawk le, a hnuoisietuhai cheu ram po poa in- thawkin ka sansuok cheu a."
19,"but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.","Nisienlakhawm, vawisûn hin in lunginzîngna po po le in rinumna po poa sanhimtu cheu in Pathien ngei chu in dit nawh a, a kuomah, A ni nawh, lal mi siempêk rawh’ in tih a. Chuleiin, tuhin a hnama hnam le a chia chiin LALPA hmaah hung inlang ro,” a ta."
20,"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.","Chuongchun, Samuel chun Israel chi po po chu a hung inlangtir a, chun, Benjamin chi chu thlang a lo ni tah a."
21,"And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.","Chun, Benjamin chihai chu a sûngkuoin a hung inlangtir a, Matri mi sûngkuo chu thlang an lo ni tah a; chun, Kis naupa Saula chu thlang a lo ni tah a, nisienlakhawm, ama chu an hang zawng a, an hmu nawh a."
22,"Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.","Chuongchun, LALPA chu an hang indawn nâwk a, “Mi dang la hung ding an um am?” an ta. Chun, LALPA chun a dawn a, “Ngai ta u, thuomhnaw lai ân bihmang a nih,” a ta."
23,"And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.","Chuongchun, an tlân a, an va ṭhuoi suok a; chun, mipui lai a hang ngîr chun mi lai chun ân sâng tak el a, mi dang hrim hrim a liengko nêka insâng khawm an um nawh a."
24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, Long live the king.","Chun, Samuel chun mi po po kuomah, “LALPA mi ruot hi in hmu am? Mipuihai po po lai ama ang hrim hrim an um nawh,” a ta. Chun, mipuihai chu an khêk a, “Pathienin laltak chu humhim raw se,” an ta."
25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.","Chuongchun, Samuel chun mi- puihai chu ram umdân ding chu a hril a, lekhabuah a ziek a, LALPA hmaa chun a sieh a. Chun, Samuel chun mipuihai chu mâni in tieng seng ân ṭintir tah a."
26,"And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.","Saula khawm chu Gibea khuoha a in tieng a fe tah a; mi huoisenhai, an lungril Pathienin a tâwkhai, chu a kuomah an fe veh a."
27,"But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.","Amiruokchu, Belial nauhai tu- haiin amani ruok chun, “Hi mipa hin iengtin am mi sandam thei hlak a ta?” an ta. Chuongchun, ama chu an ngainêp a, thilpêk hrim hrim an pêk nuom nawh a. Nisienlakhawm, ama chu a to zing a."
