1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?","Chuongchun, David chu Nob khuoa thiempu Ahimelek kuoma chun a feh a, chun, Ahimelek chun inthin pumin David chu a lo tuok a, a kuomah, “Iengtizie am a na, i va mal de, fe pui i nei nawh a?” a lo tih a."
2,"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.","David chun, thiempu Ahimelek kuoma chun, “Lalin thil thaw dingin thu a mi pêk a, ka kuomah, ‘Ka thil inthawtir tum che le ka thupêk hrim hrim che hi tukhawma hre naw raw se,’ a ti tlat a; chun, tlangvâlhai lo umna ding hmunhai chu ka ruot a."
3,"Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.","Chuongchun, ieng ieng am i kutah a um a? Bei tlang nga mi pe la, annawleh, i nei ang taphawt khawm chu,” a ta."
4,"And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.","Chun, thiempu chun David chu a dawn a, “Bei narân chu ka nei nawh a, bei inthieng ruok chu ka nei a; tlangvâlhai chu nuhmeia inthawka an insiekieng phawt chun,” a ta."
5,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day shall their vessels be holy?","Chun, David chun thiempu chu a dawn a, a kuomah, “Tuta ni thum sûng hin chu nuhmeia inthawk hrim hrim chu kan insiekieng vawng a nih, ka hung suok ding lai khawm khan tlangvâlhai bûrlebêl chu ân thieng a nih, invâk satlie el kan ni nâka chu; vawisûn lem chu chu an bûrlebêlhai chu a vân thieng nâwkzuol awm de e!” a ta."
6,"So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.","Chuongchun, thiempu chun, bei inthieng chu a pêk tah a; chutaka chun entirna bei an lâk nia bei luma thleng dinga LALPA hmaa inthawka an lâk chau naw chu bei dang a um si nawh a."
7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.","Chun, chu ni chun Saula siehlaw laia mi pakhat LALPA hmaa hrên a um a, a hming chu Doeg a nih, Edom mi, Saula ran vêngtuhai laia hotu tak a nih."
8,"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.","Chun, David chun Ahimelek kuoma chun, “Fei amanih, kâwlhnâm amanih i kawl naw maw? Lal hmaa chun inhmaw a ṭûl leiin ka kâwlhnâm le ka hriemhrei a ieng khawm ka hung chawi hman naw a nih,” a ta."
9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.","Chun, thiempu chun, “Philistin mi Goliath, Ela ruoma i thatpa kâwlhnâm chu ngai ta, thiempu zakawsîng hliea sawn puona tuomin a um zing el, chu chu i lâk nuom chun la rawh; chu chau naw chu a dang a um nawh,” a ta. David chun, “Chu bâk chu ie, mi pe raw khai,” a ta."
10,"And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.","Chun, David chu a tho a, chu ni chun Saula ṭi chun a tlân hmang a, Gath lal Akis kuomah a fe tah a."
11,"And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?","Chun, Akis siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Hi hi an ram lal David a ni naw am a ni kha? ‘Saulain a sânga sâng a that a, Davidin a sînga sîng a that a,’ tiha lâm pumin a chungchâng thu hlain an sak dur dur a ni naw am a ni kha?” an ta."
12,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.","Chun, David chun chuong thuhai chu a lungrilah a pai tah a, Gath lal Akis chu a ṭi ta hle el a."
13,"And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.","Chuongchun, a hmaa chun a um dân a sukdanglam a, an mithmua chun invêt tehlêm a thaw ta rak el a, kawtkhâr dâm chu a kei rak rak a, a khâkhmula dâm chun a chil a sukluong ta neng nung a."
14,"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad; wherefore then have ye brought him to me?","Chuongchun, Akis chun a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “En ta u, invêt a ni in hriet zing sih a, iengdinga ka kuoma in hung ṭhuoi am a na?"
15,"Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?",Invêt ka tlâksam leiin am a nih hi mi hi ân vêtzie suklang dinga ka hmaa in hung ṭhuoi chu? Ama hi ka inah a hung lût el ding maw?” a ta.
