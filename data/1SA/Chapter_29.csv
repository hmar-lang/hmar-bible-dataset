1,Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.,"Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun an sipaihai po po chu Apheka chun an ko khâwm vawng a; chun, Israel mihai chun Jezreela tui- khur kâwlah ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.","Chun, Philistinhai lalhai chu sâng têl têl dâmin, za têl têl dâmin an fe zut zut el a."
3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away unto me unto this day?","Chun, David le a mihai le Akis le chun hnung an dâl a. Chuongchun, Philistin lalhai chun, “Hieng Hebrai mihai hi ieng thaw am an ni leh?” an ta. Akis chun Philistin lalhai kuoma chun, “Hi David, Israelhai lal Saula siehlaw, hi chen rau ka kuoma um ta a, ka kuoma a hung tlûklûta in- thawka tu chen khawma a suolna ka hmu nawna chu a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
4,"But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for wherewith should this fellow reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?","Nisienlakhawm, Philistin lalhai chu a chungah an lunginsen a, a kuomah, “Ama chu i hmun ruotpêka khan kîr nâwk dingin infetir la, indonaah kan kuoma chun fe ve naw raw se; chuong naw chun indonaah ei hmêlmahai tieng ṭhang el rawi a tih; hieng mihai luhai laia ding hin hi mipa hi a lalpa leh an inrem nâwk el âwm deh aw?"
5,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?","Hi David hi a ni naw am a nih lâm puma: ‘Saulain a sânga sâng a that a, Davidin a sînga sîng a that a,’ tiha a chungchâng thu hlaa an sak kha?” an ta."
6,"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.","Chuongchun, Akis chun David chu a ko a, a kuomah, “LALPA hring- na sâlin ka hril a nih, mi indiktak i lo na, sipaihai lai ka kuoma i fea i hung hlak chu ka mithmua chun a ṭha hle el a; ka kuoma i hung nia inthawk vawisûn chen hin i chungah ieng- khawm ṭhat nawna hrim hrim ka hmu dêr nawh a; nisienlakhawm, lal- hai rawi hin an ngaina naw che a nih."
7,"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.","Chuleiin, Philistin lalhai i suk- lungninaw nawna dingin kîr nâwk la, lungâwitakin fe el rawh,” a ta."
8,"And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?","David chun Akis kuomah, “Anleh ieng thil am ka lo thaw leh? i kuoma ka um sûng po vawisûn chen hin, ka pu, laltak hmêlma chu do loa ka hang kîr nâwk elna dingin i siehlaw chung- a hin ieng am hriet i nei leh?” a ta."
9,"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.","Akis chun a dawn a, David kuom- ah, “Ka mithmua chun Pathien vântirko ang elin i ṭhah a, nisien- lakhawm, Philistin lalhai hin, ‘Indonaah kan kuomah hung ve naw nih,’ an ti tlat el a."
10,"Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.","Chuleiin, i kuoma fe ve, i pu siehlawhai le hin zîngkâr tho unla, chun, zîngkâr in tho a, khuo a var phing le chun fe el ro,” a ta."
11,"So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.","Chuongchun, David le a mihai chu Philistin rama kîr dinga zîngkâra suok dingin zîngkâr an tho tah a. Chun, Philistin mihai chu Jezreelah an hang fe tah a."
