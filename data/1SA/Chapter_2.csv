1,"And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in Jehovah; My horn is exalted in Jehovah; My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; Because I rejoice in thy salvation.","Hanna chu a ṭawngṭai a, “LALPA chungah ka lungril a lâwm êm êm a; Ka ki chu LALPAA chawimawiin a um a; Ka hmêlmahai chungah ka bau suklienin a um a, I sandamnaa chun ka lâwm êm êm leiin."
2,"There is none holy as Jehovah; For there is none besides thee, Neither is there any rock like our God.",LALPA anga inthieng hi an um nawh; Nangma ang hrim an um si nawh; Ei Pathien ang lungpui hrim a um bawk nawh;
3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, And by him actions are weighed.","Chuong ang taka chapo chun thu hril ta naw unla, In baua inthawkin ṭawng chapo hrim hrim suok naw raw se; LALPA chu varna Pathien a ni sih a, Ama chun thilthawhai chu a bûk fie hlak."
4,The bows of the mighty men are broken; And they that stumbled are girded with strength.,"Mi hrât thalngulhai a sukthliek a, A kathai kâwng chu hrâtnaa khitin a um a,"
5,"They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; And they that were hungry have ceased to hunger: Yea, the barren hath borne seven; And she that hath many children languisheth.","Khawp hlakhai chu fâk ding zawngin an inhlawfa tah a, Phîngṭâm hlakhai chu an phîng a ṭâm ta nawh a; Anih, ching chun pasari a nei tah a, Nau tamtak neinu chu a châu tah,"
6,"Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive: He bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.","LALPA chun a sukhlum hlak a, a sukhring bawk hlak, Thlânah ân fe thlâktir hlak a, a ṭhuoi suok bawk hlak."
7,"Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich: He bringeth low, he also lifteth up.","LALPA chun a sukpase hlak a, a sukhausa bawk hlak, A suktlâwm hlak a, a chawisâng bawk hlak."
8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, And inherit the throne of glory: For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah’s, And he hath set the world upon them.","Pilvuta inthawkin pasie chu a keitho hlak a, Pasie chu êkdûra inthawkin a chawikâng hlak, Mi lienhai kuomah ân umtir theina ding le, Ropuina lalṭhungpha an chang theina dingin, Leihnuoi innghatsan chu LALPA ta a nih; Khawvêl chu a chungah ân nghat ta sih a."
9,He will keep the feet of his holy ones; But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For by strength shall no man prevail.,"A mi inthieng ke chu vêng a ta, Mi suolhai ruok chu inthim hnuoiah sukdei ṭhapin um an tih; Hrâtna chun tukhawma an ngam âwm si nawh a."
10,"They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; Against them will he thunder in heaven: Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; And he will give strength unto his king, And exalt the horn of his anointed.","LALPA insuolpuihai chu kawinawiin um an ta, Vâna inthawka vâninrûmin do a ta; LALPA chun kâwlkawdawng chenin rorêl a tih; A lal chu hrâtna pêng a ta, A hrieknâl ki chu chawimawi a tih,” a ta."
11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto Jehovah before Eli the priest.,"Chuongchun, Elkana chu Rama khuoa a ina chun a fe nâwk tah a. Chun, naupang chun thiempu Eli hmaa chun LALPA rawng chu a bâwl tah a."
12,Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.,"Eli naupasalhai chu Belial nauhai an na, LALPA chu an hriet nawh a."
13,"And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;","Chun, mipuihai laia thiempu- hai thaw dân chu, miin inthâwina an hung inhlân hin, sa suong laitak hin thiempu siehlaw hi sa thurna thîrkut zum thum nei mi chawiin a hung hlak a;"
14,"and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.","chun, bêl bau lien amanih, bêl dâwt nei amanih, bêl khaina nei amanih, bêl amani sûng chu a zuk sun a; chun, chu sa thurna inzumin a hung thur suok po po chu thiempu chun a lâk hlak a nih. Chuong ang chun Israel mihai chutaka hung po pohai chu Silo khuoa chun an lo thawpêk hlak a."
15,"Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.","Anih, a thâu chu an raw hma chun thiempu siehlaw chu a hung a, ân thâwitu kuoma chun, “Thiempu ta dinga emhmin ding sa mi pe rawh, i sa suong chu a du nawh a, a sel a dit a nih,” a ti hlak a."
16,"And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “A thâu chu raw phawt el sienla; chun, chu zova chun i hringnain a dit zât zât i lâk ding annâwm,” a lo ti chun, “Ni lo, i mi pêk naw chun la lui hrim hrim ka tih,” a ti hlak a."
17,And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, tlangvâlhai suol- na chu LALPA mithmuah a lo nasa ta êm êm el a, mihai chun LALPA kuoma inthâwina inhlânhai chu an ngainêp pha ta sih a."
18,"But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.","Samuel chu naupang ni sien khawm, puon zai inhmi zakawsîng hâkin LALPA hmaah rawng a bâwl a."
19,"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.","Chu naw khawm chu a nuin zakawfuol chîn a ṭhuipêk a, kum tina an inthâwina inhlân dinga a pasal kuoma a fe ve hin a chawipêk hlak a."
20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went unto their own home.","Chun, Eli chun Elkana le a nu- hmei chu mal a sâwmpêk a, “LALPA ta dinga in thilinhlân in inhlân hi, hi nuhmei thla hin LALPA chun thung raw se cheu,” a ta. Chuongchun, in tieng an fe tah a."
21,"And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA chun Hanna chu a hung sir a, nau a vawn a, naupasal pathum le naunuhmei pahni a nei a. Chun, naupang Samuel chu LALPA hmaa chun a hung inṭhanglien tah a."
22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.",Eli chu a hung tar ta hle el a; Israel mihai po po chunga a nauhai thilthaw po po le inbiekna puon in kawtkhâr bula rawngbâwltu nuhmei- hai an lo zâlpui hlak thu dâm a lo hriet a.
23,"And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.","Chuongchun, an kuomah, “Iengdinga hieng ang thil hi in thaw am a na? Mi po pohaia inthawk hin in thilthaw ṭha nawhai chu ka lo hriet a nih."
24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah’s people to transgress.","Ni lo, ka naupasalhai, in chanchin ka lo hriet hi a ṭha naw tieng ruok a nih; LALPA mihai chu in inbawsiettir a nih."
25,"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because Jehovah was minded to slay them.","Mi pakhat mi dang chunga a suol chu Pathienin rorêlpêk a ta, amiruokchu mi, LALPA chungah a suol ruok chun tuin am ngênpui tâng a ta?” a ta. Chuong sa khawm chun an pa râwl chu an ngai nuom nawh a, LALPA chun anni chu a sukhlum ngei ding a ni sih a."
26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.","Chun, naupang Samuel chu ân ṭhanglien deu deu a, Pathien le mihriemhai dit zâwngin a um tah a."
27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?","Chun, Eli kuoma chun Pathien mi pakhat a hung a, a kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Aigupta rama Pharao suoka an um lai khan in thlatu kuoma khan kân lâr a ni naw am a nih?"
28,"and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?","Chun, Israel hnam po po laia ka mâichâma hang fe a, riminhnik raw a, ka hmaa zakawsîng hâk dingin ka thiempu dingin ama chu ka ruot a ni naw am a nih? I thlatuhai chu Israel mihai pumrawhmang thil inhlân po po ka pêk a ni naw am a nih?"
29,"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?","Ieng leiin am ka umnaa inhlân dinga ka ruot ka kuoma inthâwina le ka puola thil inhlân chu in sirde a, keia nêka i nauhai i chawimawi lem a, nangni insukthâuna dinga ka mi Israelhai inthâwina a ṭha ṭha in hmang am a na?’ tiin."
30,"Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.","Chuleiin, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun, ‘Kei chun chu i sûnghai le i pa sûnghai chu kumkhuoin ka hmaah um in tih’ ka ti ngei a; nisienlakhawm, tuhin LALPA chun, ‘Um naw tawp in tih, a mi chawimawi taphawt chu chawimawi ka ta, a mi hmusit taphawt chu ka ngainêp an ni ding a ni sih a."
31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.","Ngai ta, i bân dâm, i pa sûng- hai bân dâm ka tan ni ding chu a hung tlung ding a ni tah; i inah tarkûna dam hrim hrim um naw ni hai."
32,"And thou shalt behold the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.","Pathienin Israelhai chu hauna a pêk pha chun nang chun ka umnaa tuorna la hmûng i ta; chun, i ina chun kumkhawtluongin tarkûna dam hrim hrim um naw ni hai."
33,"And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.","Chun, i mi, ka mâichâma inthawka ka sukbohmang naw ding hai chu i mit sukkhamtu le I lungril suknatu nîng an ta; i ina hung pienghai taphawt chu an vânglai takin thi pei an tih."
34,"And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.","Chun, hi hi, i naupasalhai pahni Hophni le Phinehas chunga thil hung tlung ding chu i ta dingin inchikna nîng a tih; ni khat sûngin an pahniin thi ve vêng an tih."
35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.","Chun, thiempu ringumtak ka ta dingin indin ṭha nâwk ka ta, ama chun chu ka lungril le ka lung tuok- zâwngin thâwng a tih. Chun, sûng- kuo dettakah inngîr ka ta, kum- khuoin ka hriek nâl hmaa chun um a tih."
36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.","Chun, i ina la um po pohai chu tangka le bei hni dingin fêng an ta, ama chibai bûk an tih, bei tlâwmte bêk ka hmu theina dingin thiempu sin mîn thawtir raw khai, tîng an tih,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
