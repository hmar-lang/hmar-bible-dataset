1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.","Benjamin rama Benjamin thlaa mi mi pakhat mi hrât huoisen a um a, a hming chu Kis a nih; ama chu Abiel naupa a na, ama chu Zeror naupa a na, ama chu Bekorath naupa a na, ama chu Aphia naupa a nih."
2,"And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a young man and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.","Chun, ama chun naupa a nei a, a hming chu Saula a nih; tlangvâl pieng ṭhatak a na, Israel mihai laia chun ama nêka pieng ṭha hrim hrim an um nawh a, a liengko nêka insâng mi dang hrim hrim an um nawh."
3,"And the asses of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.","Chun, Saula pa Kis sabengtung- hai chu ân hmang tâwl a. Chuong- chun, Kis chun a naupa Saula kuoma chun, “Tho la, siehlaw pakhat ṭhuoi la, sabengtunghai va zawng raw khai,” a ta."
4,"And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.","Chuongchun, Ephraim tlâng ram dâm chu a fang a, chun Salisa ram dâm khawm chu a fang a, nisien- lakhawm, a hmu nawh a; chun, Saalim ram an fang nâwk a, chutaka khawm chun an um nawh a; chun, Benjamin mihai ram an fang nâwk a, nisienlakhawm, an hmu chuong ta nawh a."
5,"When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the asses, and be anxious for us.","Zuph ram an tlung chun, Saula chun a kuoma um ve, a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Hung rawh, kîr nâwk el tâng ei tih, chuong naw chun, ka pa khan sabengtunghai ngaituo ṭhulin eini mi ngaituo lem a tih,” a ta."
6,"And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, hi khuoa hin Pathien mi a um a, mi inzaumtak a na, a hril taphawt chu a hung tlung ngei ngei hlak a nih, hung rawh, chutaka chun va fêng ei tih, ei fena dâm hi a mi hril thei miel rawi mawh,” a ta."
7,"Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?","Chuongchun, Saula chun a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Anachu, fe ta ang ni inla, ama chu ieng am chawipêk ei ta? Ei bâwma bei hlak a um ta si nawh a. Pathien mi ta dinga lâwmman chawi ding a um dêr nawh, ieng am ei nei aw?” a ta."
8,"And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.","Siehlaw chun Saula chu a dawn nâwk a, “Ngai ta, tangka Shekel hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat ka la chawi a, chu chu ei fena ding a mi hril manah Pathien mi chu pe el ka tih,” a ta."
9,"(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)","(Kha hma khan chu Israelhai lai khan miin Pathien an râwn nuom chun, “Hung rawh, hmutheitu kuomah fêng ei tih,” an ti hlak a; tulaia Zâwlnei an ti hlak hi, kha hma khan chu Hmutheitu an ti hlak a nih.)"
10,"Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.","Chun, Saula chun a siehlaw kuoma chun, “A ṭha hlau chu, fe ta nâwm ei nîm”, a ta. Chuongchun, Pathien mi umna khuoa chun an fe tah a."
11,"As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?","Khaw hang pannaa an hang fe lai chun nunghâk tui chawi dinga hung suokhai an hmuh a, an kuomah, “Hitaka hin Hmutheitu chu a um am?” an ta."
12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before thee: make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place.","Anni chun an dawn a, “Um e, in hmaa khan a hung a nih, inhmaw ro khai, vawisûn hin khuoah a hung a nih, vawisûn hin bâwlhmunahai mihai an inthâwi a nih,"
13,"As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him.","khuo in hang lût hlimin bâwlhmuna bu fa dinga a fe hmain hang hmu nghâl el in tih; in- thâwina malsâwmtu ding a ni leiin a tlung hmakhat chu mipui chun bu an fâk naw ding a nih, chu hnunga chun an mi fielhai chun an fâk hlak a nih. Chuleiin, hang fe vak unla, hang hmu nghâl el in tih,” an ta."
14,"And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.","Chuongchun, khuoa chun an hang fe tah a. Khuo an hang lût chun, Samuel bâwlhmuna fe ding chun ân tuokpui a."
15,"Now Jehovah had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,","Chun, Saula hung hma ni khata chun LALPA chun Samuel chu a lo hril rûk a,"
16,"To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.","“Zîngah hieng ang hun lai hin Benjamin rama inthawkin i kuomah mi pakhat ka hung tir ding a na, ka mi Israel chunga hotu ni dingin hriek nâl i ta, ama chun Philistin mihai kuta inthawkin ka mihai sandam a tih; an khêkri chun ka kuom a hung tlung ta leiin ka mihai chu ka ngaisak tah a nih,” tiin."
17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said unto him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people.","Chun, Samuelin Saula a hmu chun, LALPAIN a kuomah, “En ta, i kuoma ka mi hril kha, ama hin ka mihai chungah thu nei a tih,” a ta."
18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.","Chuongchun, Saula chun kul kawtkhâra chun Samuel chu a va hnai a, “Hmutheitu in chu khâwlai am a na, mi hril ta,” a ta."
19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.","Samuel chun Saula chu a dawn a, “Keima hi hmutheitu chu ka nih, ka hmaa hin bâwlhmun tieng panin fe la, vawisûn hin ka kuomah bu i fâk ve ding a nih; chun, zîngah zîngkâr infetir ka ti cheh a, i lungrila um po po khawm hril ka ti che."
20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father’s house?","I sabengtung ni thum inhmang tahai chu lungkham naw rawh, an hmu tah. Israelhai laia ropuina po po chu tu ta ding am a na? I ta ding le i pa ina mi po pohai ta ding a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
21,"And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?","Saula chun a dawn a, “Israel hnam laia chîntak, Benjamin hnam ka ni naw am a nih? Chun, kan sûngkuo khawm Benjamin hnam sûngkuo lai po poa chîntak a ni naw am a nih? iengtiziea ka kuoma hienga hril am i nih a?” a ta."
22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.","Samuel chun Saula le a siehlaw chu a ṭhuoi a, mikhuol pindana chun a ṭhuoi lût a, an mi fiel sâwmthumhai lai chun hmun ropuitaka chun ân ṭhungtir a."
23,"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.","Chun, Samuel chun bu suongtu kuoma chun, “I kuoma sietum ding ka ti, chanvo ka pêk che kha hung la raw khai,” a ta."
24,"And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold, that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.","Chuongchun, bu suongtu chun a mal le a chunga um chu a hung lâk a, Saula hmaa chun a va sieh a. Chun, Samuel chun, “En ta, ka lo sietum hi! awt la fa rawh khai, hi huna dingin hi hi kan lo ruotpêk hrim che a nih, ‘Mi dâm ka fiel khâwm ie,’ ka ti bawk sih a,” a ta. Chuongchun, chu ni chun Saula chu Samuel hai le chun bu thlêng chu an awt hmunkhat tah a."
25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop.","Chun, bâwlhmuna inthawka khuoa an fe thla chun in chungah Saula chu zâlna an siempêk a; a zâl tah a."
26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.","Chun, zîngkâr chun a tho a, nisa suok ding lai vêlin Samuel chun in chunga um Saula chu a ko a, “Tho la, infetir tâng ka ti che,” a ta. Chuongchun, Saula chu a tho a, ama le Samuel chu an fe suok tah a."
27,"As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.","Khaw hmawrtâwng chu an zuk tlung chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “Siehlaw hi ei hma tieng infetir la, (ama chu a fe tah a) nang ruok chu ngîr hri la, Pathien thu hang hril hri phawt ka ti che,” a ta."
