1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.","Chun, Saula kuoma thu a hril zo chun Jonathan hringna le David hringna chu a lo inzawm ta chie el a, chuongchun, Jonathan chun ama hringna a hmangai ang chiein a hmangai tah a."
2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.","Chun, Saula chun chu ni chun ân umtir ta nghâl a, a pa ina chun ân fetir phal ta nawh a."
3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.","Chuongchun, Jonathan le David chun thu an thlung a, ama hringna ang chiea a hmangai leiin."
4,"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.","Chun, Jonathan chun a puon sil lai a hlîp a, David chu a pêk a, a thuom le a kâwlhnâm le a thalngul le a kâwng khitna chenin a pêk a."
5,"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.","Chun, Saula chun a tirna ta- phawta chun David chu a fe hlak a, feltakin a châng pei a; chun, Saula chun râl kâp mihai hotu dingin a siem a, chu chu mi po po ngaia le Saula siehlawhai ngaia khawm a ṭha êm êm a."
6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.","Chun, an hung inlawi a, Philistin mi thata David a hung kîr chun Israel khaw tinah, nuhmeihai hla sak le lâm pumin khuongtê le thil inri theihai leh, hlimtakin lal Saula tuok dingin an hung suok a."
7,"And the women sang one to another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.","Chun, nuhmeihai chun lâm pum- in hlain an indawn tuoh a. “Saulain a sânga sâng a that a, Davidin a sînga sîng a that a,” an tih a."
8,"And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?","Chuongchun, Saula chu a lung- insen ta vieu el a, chuong thu chun ama a suklâwm naw hle el a, “David chu a sînga sîng thatah an ngai a, kei ruok chu a sânga sâng chau thatah an mi ngai a: ram ti chau lo chu ieng am a nei ding dang a um ta leh?” a ta."
9,And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.,"Chuongchun, chu nia inthawk chun Saula chun David chu a hmusiet tah a."
10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;","Chun, a zînga chun Pathien tir khawhri Saula chunga chun a hung tlung ta rak el a, in sûnga chun thu chu a hril ta nuk nuk el a, chun, David chun ni danga a thaw dân ang bawkin ṭingṭang a kei a: Saula chun a fei chu a chawi zing a."
11,"and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.","Chun, Saula chun fei chu a hang inlet a, “Banga sawn David khâw de tlat ka tih,” a ta. David chun vawi hni ân kiensan a."
12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.","Chun, a kuoma LALPA a um lei le, Saula chu a fesan leiin Saula chun David chu a ṭih a."
13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.","Chuleiin, Saula chun a kuoma inthawkin ân sawntir a, sâng chunga sipai hotuah a siem a, chun, mipuihai lai chun a lûtin a suok hlak."
14,And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.,"Chun, David chu a thilthaw taphawtah feltakin a châng hlak a, LALPA chu a kuomah a um a."
15,"And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.","Chun, Saula chun feltakin a châng hlak ti a hmuin a ṭi hle el a."
16,But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.,"Nisienlakhawm, Israelhai le Judahai po po chun David chu an ngaina êm êm a, anni laia lûta suok hlak a ni sih a."
17,"And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah’s battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.","Chun, Saula chun David kuom- ah, “Ngai ta, ka naunuhmei upa lem Merab hi nuhmeiah inneitir ka ti che, huoitakin mi ṭan phawt el la. LALPA indonahai chu do rawh,” a ta. Saula chun, “Kei chun chu a chunga hin kutthlâk loin, Philistin mihaiin thlâk lem raw se,” a ti a nih."
18,"And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?","Chun, David chun Saula kuom- ah, “Tu am ka na, ka hringna le Israelhai lai ka pa sûnghai chu ieng am an na, lal mâkpa ka hang nina san ding chu?” a ta."
19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.","Nisienlakhawm, Saula naunu Merab chu David inneitir a hung hun chun Meholath mi Adriel nuhmei dingin a pêk ta el a."
20,"And Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.","Chun, Saula naunu Mikal chun David chu a hmangai a, Saula chu an hril a, chu chun a suklâwm a."
21,"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time.","Chun, Saula chun, “A âwkna châng a hung ni theina dingin le Philistin mihaiin a chunga kut an thlâk theina dingin ama hi pêng ka tih,” a ta. Chuleiin, Saula chun David kuoma a vawi hninaah chun, “Vawisûn hin ka mâkpa ning i tih,” a ta."
22,"And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a siehlawhai chu thu a pêk a, “Inrûk takin David be unla, ‘Ngai ta, lal chu i chungah a lâwm hle el a, a siehlawhai po po khawma an hmangai che a nih; chuongchun, lal mâkpaa hin um el rawh,’ ti ro,” a ta."
23,"And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?","Chun, Saula siehlawhai chun chuong thuhai chu David na hrieta chun an hril a. David chun, “Mi pasie le tukhawm ingaisâng naw keia ta ding hin lal mâkpa hang ni chu thil namênah in ngai am a nih?” a ta."
24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.","Chun, Saula siehlawhai chun, “David chun chuong ang chun a ti a nih,” tiin an hril a."
25,"And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.","Chun, Saula chun, “David kuoma chun hieng ang hin ti ro khai, ‘Lal chun lal hmêlma phubalâkna dingin Philistin mihai servun za ti naw chu man ieng dang khawm a dit nawh,’ tiin,” a ta. Saula chun David chu Philistin mihai kuta inthitir a lungril tlat a."
26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. And the days were not expired;","Chun, a siehlawhaiin chuong thu chu David an hang hril chun, lal mâkpa a hang ni ding chu David chu a lâwm hle el a. Chun, ni tiemhai chu a la tling nawh a."
27,"and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.","David le a mihai chu an tho a, Philistin mi za hni an va that a: David chun an ser vun chu a hung phur a, chuongchun, lal mâkpa a ni theina dingin lal chu kimtakin an pêk a. Chuongchun, Saula chun a naunu Mikal chu nuhmeiah ân neitir tah a."
28,"And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.","Chun, Saula chun David kuoma chun Pathien a um a nih ti a hriet chieng tah a: chun, Saula naunu Mikal chun ama chu a hmangai a."
29,And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.,"Chuongchun, Saula chun David chu a ṭi zuol ta sau a, Saula chu David hmêlma a ni kumkhuo el tah a."
30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.","Chuongchun, Philistin mi lien- hai chu an vân thawk hlak a; chun, an hung inthawk dawk po leh David chu Saula siehlawhai po po nêka fel lemin a châng hlak a, chuongchun, a hming chu an chawisâng hle el tah a."
