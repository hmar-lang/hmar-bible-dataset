1,And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.,LALPA bâwm chu Philistin mihai rama chun thla sari a um a.
2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? show us wherewith we shall send it to its place.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun, “LALPA bâwm hi iengtin am thâwng ei ta? A umna pângngaia infetir nâwkna dân ding mi hril ta u khai,” tiin thiempuhai le aisânthiemhai an ko a."
3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.","Anni chun, “Israelhai Pathien bâwm hi infetir ding in ni khawma a ruok chun infetir dêr naw ro, a kuomah bâwsietna inthâwina inhlân ngei ro, chuongchun, sukdamin um in ta, chun, iengtiziea a kut chu a sawnpêk naw cheu am a na ti hrieng in tih,” an ta."
4,"Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.","Chun, anni chun, “A kuoma kan bawsietna inthâwina inhlân ding chu ieng am nîng a ta?” an ta. Anni chun, “Philistin lalhai zâtin rângkachak ngâwt lim panga le rângkachak chaichene lim panga, in rênga chunga hri inlêng le in lalhai chunga inlêng chu hmunkhat a ni sih a."
5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.","Chuleiin, in ngâwt limhai le in ram suksetu chaichene lim chu siem unla; chun, Israelhai Pathien chu chawimawi ro; chuongchun, a kut chu in chunga dâm, in pathien chunga dâm, in ram chunga dâm sukzâng nuom rawi naw nîm."
6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?","Aigupta mihai le Pharaoin lung- ril an sukngar ang khan iengdinga in lungril in sukngar am a na? Anni laia thil maktaka a thaw khan anni kha ân fetir a, an suok a nih naw am a nih?"
7,"Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;","Chuleiin, tuhin tawlailîr thar buotsai unla, bâwngpui pahni a nêne sâwr lai, rîngkawl lân bâttir ngailo chu bel unla; chun, an têhai chu in tieng hung ṭhuoipêk ro."
8,"and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.","Chun, LALPA bâwm chu la unla, tawlailîra chun sie unla, chun, baw- siet thilînhlâna in inhlân rângkachak thil hlu chu thingrema khumin a sîr- ah sie unla, infetir unla, inthla el ro."
9,"And see; if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.","Chuongchun, ama ramri tieng lampui hrawin Beth-semesa chun a fe am en ta u; a fe chun ei chunga thil ṭha nawtak hi ama thaw nîng a ta, a fe naw chun a mi hremtu chu ama kut a lo ni nawh ti hrieng ei ta, ei chunga hung um ve hrim hrim nîng a tih,” an tih a."
10,"And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;","Chun, mihai chun chuong ang chun an thawh a, bâwngpui a nêne sâwr lai pahni an ṭhuoi a, tawlailîra chun an bel a, an têhai chu in tieng an khum a;"
11,"and they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.","Chun, LALPA bâwm chu tawlai- lîra chun an sieh a, rângkachak chaichene lim le ngâwt lim siena thingrem leh."
12,"And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.","Chun, bâwngpuihai chun Beth- semes tieng panin lam chu an hraw ta ngat ngat a; chuongchun, inbu malam peiin lam tluongpui chu an hrawh a, changtieng amanih, vawitieng ama- nih khawm an pêt dêr nawh a; Philistin lalhai chun Beth-semes ramri chenin an zui a."
13,"And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.","Chun, Beth-semes khuoa mihai chun ruoma hin an bu an lo sîk a, an hang nghah a, bâwm chu an hang hmuh a, an lâwm ta êm êm a."
14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.","Tawlailîr chu Beth-semes khuoa mi Josua loa chun a hung lût a, lungpui lientak umna laia chun a ngîr ta zing a; chun, tawlailîr thing chu an chêk a, LALPA biekna dingin bâwngpuihai chu pumrawhmang thil inhlân dingin an hmang tah a."
15,"And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto Jehovah.","Chun, Levi chihai chun LALPA bâwm chu rângkachak thil hlu umna thingrem le chun an lâk thlâk a, lungpui chunga chun an sieh a; chun, Beth-semes khuoha mihai chun chu ni vêk chun pumrawhmang thil in- hlânhai le inthâwinahai chu LALPA kuomah an inhlân a."
16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.","Chu chu Philistin lal pangahai chun an hmu zo chun, chu ni le le chun Ekron khuo tieng an kîr nâwk tah a."
17,"And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering unto Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;","Philistin mihaiin rângkachak ngâwt lim LALPA kuoma bawsietna inthâwina dinga an inhlân chu hieng zât hi a nih; Asdod khaw puolin pakhat, Gaza khaw puolin pakhat, Askelon khaw puolin pakhat, Gath khaw puolin pakhat, Ekron khaw puolin pakhat;"
18,"and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of Jehovah, which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.","chun, rângkachak chaichene lim chu khuo po po kul nei khuo le thingtlâng tieng khuo khawm tiem vawng a, lal pangahai ta Philistin mihai khaw zât a nih. LALPA bâwm an innghatna lungpui ngei chu Beth-semes khuoa mi Josua loa chun tu chen hin a la um zing a nih."
19,"And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah, he smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter.","Chun, LALPA bâwm sûng an en leiin Beth-semes khuoa mihai chu a hrem a, anni laia mi sîng nga le sâwmsari zet a hrem a; LALPAIN a hrem nasat êm leiin mihai chu an ṭap a."
20,"And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?","Beth-semes khuoa mihai chun, “Hi Pathien inthieng LALPA hmaa hin tu am ngîr thei a ta, ei kuoma inthawk hi khâwlai am fe suok tâng a ta?” an ta."
21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.","Chuongchun, Kiriath-jearim khuoa mihai kuoma chun, “Philistin mihai chun LALPA bâwm chu an hung sie nâwk tah a, hung thla unla, in kuom tieng hung la ro khai,” tiha hril dingin mihai an tir a."
