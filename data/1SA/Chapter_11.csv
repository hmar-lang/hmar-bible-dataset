1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.","Chuongchun, Ammon mi Nahas chu a hung inthawk a, Jabes-Gilead thaw tumin a hang ep a; chun, Jabes mihai po po chun Nahas kuoma chun, “Kan kuomah thu thlung la, chuongchun, i rawng bâwl kan tih,” an ta."
2,"And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.","Ammon mi Nahas chun an kuomah, “Hieng ang hin a nih in kuoma thu ka thlung ding chu; in mit changtieng po po kheldawk vawng ding nîng a ta, chu chu Israel mi po pohai ta dinga hmingsietna nîng a tih,” a ta."
3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee.","Chun, Jabes khuoa upahai chun a kuomah, “Israel ram po poa mi kan hang tir theina dingin ni sari mi la ngai phawt rawh; chutaka a mi sandam ding tukhawm an um naw chun i kuomah hung suok el kan tih,” an ta."
4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.","Chuongchun, an mi tirhai chun Saula umna Gibea chu an hung tlung a, mipuihai na hrieta chun chuong thu chu an hril a, chun, mipuihai chun an râwl an insuoh a, an ṭap a."
5,"And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.","Chun, loa inthawkin Saula chu sebâwng hung khalin a hung a; Saula chun, “Ieng am an ti a na mipuihai chu an ṭap a?” a ta. Chun, Jabes khuoa mihai thuhril chu an hril a."
6,"And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hriet phingleh Saula chunga chun Pathien thlarau nasatakin a hung tlung tah a, nasatakin a lung chu a sen ta thut a."
7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.","Chuongchun, bâwng tuok khat a that a, a sa chu a chan nawi vawng a, Israel ram po poa chun ân semtir a; “Tukhawm Saula le Samuel hung zui nuom naw taphawt chu an sebâwng chu hieng anga thaw ve hi nîng a tih,” tiin. Chuongchun, mipuihai chun LALPA chu an ṭi tah a, an hung inthawk suok tah a."
8,"And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.","Bezek hmuna chun a tiem a; Israel mihai chu nuoi thum an nih, Juda mihai chu sing thum an na."
9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.","Chun, an mi hung tirhai kuoma chun, “Jabes-Gilead mihai kuoma chun, ‘Zîngah nisa lum vânglai tak hmain sansuok nîng in tih,’ va ti ro,” an ta. Chun, an mi tirhai chu an va feh a, Jabes mihai chu an va hril a: chuongchun, an lâwm ta êm êm a."
10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.","Chuongchun, Jabes mihai chun, “Zînga hin in kuomah hung suok kan ta, in nuom nuomin kan chunga hin thaw el ro,” an ta."
11,"And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.","Chun, a zînga chun Saula chun mipuihai chu pâwl thumin a siem a; zîng vêng hun lai takin an riekhmuna chun an lût a. Ammon mihai chu sûn nisa sat vânglai tak chenin an that a; an that mahlahai chu an indar vawng a, pahnia um hmunkhat hrim hrim khawm an um dêr nawh a."
12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.","Chun, mipuihai chun Samuel kuomah, “Tuhai am an na ‘Saula hin ei chungah ro a rêl el ding am a nih?’ tituhai kha? Chuong mihai chu hung ṭhuoi la lo sukhlum kan tih,” an ta."
13,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah hath wrought deliverance in Israel.","Saula chun, “Vawisûn kher hin chu tukhawm sukhlum ding a ni nawh ie, vawisûn hin LALPA chun Israelhai lai sandamna a hung siem ta sih a,” a ta."
14,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.","Chun, Samuel chun mipuihai kuoma chun, “Hung ro, Gilgala chun fêng ei tiu khai, chutaka chun ram hi indin thar nâwk ei tiu,” a ta."
15,And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Jehovah; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.,"Chuongchun, mipui po po chu Gilgala chun an fe tah a, Saula chu Gilgala chun LALPA hmaah lalah an siem tah a. Chutaka chun LALPA hmaa chun inremna thil- inhlânhai an inhlân a; chuong- chun, chutaka chun Saula le Israel mi po pohai chu an lâwm ta êm êm a."
