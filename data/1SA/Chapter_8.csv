1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.","Samuel chu a hung upa tah a, a naupasalhai chu Israel mihai chunga rorêltuhaiah a siem a."
2,"Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.","A nau lutir hming chu Joel a na, chun, a dawttu hming chu Abija a nih; anni chu Beer-sebaa rorêltu an na."
3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.","Nisienlakhawm, a nauhai chun a umdân chu an lâk ve nawh a, sum le pai tieng an hnawt a, thamnahai an lâk a, indik nawtakin ro an rêl a."
4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah;","Chuongchun, Israel mi upahai po po chu an inkhâwm a, Rama khuoa Samuel kuomah an feh a,"
5,"and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.","a kuomah, “Ngai ta, i hung upa ta hle el a, i naupasalhai hlak chun i umdân hi an lâk ve dêr si nawh a; hnam danghai po po ang bawka kan chunga ro mi rêlpêk dingin lal mi siempêk raw khai,” an ta."
6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.","Nisienlakhawm, a kuoma, “Ro mi rêlpêktu ding lal mi pe rawh,” an ti chun Samuel chu a suklâwm naw hleh a. Chuongchun, Samuel chu LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a."
7,"And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.","LALPA chun Samuel kuoma chun, “Mipuihaiin i kuoma an hril po po chu ngai rawh, nang dit naw che an ni nawh a; an chunga lal dinga kei mi dit lo an ni lem."
8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.","Aigupta rama inthawka ka ṭhuoi suok nia tuta chena an thil thaw dân po po, an mi nghatsan a, pathien danghai rawng dâm an mi bâwlsan hlak ang bawk hin i chungah an thaw a ni hi."
9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.","Chuleiin, an thu ngai rawh, amiruokchu, ursûntaka tiemkamin an chunga rorêltu lal châng dân ding chu khîkhmu chie rawh,” a ta."
10,And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king.,"Chun, Samuel chun LALPA thuhai po po chu lal hnitu mipuihai chu a hril vawng a."
11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;","“In chunga rorêltu lal châng dân ding chu hieng ang hi nîng a tih: in naupasalhai chu a sakawr le a tawlailîr chuongpuia hai ruot a ta, a tawlailîr hmaa tlânhai dâm um an ta;"
12,"and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.","chun, a sipai sâng hotua dâm, sâwmnga hotua dâm ruot a tih; ṭhenkhat chu a hnuoi inlettua dâm, a busîktua dâm, a indo thuomhnaw siemtua dâm, tawlailîr hmangruo siemtua dâm hmang a ta."
13,"And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.","In naunuhmeihai chu rimin- hnik siemtua dâm, bu suongtua dâm, bei siemtua dâm hmang a tih."
14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.","In lohai, in grêp huonhai, oliv huonhai, a ṭha ṭhahai chu lâkpêk a ti cheu a, a siehlawhai pêng a tih."
15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.","In thlai chi le in grêp huonhaia mi chu sâwma pakhat lâkpêk a ti cheu a, a siehlawhai le a hotuhai pêng a tih."
16,"And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.","In siehlawpahai, in siehlaw- nuhai, in tlangvâl ṭha ṭhahai le in sabengtunghai lâkpêk a ti cheu a, a sinthaw dingin ruoi a tih."
17,He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.,"In berâm ruol laia mi chu sâwma pakhat lâkpêk a ti cheu a; chun, ama siehlawhai nîng in tih."
18,And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.,"Chun, chu nia chun in la thlang ding in lal lei chun la khêk suok in ta, nisienlakhawm, chu nia chun LALPAIN dawn naw ni cheu,” a ta."
19,"But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us,","Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chun Samuel rawl chu an ngai nuom nawh a, “Ni lo e, lal kan nei ding a nih,"
20,"that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.","chuongchun, hnam dang po pohai ang hung nîng kan ta, chun, kan lal chun ro mi rêlpêk a ta, kan hmahai chu ṭhuoiin râlhai mi dopui a tih,” an ta."
21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chun mipui thuhrilhai po po chu a hriet a, LALPA naa chun a thun nâwk sâwng a."
22,"And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel kuomah, “An rawl chu ngai la, lal siempêk rawh,” a ta. Chun, Samuel chun Israel mihai kuomah, “Mi tin mâni khuo sengah fe ta ro,” a ta."
