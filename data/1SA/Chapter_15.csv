1,"And Samuel said unto Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “LALPAIN a mihai chungah, Israelhai chunga lal dinga hriek nâl ding chein a mi tir a nih; chuongchun, LALPA thuhril râwl chu ngai ta khai, Sipaihai LALPA chun."
2,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.",‘Amalek mihai Israelhai chunga an thilthaw Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok laia an lo dodâl dân dâm kha kân chik zing a.
3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.","Amalek mihai do dingin fe la, an thil nei po po hla hrim hrim nei dêr loin sukbohmang vawng rawh; nu- hmei le pasal, naute khawm, nêne ne laihai dâm, bâwngchal le berâm dâm, sanghâwngsei le sabengtung dâm leh sukhlum vawng rawh,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
4,"And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.","Chuongchun, Saula chun mi- puihai chu a ko khâwm a. Telaim khuoa chun a tiem a, sipai nuoi hni le Juda mi sîng khat an nih."
5,"And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.","Chun, Saula chun Amalek mihai khuo chu a zu tlung a, ruoma chun a lo lambun a."
6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.","Chun, Saula chun Ken mihai kuoma chun, “Hung suok unla, Amalek mihai laia inthawk hin insie fihlîm ro, chuong naw chun sukhlum sa rawi ka ti cheu, nangni chun chu Israel thlahai po po Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok khan in lo lunginsiet sih a,” a ta. Chuongchun, Ken mihai chu Amalek mihai laia inthawk chun an suok tah a."
7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt.","Chun, Saula chun Amalek mihai chu Havilaa inthawka Aigupta ram dep Sur chenin a thawh a."
8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.","Chun, Amalek mihai lal Agag chu a hringin a man a, mipuihai po po chu kâwlhnâmin a sât hlum vawng a."
9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.","Amiruokchu, Saula le mipuihai chun Agag chu an hlah a, berâm ṭha ṭhahai, bâwngchal ṭha ṭhahai, a thau thau dâm, berâmte le a ṭha po po leh, chuonghai chu an sukhlum nuom nawh a; a ṭha naw le an dit naw po chu an sukhlum vawng a."
10,"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Samuel kuoma chun a hung tlung a."
11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night.","“Saula hi lala ka ruot hi kân sîr ngawt el a nih; a mi zui lai chu a mi hnung innghatin ka thupêk angin a thaw si nawh a,” a ta. Chun, Samuel chu a lunginsen a, zânkhawvârin LALPA chu a ko a."
12,"And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.","Chun, Samuel chu Saula tuok dingin zîngkâr chun a tho a, chun, “Saula chu Karmelah a feh a, ngai ta, chutaka chun hriet zingna lung a phun a; chun, a kir nâwk a, a fe pei a, Gilgala chun a zu fe tah,” tiin Samuel chu an hril a."
13,"And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chu Saula kuom tieng chun a fe tah a; chun, Saula chun a kuomah, “LALPAIN malsâwm raw se che, LALPA thupêk ang chun ka thaw tah,” a ta."
14,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?","Chun, Samuel chun, “Chuong berâm inbe ka naa hung lût le, bâwngchal inbu ka hang hriet si chu iengtizie am a na?” a ta."
15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.","Chun, Saula chun, “Amalek mihai ta an hung lâkpêk a nih, LALPA i Pathien kuoma inthâwina dingin mipuihaiin berâm ṭha ṭhahai le, bâwngchal ṭha an hla a nih, chun a dang po po chu kan sukhlum vawng a nih,” a ta."
16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “Ngai rawh, zâni zâna LALPAIN thu ka kuoma a hril, hril ka ti che,” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “Hril raw khai,” a ta."
17,"And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel;","Chun, Samuel chun, “Nanga ngaia chun mi chîntak ni la khawm, Israelhai hotu dinga siem i ni a ni naw am a nih? Chun, LALPA chun Israelhai lal dingin hriek a nâl cheh a;"
18,"and Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.","chun, LALPA chun a tir suok cheh a. ‘Fe la, mi suolhai, Amalek mihai chu sukhlum vawng la, an bohmang dêr hmakhat chun thaw pei rawh,’ a ti cheh a."
19,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?","Iengdinga LALPA thu chu zâwm lo a, râllâk thil chu a bawa i bawh a, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw i thaw el am?” a ta."
20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.","Chun, Saula chun Samuel kuomah, “E, LALPA thu ka zâwm annâwm, LALPA mi tirna tienga chun ka feh a; Amalek lal Agag ka hung man a, Amalek mihai chu ka sukhlum vawng annâwm."
21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.","Amiruokchu, mipuihai chun râllâk thil berâm le bâwngchalhai sukbohmang ding laia a ṭha ṭhahai chu Gilgal khuoa LALPA i Pathien kuoma inthâwina dingin an hung lâk a nih,” a ta."
22,"And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.","Chun, Samuel chun, “LALPA chun LALPA thu zâwm chu a lâwm angin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai le inthâwinahai hi a lâwm am a nih? Ngai ta, inthâwina nêkin thuawi chu a ṭha lem a, berâmchal thau nêkin a thu pawm chu a ṭha lem a nih."
23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king.","Helna hi aisan thiemna suolhai leh ân ang a, kawmâwna hi milim biek le rîtlona suol tluk a nih. LALPA thu i dit naw leiin ama khawma lal dingin a dit bîk ta naw che a nih,” a ta."
24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.","Chun, Saula chun Samuel kuoma chun, “Thil ka suksuol dêr a ni chu, LALPA thupêk le i thu chu ka lo bawsiet a ni zing chu tie; mipuihai ka ṭia an râwl ka lo ngai leiin."
25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.","Chuongchun, ka suol chu ngaidam la, LALPA ka biek theina dingin mi fepui nâwk rawh,” a ta."
26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “Fepui naw tawp ka ti che, LALPA thu chu i dit si nawh a; chun, LALPA khawmin Israelhai lal dingin a dit bîk ta naw che a nih,” a ta."
27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent.","Chuongchun, Samuel chu fe dinga a hang inher chun a puon hmawr chu a chel a, a tlêr tah a."
28,"And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.","Chun, Samuel chun a kuomah, “Vawisûna inthawk hin LALPA chun Israel ram hi a lâkpêk ta cheh a, i nêka ṭha lem i tuolbâwm a pêk tah a nih."
29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.","Chun, Israelhai Thahrui chu inkhêl naw nih a, inkîr bawk naw nih; mihriem anga inkîr nâwk el mi a ni nawh a,” a ta."
30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.","Chuongchun, ama chun, “Ka lo suol a ni tah a, nisienlakhawm, ka mihai upa le, Israelhai hmaa hin mi chawimawi dingin ka ngên che a nih; chun, LALPA i Pathien ka biek theina dingin mi fepui hrâm bawk la,” a ta."
31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, Samuel chun Saula chu a fepui tah a; Saula chun LALPA chu a biek tah a."
32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.","Chun, Samuel chun, “Amalek mihai lal Agag chu ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro,” a tih a. Chuongchun, Agag chu a kuoma chun inthin pumin a va feh a. Chun, Agag chun, “Thina kha chu ka pumpel ta chu ni âwmtak a na,” a ta."
33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.","Chun, Samuel chun, “I kâwl- hnâmin nuhmeihai nau boa a siem angin i nu khawm nuhmei laia nau bo mi nîng a tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Samuel chun Agag chu Gilgal khuoa chun LALPA hmaah a sât nawi neng el tah a."
34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.,"Chun, Samuel chu Rama khuo- ah a feh a; chun, Saula chu a umna khuo Gibeaa chun a hang fe tah a."
35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.,"Chuongchun, Samuel chun a thi ni chenin Saula chu a sir nâwk ta nawh a; amiruokchu, Samuel chu Saula leiin a lungngai a nih; chun, LALPA khawm chu Israelhai lal dinga Saula a lo siem chu ân sîr a nih."
