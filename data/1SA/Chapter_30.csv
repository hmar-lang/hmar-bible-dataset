1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,","Chun, a ni thum nia David le a mihaiin Ziklag an tlung chun Amalek mihaiin Simtieng le Ziklag khuo chu an lo rûn zing tah a. Ziklag khuo chu an lo sawisah a, an lo rawh a;"
2,"and had taken captive the women and all that were therein, both small and great: they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way.","nuhmeihai le chu khuoa um taphawthai chu a lien a chînin salah an man a, tukhawm that loin an ṭhuoi a, an fepui tah a."
3,"And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.","Chun, David le a mihaiin khuo an va tlung chun, ngai ta, a lo kâng fai vawng tah a; chun, an nuhmeihai, an naupasalhai, an naunuhmeihai chu salah an lo man tah a."
4,"Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.","Chuongchun, David le a kuoma umhai chun an râwl an insuoh a, ṭap hlei thei lo lêkin an ṭap a."
5,"And David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.","Chun, David nuhmeihai pahni Jezreel mi Ahinoam le Karmela mi Nabal nuhmei Abigail hai khawm chu salah an ṭhuoi tah a."
6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.","Chun, David chu a lunginzîng hle el a, mi tin an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai leiin mi po po an lungril a na êm êm a, ama chu lunga dêng thu an hril leiin; nisienla- khawm, David chu a Pathien LALPAA chun ân sukhrât a."
7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.","Chun, David chun Ahimelek naupa thiempu Abiathar kuoma chun, “Thiempu zakawsîng mi va lapêk raw khai,” a ta. Abiathar chun David chu thiempu zakawsîng a va lâkpêk a."
8,"And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake them, and shalt without fail recover all.","Chun, David chun, “Chuonghai chu hnawt lang, la hnawt phâk ka ti?” tiin LALPA ân dawn a. Ama chun a hung dawn a, “Hnawt rawh, hnawt phâk ngei ngei i ta, sansuok vawng ngei ngei i tih,” a ta."
9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.","Chuongchun, David chu a fe tah a, ama le a kuoma mi za rukhai le chun; chun, Besor vadung chu an va tlung a, chutaka chun an mi mâksanhai chu an um a."
10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.","David ruok chun a hnawt pei a, ama le mi za lihai le chun, mi za hni chu an chau ta leiin Besor vadung chu an kai thei ta nawh a, an lo um tah a nih."
11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink;","Chun, phûla hin Aigupta mi an va hmuh a, David kuoma chun an ṭhuoi a, bei an pêk a, a lo fâk a; chun, tui dâwn ding an pêk a;"
12,"and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.","chun, theichang hlawm tlang khat le grêp ra emṭâwl bâwr hni an pêk a; chun, chuong chu a hang fâk chun a hung har nâwk tah a; ni thum le zân thum bu fa lo le tui dâwn lo a ni sih a."
13,"And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.","Chun, David chun a kuomah, “Tu mi am i na? Khâwlaia inthawka hung am i nih a?” a ta. Ama chun, “Aigupta ram tlangvâl, Amalek mi siehlaw ka na; chun, ni thum a ni tah a, ka dam naw leiin ka pu chun a mi mâksan el a nih."
14,"We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.","Kereth Sim ram le Juda chan Sim ramhai kan rûn a, chun, Kaleb Sim ram kan rûn bawk a; chun, Ziklag khuo khawm kan rawh a,” a ta."
15,"And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.","David chun a kuomah, “Chuonghai rawi umnaa chun mi zu ṭhuoi thei i ti?” a ta. Ama chun, “Mi that lo ding le, ka pu kuta mi pe nâwk lo dingin Pathien hming sâlin ṭawng inkhâm la, chuongchun, chuonghai umnaa chun zu ṭhuoi ka ti che,” a ta."
16,"And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.","Chun, a zuk ṭhuoi thlâk chun, ngai ta, Philistin ram le Judai rama râllâk tamtak an lâk leiin ruoi an ṭheh a, an fâkin an dâwn a, an lo um dar nei nuoi a."
17,"And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.","Chuongchun, David chun nisa tlâka inthawkin a zînga zântieng chenin a thaw tah a, tlangvâl za li, sanghâwngsei chunga chuonga tlân- sehai ti chau naw chu tukhawm dama suok hrim hrim an um nawh a."
18,And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.,"Chun, David chun Amalek mihaiin an lâk po po chu a lâk nâwk vawng a; chun, David chun a nuhmei pahnihai chu a sansuok bawk a."
19,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.","Chuongchun, a lien a chînin an naupasalhai, an naunuhmeihai, an râllâk le an thil lâk hrim hrim iengkhawm chân an nei nawh a, David chun a lâkpêk nâwk vawng a nih."
20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil.","Chun, David chun berâm ruol le ran ruolhai po po chu a lâk a, ran danghai hmaa chun an khal a, “Hieng hi David râllâk a ni hi,” an ta."
21,"And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.","Chun, mi za hni an châu leia David zui thei loa Besor vadunga an inumtirhai kuom chu David chun a va tlung a; chun, anni chu David tuok ding le a kuoma um vehai chu tuok dingin an fe suok a; chun, David chun mipuihai kuom a va tlung chun chibai a bûk tâwl a."
22,"Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.","Chuongchun, David kuoma fe vehai laia mi suolhai le Belial mihai po po chun an dawn a, “Ei kuoma an fe ve naw leiin râllâk thil ei va lâk- pêk nâwk hrim hrim chu pe ve nâwng ei ta, an ṭhuoi a, an fe theina dingin an nuhmeihai le an nauhai seng ruok chu an ṭhuoi phal ei tih,” an ta."
23,"Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.","Chuongchun, David chun, “Unauhai, LALPA chun a mi humpêk a, mi do dinga hung inthawkhai ei kuta petu thil mi pêkhai chu chuong ang chun thaw naw ti niu."
24,"And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as his share is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his share be that tarrieth by the baggage: they shall share alike.","Tuin am hi thua hin in thu hi pawm a ta? Indonaa zu fehai chan ang bawk chu thuomhnaw vênga lo umhai chun an chang ve ding an- nâwm; inang vawnga chang ding a nih,” a ta."
25,"And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.","Chuongchun, chu nia inthawk tu chen hin Israelhai ta dinga thupêk le dâna nei dingin a siem tah a."
26,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:","Chun, Davidin Ziklag khuo a tlung chun, râllâk ṭhenkhat chu, “Hi hi LALPA hmêlmahaia inthawka râllâk, lâwmman dingin kân phur cheu,” tiin,"
27,"to them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir,","Bethela um dâm, Sim Ramotha um dâm, Jattira um dâm:"
28,"and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa,","Aroera um dâm, Sipmoth-a um dâm, Estemoa um dâm:"
29,"and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites,","Rakala um dâm, Jerahmeel khuohaia umhai dâm, Ken khuohaia umhai dâm:"
30,"and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach,","Hormaa umhai dâm, Borasana umhai dâm, Athaka umhai dâm,"
31,"and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.","Hebrona umhai dâm, David le a mihai chêttlatna hmun po poa um Juda upa, a ruolhai kuoma chun a thawn a."
