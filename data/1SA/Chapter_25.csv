1,"And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.","Chun, Samuel chu a thi tah a; chun, Israel mihai po po chu an inko khâwm a, an ṭah a; Rama khuoa a ina chun an phûm tah a. Chun, David chu a tho a, Paran thlalêrah a zu feh a."
2,"And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.","Chun, Maon khuoa chun mi pakhat a um a, a khawsakna chu Karmel tlângah a nih, mi ropuitak a na, berâm sâng thum le kêl sâng khat a nei a, Karmel tlânga chun a berâm hmul a vawh a."
3,"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.","Chu mipa hming chu Nabal a nih; a nuhmei hming chu Abigail a nih, chu nuhmei chu bengvârtak, hmêl- ṭhatak a na; a pasal ruok chu mi biek intaktak le mi rilotak a nih; Kaleb thla a nih."
4,And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.,"Chun, David chun thlalêra in- thawk chun Nabal chun a berâm hmul a vaw ti a lo hriet a."
5,"And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:","Chuongchun, Davidin tlangvâl sâwm a tir a, tlangvâlhai kuoma chun, Davidin, “Karmel tlânga chun hang fe unla, Nabal kuoma chun hang fe unla, keia hmingin chibai hang bûk ro;"
6,"and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.","chun, mi neinungtakpa kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril ro, ‘I chunga dâm, i sûngkuohai chunga dâm, i nei po po chunga dâm, lungmuongna um raw se."
7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.","I berâm hmul vâwtuhai an um ti ka hriet a; I berâm vêngtuhai chu ka kuoma hin an um hlak a, an pawi iengkhawm kan tâwk nawh a, Karmel tlânga an um sûng hrim hrim hin iengkhawm an chân nawh."
8,"Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.","I tlangvâlhai indawn la hril el an ti che; chuleiin, tlangvâlhai hi lo lunginsiet rawh, a remchâng ni takin kan hung tlung a ni hi; i nei ang ang chu i siehlawhai le i naupa David hi lo pe ta, a tih a,’ va ti ro,” a ta."
9,"And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.","Chun, David tlangvâlhai chu an va tlung chun, David hming chun chuong thu po po chu Nabal kuoma chun an hril a, chun, to zingin an nghâk a."
10,"And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master.","Chun, Nabal chun David sie- hlawhai chu a dawn a, “David chu tu am a ni leh? Jesai naupa chu tu am a ni leh? Tulai hin siehlaw tamtak puhai tlân hmangsan an tam el a."
11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?","Ka bei dâm, ka tui dâm, le ka berâm hmul vâwtuhai ta dinga ka that sa hi tuhai am an ni khawm hriet hlei lo mihai chu ka pêk hlak ding am a nih?” a ta."
12,"So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.","Chuongchun, David tlangvâl- hai chu an lêt nâwk a, an kîr nâwk a; chuong thu po po chu an hung hril a."
13,"And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.","Chun, David chun a mihai kuoma chun, “In kâwlhnâm pai seng ro,” a ta. Chun, an kâwlhnâm chu an pai seng a, David khawm chun a kâwlhnâm chu a pai a; mi za li laiin David chu an hang zui a; chun, mi za hni chu thuomhnaw nghâkin an um a."
14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.","Chun, tlangvâl pakhat chun Na- bal nuhmei Abigail kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, David chun thlalêra inthawkin kan pu hi chibai bûk dingin mihai a hungtir a, ama chun a lo hal a."
15,"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:","Nisienlakhawm, anni chu kan chungah an ṭha hle el a, kan pawi iengkhawm an tâwk nawh a, phûla kan uma kan um hmunkhat sûng po po khan iengkhawm kan inhmang nawh a;"
16,"they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.",berâm vênga an kuoma kan um sûng po po chun sûn le zân kan ta dinga kul an ni ringawt el a.
17,"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one cannot speak to him.","Chuleiin, ieng am a na i thaw ding, nguntakin ngaituo ta khai, kan pu sûngkuo le ama chunga hin thil ṭha naw thaw tumna a um a nih; ama hlak hi Belial naupa a ni ringawt el a, tu ibiek thei khawm a ni si nawh a,” a ta."
18,"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.","Chun, Abigail chun inhmâwtak- in, bei tlang za hni le uoin peng hni leh, berâm panga suong el dinga inzo sa hieu leh, beiphit bûk nga leh, grêp ra em ṭâwl bâwr za leh, theichang hlawm za hni leh a lâkkhâwm a, sabengtung ân phurtir a."
19,"And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.","Chun, a siehlaw tlangvâlhai kuoma chun, “Ka hmaah lo fe pei unla, ngai ta u, hung zui ka ti cheu,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, a pasal Nabal chu a hril nawh a."
20,"And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.","Chuongchun, a sabengtung chunga chun a chuong a, tlâng kâr- kawta a ṭum laiin ngai ta, David le a mihai chun an hung pan a; chuong- chun, an intuok tah a."
21,"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good.","David chun, “A iengkhawm, ân hmang nawna dingin hi mipa nei hi thlalêrah a thlâwn ela vêngpêk ka lo ni hi tie; thil ṭha chu thil ṭha nawin a mi thung el ta sih a."
22,"God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.","Zingah zîng khawvar chena a ta po po laia pasal naupang pakhat chau hringna khawm ka hla a ni chun Pathienin David chu a thaw thawin thaw raw se, chu nêka nasa khawmin,” a ti ta sih a."
23,"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.","Chun, Abigail chun David a hmu chun a sabengtunga inthawk chun a ṭum vat a, David hmaa chun a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a."
24,"And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.","Chun, a ke bula chun a bawk- khup a, “Keimân, pu, keima ngeiin khawhlona chu phur el ka tih, chun, i siehlawnu hin i na hrietah thu hril sienla, i siehlawnu thuhril chu ngai dingin ka hni che a nih."
25,"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.","Ka hni che, ka lalpa hin Belial mi Nabal chu ienga khawm ngai naw raw khai, a hming ang chie el hi a ni hrim a nih, Nabal an ti namân, ân vêt a ni hi, kei i siehlawnu hin ka pu tlangvâl hungtirhai kha chu ka lo hmu naw a nih."
26,"Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.","Chuleiin, tuhin pu Lalpa hring- na le i hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ka lo hmu naw takzet a nih, LALPAIN thisen insuo lo ding le i kuta phuba la lo dingin a siem si cheh a, i hmêl- mahai le ka pu ṭhat nawna zawng- tuhai chu Nabal ang ni el raw se."
27,"And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.","Chun, hi ka pu ta dinga i siehlawin lâwmman ka hung chawi hi ka pu hung zuitu tlangvâlhai hi pêk ni raw se."
28,"Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of Jehovah; and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days.","Ka hni che a nih, i siehlawnu suolna hi ngaidam rawh, LALPA chun ka pu hi sûngkuo nghettakah indin ngei ngei a ta, ka pu hi LALPA indonahai do a ni sih a; i dam sûng po po chun nangmaa chun suolna hrim hrim hmu ding um naw nih."
29,"And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.","Nangma hnawt ding che le i hringna sukbo dingin mihai hung in- thawk hai sien khawm, ka pu hringna chu LALPA i Pathien le hringna intêl laia intêl nîng a ta; i hmêlmahai hringna ruok chu vailungdêng phana dêng angin dêng hmang dai a tih."
30,"And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,","Chun, LALPAIN i chungchâng thua thil ṭha tiem ang po ka pu chunga hin a thaw phaa Israelhai lala a siem pha che chun,"
31,"that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.","a san um loa thisen insuo loa, ka pu chun phuba i lâk bawk naw hi i ta ding chun lungngaina hrim hrim ni naw nih a, ka pu ta dingin lung ninawna hrim hrim ni naw nih a; chun, LALPAIN ka lalpa chunga hin thil ṭha a thaw pha chun i siehlawnu hi hre zing rawh aw,” a ta."
32,"And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:","Chun, David chun Abigail kuoma chun, “Vawisûna mi tuok dinga hung tirtu che LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se;"
33,"and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.","chun, i remhrietna chu mal- sâwmin um sienla, chun, nang thisen insuo thiemnawnaa inthawka mi humtu le keima kuta phuba la loa mi siemtu chu malsâwmin um bawk rawh."
34,"For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.","Nangin mi lo tuok vak naw la chu, LALPA Israelhai Pathien hring- na sâlin ka hril a, zînga khawvar chen chun Nabal chu naupang pa- khat chau khawm hlapêk naw tawp ka tih,” a ta."
35,"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.","Chuongchun, David chun a thil hung chawipêkhai chu a lâk a; chun, a kuoma chun, “Lungmuongtakin, in tieng hang fe ta la, chun, i thu chu ka awi a, i hni chu ka pawmpêk che a nih aw,” a ta."
36,"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.","Chun, Abigail chu Nabal kuoma chun a hang feh a; chun, ngai ta, a ina chun lal ruoiṭhe ang elin ruoi a lo ṭheh a, ân rui hle leiin Nabal chu a hlim huom el a; chuleiin, a zîng khawvar hmakhat chun iengkhawm, a hril nawh a."
37,"And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.","Chun, zîngtienga Nabal uoin inrui chu a hung har chun a nuhmei chun chuong thu chu a hang hril a, a lungril chu a mit ta sul a, lung ang elin a hung um tah a."
38,"And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died.","Chun, ni sâwm hnunga chun LALPAIN Nabal chunga chun kut a thlâk a, a thi tah a."
39,"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And David sent and spake concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife.","Chun, Davidin Nabal chu a thi ti a hang hriet chun, “Ka hming sietna dingin Nabal thilthawa mi hrilpuia, a siehlaw chu thil ṭha naw chu thaw lo dinga mi khaptu LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se; Nabal thil ṭha naw thaw chu LALPAIN ama chung ngeiah ân tlâktir tah a nih,” a ta. Chun, David chun Abigail chu nu- hmei dinga va be dingin mi a tir a."
40,"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.","Chun, David siehlawhai chun Karmel tlânga Abigail kuom an va tlung chun, “David chun a nuhmei dinga ṭhuoi ding chein a mi tir a nih,” tiin an biek a."
41,"And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.","Chun, a tho a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a; “Ngai ta u, in siehlawnu hi ka lalpa siehlawhai ke sâwp dinga siehlaw ka nih,” a ta."
42,"And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.","Chuongchun, Abigail chu a tho vak a, sabengtung chungah a chuong a, a hnungzui nunghâk pangahai le chun David mi tirhai chu an zui tah a, a nuhmeiah a um tah a."
43,David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.,"David chun Jezreela mi Ahinoam a lo nei ta bawk a; chuong- chun, a nuhmeia chun an um ve ve tah a."
44,"Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.",Saula chun a naunu Mikal David nuhmei kha Gallim khuoa Lais naupa Palti a lo inneitir tah a nih.
