1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.","Chun, Samuel chun Israel mi po pohai kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, ka kuoma in thuhrilhai po poa chun in râwl ka ngai a, lal ding chu ka siempêk ta cheu a."
2,"And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day.","Tuhin, ngai ta u, lal chun a lo keihruoi ta cheu a, kei chu ka hung tarin ka lu khawm ân ṭuok tah a; chun, ngai ta u, ka naupasalhai chu nangni lai an um a, ka tleirâwla inthawkin tu chen hin ka keihruoi cheu a."
3,"Here I am: witness against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.","Hitaka hin ka um a, LALPA hmaa le a hrieknâl hmaa hin mi sêl ro le? Tu bâwngchal am ka lâkpêk hlak a? Tu sabengtung am ka lâkpêk hlak a? Tu am ka hlêm ta hlak a? Tu am ka suknawmna hlak a? Ka mit sukdel dingin tu kuoma inthawkin am thamna ka lâk hlak a? Thung nâwk vawng ka ti cheu,” a ta."
4,"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man’s hand.","Anni chun, “I mi hlêm ngai nawh a, i mi suknawmna ngai bawk nawh a, tu kuta inthawk khawma lâk âwm lo chu i lâk ngai bawk nawh,” an ta."
5,"And he said unto them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Ka kuta hin âwm naw ieng khawm in hmu nawh ti vawisûn hin LALPA chu nangni laia hretu a nih; a hriek nâl khawm chu hretu a nih,” a ta. Chun, anni chun, “Ama chu hretu a nih,” an ta."
6,"And Samuel said unto the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.","Chun, Samuel chun mipui kuoma chun, “Mosie le Aron ruottu le Aigupta rama inthawka in puhai ṭhuoi suoktu LALPA chu a nih in sawnnaw."
7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers.","Chuongchun, ngîr ṭhap unla, LALPA hmaa hin LALPAIN in chunga le in puhai chunga thil a lo thaw fel dân hang sûtpui ka ti cheu."
8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.","Aigupta rama Jakob a lût hnung khan, in puhai chun LALPA an ko a, chuongchun, LALPA chun Mosie le Aron a tir a, anni chun in puhai chu Aigupta rama inthawkin an ṭhuoi suok a, hi hmuna hin an inumtir tah a."
9,"But they forgat Jehovah their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA an Pathien chu an theinghil a; chun, ama chun Hazor sipai hotu Sisera kuta le Philistin mihai kuta le, Moab lal kutah a zawr a, chun, anni chun an do a."
10,"And they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.","Chun, LALPA chu an ko a, ‘LALPA chu kan nghatsan a, Baalhai, Astarothhai rawng kan bâwl leiin kan lo suol tah a nih; nisienlakhawm, kan hmêlmahai kuta inthawk hin mi sansuok ta la; chuongchun, i rawng- bâwl kan tih,’ an ta."
11,"And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and ye dwelt in safety.","Chun, LALPA chun, Jerubbaal hai, Bedan hai, Jephtha hai, Samuel hai a tir a, in hmêlma khingtieng khingtienga mihai kuta inthawkin a sansuok cheu a, himtakin in um a."
12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.","Chun, Ammon thlahai lal Nahas chu nangni do dingin a hung ti in hriet phingleh ka kuomah, ‘A ni nawh ie, lalin ro mi rêlpêk raw se,’ in tih a, LALPA Pathien chu in lal a ni zing sih a."
13,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you.","Chuleiin, in lal thlang le hni chu en ta u, LALPA chun lal a siempêk ta cheu a ni hi."
14,"If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, well:","LALPA chu in ṭih a, a rawng in bâwl a, a râwl in ngai a, LALPA thupêk in helsan nawh a, nangni le in chunga rorêltuhai leh LALPA in Pathien zuituhai in ni chun ṭhang a ta;"
15,"but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as it was against your fathers.","amiruokchu, LALPA râwl chu ngai loa LALPA thupêk in helsan chun in puhaiin LALPA kut an tuor ang bawkin nangni khawma tuor in tih."
16,"Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes.","Chuongchun, ngir ṭhap unla, LALPAIN in mithmua thil ropuitak a thaw ding hi lo en ro."
17,"Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king.","Vawisûn hin bu an sîk a ni naw am a nih? Vân inrûmtir ding le ruo insûrtir dingin LALPA chu ko ka ta; chuongchun, lal in hni thua hin LAL- PA mithmua thil in thaw suol hi a nasatzie hi hrein hmûng in tih,” a ta."
18,So Samuel called unto Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.,"Chuongchun, Samuel chun LALPA chu a ko a, LALPA chun chu ni chun vân ân rûmtir a, ruo ân sûrtir tah a; chuongchun, mipui chun LALPA le Samuel chu an ṭi ta êm êm el a."
19,"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto Jehovah thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.","Chun, mipui po po chun Samuel kuoma chun, “Kan thi nawna dingin LALPA i Pathien kuoma chun i siehlawhai hi mi ṭawngṭaipêk rawh, hi thil ṭha nawtak, lal kan lo hni hi, kan suol po po belsatu a ni ta hi,” an ta."
20,"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart:","Chun, Samuel chun, mipuihai kuoma chun, “Ṭi naw ro, hi thil ṭha nawtak hi thaw chu in thaw ngei a, amiruokchu, LALPA in zui chun ama chu pêtsan chuong naw unla, in lungril po poin LALPA rawng chu bâwl lem ro;"
21,"and turn ye not aside; for then would ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.","iengkhawma ṭhahnem lo ding le sansuok thei lo ding cheu zuiin pêtsan naw ro, teplo mei mei an ni sih a."
22,"For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself.","A hming ropuitak lei hin LALPA chun a mihai chu a nghatsan âwm si nawh a, a mihai ni dinga siem cheu chu LALPA lâwm zâwngtak a ni sih a."
23,"Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.","Chu chau khawm chu a ni nawh a, in ta dinga ṭawngṭai mah a, LALPA chunga suol chu keia ta ding khawma a âwm naw tawp a nih; lampui ṭha le lampui indik khîkhmu pei lem ka ti cheu."
24,"Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you.","LALPA chu ṭi phawt el unla, in lungril po poin titakzetin a rawng bâwl unla, in ta dinga thil a thaw ropuizie hi ngaituo ro khai."
25,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.","Amiruokchu, suoltaka thil in la thaw rawp chun bohmang in tih, nangni le in lal khawm,” a ta."
