1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.","Chun, chuong lai chun Philistin mihai chun an sipaihai chu Israel mihai thawa do dingin an ko khâwm rak el a. Chun, Akis chun David kuomah, “Nang le i mihai chu sipaihai lai, ka kuomah in fe ve ngei ding a nih ti hre rawh,” a ta."
2,"And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.","Chun, David chun Akis kuomah, “Aw le, i siehlaw thilthawthei dân chu hre el i tih,” a ta. Chun, Akis chun David kuomah, “A ṭha chu! a mi vêngtuah siem kumkhuong ka ti che,” a ta."
3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.","Samuel chu a thi tah a, Israel mihai po poin an ṭah a, ama khuo ngei Rama khuoa chun an phûm tah a. Chun, Saula chun an khawhri aisânthiem zâwlnei le dawithiemhai chu a rama inthawk chun a hnawt suok vawng tah a."
4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu an pungkhâwm a, Sunema chun ṭhang- hmun an va khuor a; chun, Saula chun Israel mi po po a ko khâwm a, Gilboaah ṭhanghmun an khuor veh a."
5,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.","Chun, Saula chun Philistin mi sipaihai a hmu chun a ṭih a, a lungril ân thin hlawp hlawp el a."
6,"And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.","Chun, Saula chun LALPA a hang rawn khawmin LALPA chun mangin amanih, Urimin amanih, zâwlneiin amani khawm a dawn hrim hrim nawh a."
7,"Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a sie- hlawhai kuoma chun, “Khawhri aisânthiem zâwl nuhmei a kuoma ka fea ka râwn dingin mi zawngpêk ro,” a ta. Chun, a siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Endor khuoah khawhri aisânthiem zâwl nuhmei a um annaw,” an ta."
8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.","Chun, Saula chu ân sukdanglam a, a puon danglam a sil a, ama le mi dang pahni leh an feh a, zânah nuhmei kuoma chun an va tlung a; chun, khawhri aisânnu kuoma chun, “Ai mi sânpêk la, i kuoma hming ka lam taphawthai chu mi ko suokpêk rawh,” a ta."
9,"And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?","Nuhmei chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Saula thilthaw chu i hriet a, a rama khawhri aisânthiem le dawi- thiemhai chu a sukbo zo tah a, iengdingin am ka thina dingin ka hringna châng i kam ding a ni leh?” a ta."
10,"And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.","Chun, Saula chun LALPA hming sâlin, “LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril hi, hi thil lei hin i chungah hremna tlung naw nih,” tiin a kuoma chun ṭawng ân khâm a."
11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chun, “Tu am hang ko suokpêk ka ti cheh a?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Samuel mi hung ko suokpêk rawh,” a ta."
12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.","Chun, nuhmei chun Samuel a hang hmu chun râwl inringtakin a khêk a; chun, nuhmei chun Saula kuomah, “Iengdinga i mi hlêm am a na, Saula i ni zing sih a?” a ta."
13,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh, ieng am a ni ta leh i hmu?” a ta. Chun, nuhmei chun Saula kuomah, “Hnuoia inthawka pathien hung suok ka hmu,” a ta."
14,"And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.","Chun, a kuomah, “Ieng ang am a na?” a ta. Ama chun, “Tarsie hi a hung suok a, zakawfuol a hâk,” a ta. Chun, Saula chun Samuel a nih ti a hriet a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a."
15,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.","Chun, Samuel chun Saula kuomah, “Iengdinga hienga i mi ko suok buoi am a na?” a ta. Saula chun a dawn a, “Ka lunginzîng êm êm ela a nih, Philistin mihai chun an mi do a, Pathien hlak chun a mi nghatsan a, zâwlneiin amanih, mangin amani khawm a mi dawn ta hrim hrim nawh a; chuleiin, ka thaw ding mi hril dingin ka ko el che a nih,” a ta."
16,"And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?","Chun, Samuel chun, “Chuonga LALPA chun a nghatsan ta cheh a, i hmêlma a hung ni tah ti hre zing sa chun iengdinga thu i mîn dawn am a na?"
17,"And Jehovah hath done unto thee, as he spake by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.","Keima hmanga a hril ang khan LALPA chun i chungah a thaw tah a ni chu; LALPA chun i kuta inthawkin ram chu a lâkpêk a, i tuolbâwm David ngei chu a pêk tah a nih."
18,"Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day.","LALPA thu i awi naw lei le, Amalek mihai chunga a lunginsenna nasatak ang khan, i hlen naw leiin tuhin i chungah hi thil hi a thaw tah a ni hi."
19,Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: Jehovah will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.,"Chu naw khawm chu LALPA chun nang le Israel mihai khawm chu Philistin mihai kutah pêng a ta; chun, zînga hin nang le i naupasalhai chu ka kuomah hung um in tih; LALPA chun Israel sipaihai khawm chu Phi- listin mihai kutah pêng a tih,” a ta."
20,"Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.","Chuongchun, Samuel thuhril lei chun Saula chu a ṭi ta êm êm el a, hnuoiah a tlu dêr el tah a, tha le zung hrim hrim a nei ta nawh a, sûn- nithlâk le zânkhawvâra bu fa lo a ni sih a."
21,"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.","Chun, nuhmei chu Saula kuoma chun a feh a, a lungngai êm êm ti a hriet a, a kuomah, “Ngai ta, i siehlawnu hin i hril chu ka awi a, thi le thi tiin ka kuoma i thuhrilhai chu ka pawm a nih."
22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.","Chuleiin, nang khawmin i siehlawnu thu chu awi ve rawh, bu tlâwmte bêk hung pêng ka ti che a, chuongchun, i fe phaa thahrui i nei theina dingin fa rawh,” a ta."
23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.","Nisienlakhawm, a nuom nawh a, “Fa naw ningah,” a ta. Nisienla- khawm, a siehlawhai chun nuhmei le chun an tir ṭâl a, an thu chu a awi tah a. Chuongchun, hnuoia inthawk chu a tho a, khuma chun a ṭhung a."
24,"And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:","Chun, nuhmei chun sebâwngte châwm thau a ina chun a nei a, a va that vak a, chun, beiphit a lâk a, a hmet a, chawl ṭhanglo bei a siem a."
25,"and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.","Saula le a siehlawhai hmaa chun a va sieh a, chun, an lo fâk tah a. Chuongchun, an tho a, chu zân chun an fe tah a."
