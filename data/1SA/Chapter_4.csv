1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.","Chun, Samuel thu chu Israel mi po po lai chun ân thang suok tah a."
2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu Israel mihai lo dang dingin an lo inzar dar a; chun, an hang inthaw chun Philistin mihai hmaa chun Israel mihai chu an tlâwm tah a; indona hmuna chun sipai sâng li lai amanih an that a."
3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.","Chun, mipuihai chu an riek- hmuna an fe chun Israel upahai chun, “Ieng leia vawisûn hin Philistin mihai hmaa LALPAIN a mi suk- tlâwm am a nih aw? Ei kuoma um a, ei hmêlmahai kuta inthawka mi sandam dingin Siloa inthawkin LALPA thuthlungna bâwm kha hang lâng ei tiu,” an ta."
4,"So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.","Chuongchun, mipuihai chun Siloa chun mi an tir a, chutaka in- thawk chun cherubim chunga ṭhung, sipaihai LALPA thuthlung bâwm chu an va lâk tah a; Pathien thuthlung bâwm an lâknaa chun Eli naupasal- hai pahni Hophni le Phinehas an ṭhang veh a."
5,"And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.","Chuongchun, LALPA thuthlung bâwmin an riekhmun a hung tlung chun, Israel mi po pohai chu inring- takin an khêk ta dur dur el a, hnuoi chen khawm a tlawr ri dur dur el a."
6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp.","Chun, Philistin mihaiin an khêkri an hriet chun, “Hebraihai riekhmuna khêkri inri ta dur dur el chu iengtizie am a ni ta leh?” an ta. Chun, an riekhmuna chun LALPA bâwm a hung tlung a nih ti an hriet tah a."
7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun an ṭi tah a, “Riekhmuna chun Pathien a hung a ni ta chu teh,” an tih a. “Ei chung a rik ie, kha hma khan chuong ang chu a um ngai si nawh a."
8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.,"Ei chung a rik ie! chuong pathienhai kut hrâttaka inthawk chun tuin am mi sandam a ta? Chuong pathienhai chu an nih, Aigupta mihai thlalêra hri tinrênga sukhlumtu chu."
9,"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.","Aw, nangni Philistin mihai, in siehlawa an um ang khan Hebraihai siehlawah in um nawna dingin hrâttakin um unla, insukpasal ro khai, insukpasal unla thaw pei ro,” an ta."
10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.","Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun an hang thawh a, Israel mihai chu an tlâwm a, an puonin tieng seng an tlân ta vawng a; an that nasa êm êm el a, Israelhai laia sipai sîng thum an thi a nih."
11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.","Chun, Pathien bâwm chu an lâkpêk a; Eli naupahai pahni, Hophni le Phinehas chu an that bawk a."
12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.","Sipai laia Benjamin thla, mi pakhat a tlân a, a puonhai tlêr nung le a lua pilvut kai rakin chu ni ngei chun, Silo chu a va tlung a."
13,"And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.","Chun, a va tlung chun, Eli chun lampui sîra a ṭhungnaa ṭhung pumin a lo thlîr zing a, Pathien bâwm lei khan a lungrilin ân thin ân thin a. Chun, ama chun khuo a hang tlung a, chanchin chu a hang hril chun a khuoin an khêk ta veng vung el a."
14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli.","Eli chun an khêkri chu a lo hrietin, “Chu inri mur mur chu iengtizie am a na?” a ta. Chun, mi chu inhmawtakin a va feh a. Eli chu a va hril a."
15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.","Eli chu kum sâwmkuo le kum riet mi a na, a mit ân thim tah a, khuo a hmu thei ta nawh a."
16,"And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my son?","Chun, mi chun Eli kuoma chun, “Sipai laia inthawka hung ka ni hi, vawisûn hin sipai laia inthawka hung tlân ka nih,” a ta. Ama chun, “ka naupa, ieng angin am thil a um a?” a ta."
17,"And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.","Chanchin hung intluntu chun a dawn a, “Israel mihai chu Philistin mihai hmaa chun an tlânseh a; chun, mipui lai chun inthatna nasatak a um bawk a; i naupahai pahni Hophni le Phinehas khawm an thih a; Pathien bâwm khawm an lâkpêk tah,” a ta."
18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.","Chun, Pathien bâwm thu a hang hril phingle chun kawtkhâr bula ṭhungnaa inthawk chun a thalin a tluh a, a ring a tliek a, a thi tah a, ama hi a tar êm leiin ân dâwl zo ta naw a nih. Israel chunga kum sâwmli rorêl tah a nih."
19,"And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon her.","Chun, a monu Phinehas nu- hmei chun nau a vawn a, a nei a hnai ta hleh a, Pathien bâwm an lâkpêk ti thu a hang hriet a, a tarpupa le a pasal an thi ti a hang hriet chun, a kûn a, nau chu a nei tah a, a nauha chun ama a hung nang nghâl ta sih a."
20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.","Chun, a thi vâng vâng laia a kâwla ngîr nuhmeihai chun a kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh, naupasal i nei ta hi,” an ta. Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a dawn dêr nawh a, a ngaisak bawk nawh a."
21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.","Chun, “Ropuina chun Israel- hai chu a suoksan tah,” tiin, nau- pang hminga chun Ikabod a sak a. Pathien bâwm chu an lâkpêk tah a, a tarpupa le a pasal khawm an thi ta sih a."
22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.","“Ropuina chun Israel chu a suoksan tah a, Pathien bâwm chu an lâkpêk ta sih a,” a ta."
