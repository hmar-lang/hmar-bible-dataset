1,"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a naupa Jonathan le a siehlaw- hai po po chu David chu that dingin a hril a."
2,"And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:","Nisienlakhawm, Saula naupa Jonathan chun David chu a ngaina hle el a. Chuongchun, Jonathan chun David chu, “Ka pa Saula chun that a tum cheh a, chuleiin, zîngah zîngkâr chun fîmkhur la, hmun inthupah inbi zing raw khai;"
3,"and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.","chun, fe suok ka ta, i umna phûlah ka pa kâwlah va ngîr ka ta, i chungchâng thuah ka pa bieng ka ta, ieng amanih ka hriet chun hril ka ti che,” a ta."
4,"And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:","Chun, Jonathan chun a pa Saula hmaa chun David chu ân pâk a, a kuomah, “Lal chun a siehlaw chung- ah, David chunga hin thil suol thaw lul naw raw se, i chungah iengkhawm a suksuol si nawh a, a thilthawhai chu i ta dinga ṭhatak a ni sih a;"
5,"for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?","thi dâwn loin Philistin mi kha a thawh a, chun LALPAIN Israel mihai po po sandamna ropuitak a thaw- suokpêk a, chu chu nang khawma i hmuh a, lâwm khawm i lâwm hle kha; chuleiin, a san iengkhawm um loa David chu thatin, ieng dingin am thisen pawi tâwklo chunga chun thil suksuol el i ta?” a ta."
6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death.","Chuongchun, Saula chun Jona- than rawl chu a ngai a, Saula chun, “Ṭawng inkhâmin, LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ama chu sukhlum ni naw tawp a tih,” a ta."
7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime.","Chun, Jonathan chun David chu a ko a, Jonathan chun chuong thil po po chu a hril a. Chun, Jonathan chun David chu Saula kuoma chun a ṭhuoi a, inhma ang bawk khan a kuoma chun a um nâwk tah a."
8,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.","Chun, indona a hung um nâwk a, chuongchun, David chu ân thawk suok a, Philistin mihai chu a va thawh a, a va that ṭeu a, a hmaa chun an tlânseh a."
9,"And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.","Chun, Saula chu a ina fei chawia a ṭhung laiin LALPA tir khawhri a chungah a hung tlung a; chun, David chun ṭingṭang a kei a."
10,"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.","Chun, Saula chun a fei chun David chu banga khâwde tlat a tum a; nisienlakhawm, Saula kuoma in- thawk chun a fe hmang vat a, fei chu banga chun a khâw bûr ta chut el a; chun, David chu a tlân suok a, chu zân chun a him tah a."
11,"And Saul sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.","Chun, Saula chun David chu in tienga zîngkâra lo inchâna that dingin mi a tir a; chun, David nuhmei Mikal chun, “Vawizân hin i hringna i humhim naw chun, zînga hin an that ding che a nih,” tiin a hril a."
12,"So Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.","Chuongchun, Mikal chun David chu tukverah a thlâk thla a, chuongchun, a tlân hmang a, a him tah a."
13,"And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair at the head thereof, and covered it with the clothes.","Chun, Mikal chun milim chu a lâk a, khuma chun ân zâltir a; chun, a lu tieng chun kêl hmul lukham a sieh a, puonin ân khum a."
14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.","Chun, David ṭhuoi dinga Saulan mi a hung tir chu, “A dam nawh,” a lo ta."
15,"And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.","Chun, Saula chun David va en dingin mi a tir a, “A khum pumin hung zâwn suok unla, lo that el ka tih,” a ta."
16,"And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at the head thereof.","Chun, a mi tirhai chu an va lût chun, ngai ta, khuma chun milim chu a lu tienga kêl hmul lukham khamin a lo um a."
17,"And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, so that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?","Saula chun Mikal kuoma chun, “Ieng dinga hienga i mi hlêm a, a himna dinga ka hmêlma chu în suoktir am a na?” a ta."
18,"Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.","Tûn David chu a tlân hmang a, a him tah a, Rama khuoa Samuel kuomah a va tlung a, a chunga Saula thilthawhai po po chu a hril a. Chun, ama le Samuel chu an feh a, Naiothah an um a."
19,"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.","Chun, Saula chu, “Ngai ta, David chu Rama khuoa Naiothah a um” ti an hril a."
20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.","Chuongchun, David chu va ṭhuoi dingin Saula chun mitirhai a tir a, chun, zâwlnei ruolin thu an hril duol duol lai le Samuel an chunga hotua um an va hmu chun, Saula mitirhai chunga chun Pathien thlarau a hung tlung a, anni khawm chun thu an hril ve ta duol duol a."
21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.","Chu chu Saula an hang hril chun, mi dang a tir nâwk a, anni khawm chun thu an va hril ve ta duol duol el a."
22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.","Chuongchun, ama khawm chu Rama khuoa chun a fe ve tah a; chun, Seku hmuna tuisunsuo lientak hmun chu a va tlung a, “Samuel le David hi khâwlai am an um a?” tiin ân dawn a. Chun, tuin amani hin, “Ngai ta, Rama khuoa Naiothah an um,” a ta."
23,"And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.","Chuongchun, Rama khuoa Naiotha chun a feh a, chun, Pathien thlarau chu a chunga chun a hung tlung ve tah a, a fe pei a, Rama khuoa Naioth a tlung hmakhat chun thu a hril malam pei a."
24,"And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?","Chun, ama khawmin a silfênhai a hlîp veh a, Samuel hmaa chun thu a hril ve ta nuk nuk a, chu ni zânkhuo le sûnnithlâk chun ruokin a zâl a. Chuleiin, “Saula khawm chu zâwl- neihai lai a ṭhang ve el am a ni tah?” ti hi an chîng sawng tah a."
