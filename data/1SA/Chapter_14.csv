1,"Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father.","Ni khat chu Saula naupa Jonathan chun a râlthuom chawitu tlangvâl kuoma chun, “Hung ta, khingtieng râl Philistin mi râl vêngtu sipaihai umnaa sawn va fêng ei tih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, a pa chu a hril nawh a."
2,And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;,Saula chu Gibea ram hmawr tieng daia Migrona theibufai kûng hnuoiah a um a; a kuoma mi umhai chu za ruk amani lai an na.
3,"and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.","Chun, Silo khuoa thiempu Eli naupa Phinehas naupa Ikabod naupa Ahitub naupa Ahija chu thiempu zakawsîng hâkin a um veh a. Chun, Jonathan chu a fe ti mipuihai chun an hriet nawh a."
4,"And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.","Jonathanin Philistin mi râl vêngtu sipaihai umnaa fe a tumna kâwn le kâwn inkâra chun a khingtieng khingtieng chun lungpui indaw a um a, pakhat hming chu Bozez a na, a pakhat hming chu Sene a nih."
5,"The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.","Lungpui indaw pakhat chu Mikmas hmârtieng panga um a na, a dang pakhat chu Geba zâwn simtieng panga um a nih."
6,"And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.","Chun, Jonathan chun, a râl- thuom chawitu tlangvâl kuoma chun, “Hung rawh, sertan lo sipaihai umnaa sawn va fêng ei tih; LALPA chun thil a mi thawpêk khiet rawi mawh; LALPA ta ding chun a tam amanih, a tlâwm amaniha sandam chu ieng- khawm a thei nawna a um chuong si nawh a,” a ta."
7,"And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.","Chun, a râlthuom chawitu chun a kuomah, “I lungrila um angtak chun thaw rawh, ngai ta, i lungril angtak chu ka lungril a nih,” a ta."
8,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chun “Hung ta, an kuoma sawn va kai ei ta, vân suklang ei tih."
9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.","Chun, ei kuomah, ‘In kuoma kan hung hmakhat chun la um ro,’ an mi ti chun, ei hmuna chun ngîr zing ei ta,an kuomah hang fe nâwng ei ta,"
10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up; for Jehovah hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign unto us.","‘Kan kuom tieng hin hung ro,’ an ti ruok chun hang fêng ei ta, LALPAIN ei kutah a mi pêk a ni tah ti inchikna ning a tih,” a ta."
11,"And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.","Chun, an pahni chun Philistin mi râl vêngtu sipaihai hmuna chun an vân suklang a, chun, Philistin mihai chun, “En ta u, Hebrai mihai an inbîkna khursûnga inthawkin an hung suok tah,” an ta."
12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.","Chun, râl vêngtu sipaihai umnaa mihai chun Jonathan le a râlthuom chawitu chu, “Hung unla, thil ieng amanih lo inentir kan ti cheu,” tiin an lo ko a. Chun, Jonathan chun a râlthuom chawitu kuoma chun, “Mi hung zui raw khai, LALPA chun anni chu Israelhai kutah a pêk tah a nih,” a ta."
13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chu a kut le a ke hmangin a hang lâwn a, a râlthuom chawitu chun a zui a; chun, anni chu Jonathan hmaa chun an tlu ta zawt zawt a, a râlthuom chawitu chun a hung that ve pei a."
14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.","Chuongchun, Jonathan le a râlthuom chawituin an that hmasa tak ṭum chun ṭin chenve hmun ding ang vêla hin mi sâwmhni amani lai an that a nih."
15,"And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.","Chun, riekhmuna mihai, phûla mi dâm, mipuihai po po chu an inthin a; chun, râl vêngtu sipaihai le râlrûkhai khawm chu an inthin veh a, chun, simkhawleihnuoi ân hning a, nasataka inthinna a um a."
16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went hither and thither.","Chun, Benjamin ram Gibeaa Saula râl vêngtuhai chun an hang thlîr vêl a, ngai ta, mipuihai chu an ṭe dar hum hum a, khingtieng khing- tiengah an invâk nuoi nuoi el a."
17,"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a kuoma mipui umhai kuoma chun, “Tuhin intiem unla, tuhai hai am an na a kim naw?” a ta. Chun, an hang intiem chun ngai ta, Jonathan le a râlthuom chawitu chu an lo um ve ta nawh a."
18,"And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was there at that time with the children of Israel.","Chun, Saula chun Ahija kuoma chun, “Pathien bâwm chu hang la raw khai,” a tih a. Chuong lai chun Pathien bâwm chu Israel thlahai laia um a na."
19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.","Chun, hieng hi a hung na, Saulân thiempu a biek zing lai dâm chun Philistin mihai riekhmun tienga buoi mur mur chu a zuol ta deu deu a; Saula chun thiempu kuoma chun, “I kut la kîr rawh,” a ta."
20,"And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.","Chuongchun, Saula le mipuihai po po chu an fe khâwm a, indonaa chun an fe tah a; chun, anni le anni kâwlhnâma lo inthaw rak a, lo buoi nuk nuk chu an hmu a."
21,"Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp, from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.","Chuongchun, chuong lai ram vêla mi riekhmuna hang fe ve, kha hma tienga Philistin mihai kuoma ṭhang Hebrai mihai khawm chu Saula le Jonathan kuoma um Israel mihai kuoma chun an hung ṭhang ve tah a."
22,"Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.","Chuong ang bawkin Ephraim tlâng rama Israel mi inbihmang po pohai khawm khan Philistin mihai an tlânhmang ti an lo hriet a, anni khawm chun indonaa chun ṭhangin an hnawt zui ve ta ngat ngat a."
23,So Jehovah saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth-aven.,"Chuongchun, LALPAIN chu ni chun Israel mihai chu a sanhim tah a, chun, Beth-aven tlung rakin an thawh a."
24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.","Chun, chu ni chun Israel mihai chu an lunginzîng a; nisienlakhawm, Saula chun, “Ka hmêlmahai chunga phuba ka lâk a, khuo a hung inhnu hmaa tukhawma bu a fâk chun ṭawng-sephurin um raw se,” tiin mi- pui chu a vau a. Chuongchun, tu- khawma bu chu intem khawm an intem dêr nawh a."
25,And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.,"Chun, mipui po pohai chun ramhnuoi an va tlung a, hnuoia chun khuoizu dâm a lo um a."
26,"And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.","Chun, mipuiin ramhnuoi an va tlung chun khuoizu dâm a lo luong a, nisienlakhawm, tukhawma an liek nawh, mipuihai chun inkhâmna chu an ṭi a nih."
27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.","Nisienlakhawm, Jonathan chu a pa chun mipuihai chu inkhâma a vau lai a hriet ve nawh a; chuongchun a hmawl chawi hmawr chu khuoi- thlâra chun a sunphûm a, a liek a, chuongchun, a mit meng chu a hung fie tah a."
28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day. And the people were faint.","Chuongchun, mipui laia mi pakhat chun a lo dawn a, “I pa chun mipuihai hi, ‘Vawisûna bu fa taphawt chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se,’ tiin a mi vau tlat a, mipuihai khawm an chau hle hrim a,” a ta."
29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chun, “Ka pa hin mihai a suklunginzing el a ni hi maw, en ta unla, khuoizu tlâwmte ka hang intem lei chauin ka mit meng a fie tâkzie hi."
30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now hath there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.","Mipui hin an râllâk thil an hmu taphawt vawisûn hin an nuom nuomin fa thei hai sienla lem chu a va nasa nâwkzuol âwm de! chu lei tak chun Philistin mihai chu ei that nasa thei naw pha a ni hi,” a ta."
31,And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint;,"Chuongchun, chu ni chun Mikmasa inthawkin Aijalon chenin Philistin mihai chu an thawh a; chun, mipuihai chu an châu hle el tah a."
32,"and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood.","Chuongchun, mipuihai chun an râllâk thilhai chu a bawin an bawh a, berâmhai, bâwngchalhai, kêltehai an man a, hnuoia chun an sukhlum a, mipuihai chun a thisen pumin an fâk el tah a."
33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone unto me this day.","Chuongchun, “Ngai ta, mipui- hai chun thisen puma fain LALPA chungah thil an suksuol tah,” tiin, Saula chu an hril a. Chun, ama chun, “Ringmawumtakin thil in thaw a nih, lung lientak mi hung inhlumpêk ro,” a ta."
34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.","Chun, Saula chun, “Mipuihai lai chun invâk dar vawng unla, an kuomah, ‘Mi tinin a sebâwng le berâm ka kuomah hung la sienla, hitaka hin hung that sienla, fa raw se, a thisen puma faa LALPA chunga thil suksuol loin, a tih,’ va ti ro khai,” a ta. Chun, chu zân chun mi po po chun mâni bâwngchal an hung kei seng a, chutaka chun an that a."
35,And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah: the same was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah.,"Chun, Saula chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a, chu chu LALPA ta dinga mâichâm siem hmasa tak a nih."
36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.","Chun, Saula chun, “Zânah Philistin mihai chu zu thaw inla, zîng khawvar chenin rawk ei tiu khai, tukhawm hla hrim hrim nâwng ei tiu,” a ta. Chun, anni chun, “Ṭha i ti ang angin thaw rawh,” an ta. Thiem- pu ruok chun, “Hi lai hin Pathien hnai phawt ei tiu khai,” a ta."
37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.","Chun, Saula chun Pathien a râwn a, “Philistin mihai chu ka zu thaw ding am a nih? Israelhai kutah i pêk ding am a nih?” a ta. Nisienla- khawm, chu ni chun a dawn nawh a."
38,"And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.","Chun, Saula chun, “Nangni mipui hotuhai po po kha hung hnai ta u khai, vawisûn hin a ieng tak am ei thaw suol a na ti hriet tum ei tiu khai."
39,"For, as Jehovah liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.","Israelhai sandam hlaktu LAL- PA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, ka naupa Jonathan thilthawa khawm lo ni a ni chun a thi ngei ngei ding a nih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, mipui laia mi chun tukhawm a dawn hrim hrim an um nawh a."
40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.","Chuongchun, Israelhai po po kuoma chun, “Nangni hi a tumin um khâwm unla; chun, kei le ka naupa Jonathan hi a tumin um kan tih,” a ta. Chun, mipuihai chun Saula kuomah, “Ṭha i ti ang angin thaw rawh,” an ta."
41,"Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot; but the people escaped.","Chuongchun, Saula chun LAL- PA Israelhai Pathien kuoma chun, “Ân diktak chu hung suklang rawh,” a ta; chun, aisan chu Jonathan le Saula chunga chun a tluh a, mipuihai ruok chu an fihlim a."
42,"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.","Chun, Saula chun, “Kei le ka naupa Jonathan hriet ṭhena dingin aisân ro,” a ta."
43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chunga chun a tlu tah a. Chun, Saula chun Jonathan kuoma chun, “Iengam a na i thaw mi hril raw khai?” a ta. Chun, Jonathan chun a hril a, “Ka hmawl chawi hmawrin khuoizu tlâwmte chu kân tem ngei el a, ngai ta, ka thi ngei ding a nih,” a ta."
44,"And Saul said, God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.","Chun, Saula chun, “Pathien chun a thaw thawin thaw el sienla, chu nêka nasa khawma, i thi ngei ding a nih, Jonathan,” a ta."
45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.","Chun, mipuihai chun Saula kuoma chun, “Israelhai laia hi san- damna ropuitak thawtu Jonathan hi a thi el ding maw? Teu lo e, LALPA hringna sâlin kan hril a nih, a sam zai khat khawm hi hnuoia tla hlek naw nih; vawisûn hin Pathien sin a thaw- pui a ni sih a,” an ta. Chuongchun, mipui chun Jonathan chu thi lo dingin an sanhim tah a."
46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.,"Chuongchun, Saulan Philistin mihai a hnawt chu a kîrsan tah a; chun, Philistin mihai khawm chu anni umna hmunah an fe tah a."
47,"Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he put them to the worse.","Saula chu Israelhai chunga rorêltua a hang ṭhang chun kil tina a hmêlma, Moab mihai, Ammon thla- hai, Edom mihai, Zoba lalhai dâm, Philistin mihai chu a do a; ân herna tienga taphawt chu a hne pei el a."
48,"And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that despoiled them.","Huoitakin a thawh a, Amalek mihai chu a hneh a, Israel mihai chu anni rawk hlaktuhai kuta inthawkin a sansuok a nih."
49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:","Saula naupasalhai chu Jona- than hai, Isvi hai, Malkisua hai an na, chun a naunuhmei pahnihai hming chu hieng hi a nih: a upa lem hming chu Merab a na, a naupang lem hming chu Mikal a nih."
50,"and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.","Saula nuhmei hming chu Ahinoam, Ahimaaz naunu a nih. A sipai hotuhai hming chu Abner, Saula pami Nera naupa a nih."
51,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.,"Kis chu Saula pa a na, chun, Abner pa Nera chu Abiel naupa a nih."
52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.","Chuongchun, Saula dam sûng po po chun Philistin mihai le hin nasatakin an indo hlak a; chun, Saula chun mi hrât amanih, mi huoi amanih a hmu taphawt chu a lâk pei hlak a nih."
