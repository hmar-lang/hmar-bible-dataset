1,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to him.","Chuongchun, David chu chutaka inthawk chu a suok a, Adullam pûkah a tlân tah a; chun, a unauhai le a pa sûngkuohai po poin an lo hriet chun chutaka chun a kuomah an zu feh a."
2,"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.","Chun, mi lunginzing taphawthai, leibat nei taphawthai, lungninawna nei taphawthai chu a kuomah an fe khâwm a; chuongchun, an hotuah a um tah a, chun a kuoma chun mi za li lai an um tah a."
3,"And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.","Chun, David chu chutaka inthawk chun Moab rama Mizpe-ah a feh a, Moab lal kuoma chun, “Pathien thil mi thawpêk ding ka hriet hmakhat chu ka nu le ka pa hung hai sien, i kuomah lo um raw hai se, ka hni che a nih,” a ta."
4,And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.,"Chun, Moab lal hmaa chun anni chu a hung ṭhuoi a, kulbînga a um sûng po chun a kuoma chun an um tah a."
5,"And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.","Chun, zâwlnei Gad chun David kuomah, “Kulbînga hin um zing naw rawh, suok la, Judai ramah fe rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chu a suok a, Hereth ramhnuoia chun a lût tah a."
6,"And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.","Chun, Saula chun David le a kuoma umhai chu an hmu tah ti a lo hriet a, Saula chu Gibeaah Rama khuoa tamarisk thing hnuoiah a fei chawiin a ṭhung a; chun, a vêla chun a siehlawhai po po chu an ngîr a."
7,"And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,","Chun, Saula chun a kâwl vêla ngîr a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “Nangni Benjamin thlahai lo ngai unla, Jesai naupa chun lohai, grêp huonhai pe seng cheuin, a sipai sâng hotuahai, a sipai za hotuahai a siem vawng ding cheu am a nih?"
8,"that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?","in rêngin in mi enbing a, ka naupain Jesai naupa kuoma thu a ithlung ka kuoma suklang hrim hrim in um nawh a, a mi lungngaipui hrim hrim khawm in um nawh a, ka naupain ka siehlaw hi mi do ding le vawisûn ni chen khawma min chân dinga ân fui thu ka kuoma suklang hrim iengdinga in um naw?” a ta."
9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.","Chuongchun, Saula siehlawhai kâwla ngîr Edom mi Doeg chun a dawn a, “Jesai naupa chu Nob khuoa Ahitub naupa Ahimelek kuoma a hung ka hmuh a."
10,"And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.","Chun, ama chun LALPA a rawnpêk a, fâk ding a pêk a; chun, Philistin mi Goliath kâwlhnâm a pêk bawk a,” a ta."
11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.","Chuongchun, lal chun Ahitub naupa Ahimelek thiempu le, a pa sûngkuo Nob khuoa thiempu um po po chu ân kotir a; anni chu an rêngin lal kuoma chun an hung a."
12,"And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.","Chun, Saula chun, “Nang Ahitub naupa, lo ngai rawh,” a ta. Ama chun, “Ka lalpa, hitaka hin ka um,” a ta."
13,"And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?","Chun, Saulain a kuomah, “Bei le kâwlhnâm dâm lo pe a, LALPA chu rawnpêkin vawisûn nia a thaw anga mi do ding le min chân dinga ieng- dinga nang le Jesai naupa hin in mi phierrûk am a na?” a ta."
14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into thy council, and is honorable in thy house?","Chuongchun, Ahimelek chun lal chu a dawn a, “Lal mâkpa, i mi rawntak hlak, in sûngkuo laia mi inzaum David ang hrim hrima mi ringum hi i siehlaw po pohai lai hin tu am a um a?"
15,"Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute anything unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.","Vawisûn hi Pathien ka biek râwnpêk ṭan ni am a nih? A ni nawh. Lal hin a siehlaw amanih, ka pa sûngkuo hrim hrim hi min tum lul naw raw se, i siehlaw hin hieng thu po po a iengkhawm hi ka hriet naw a nih,” a ta."
16,"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.","Chun, lal chun, “Ahimelek, i thi ngei ngei ding a nih, nang le i pa sûngkuohai po po leh,” a ta."
17,"And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of Jehovah; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.","Chun, lal chun a kâwla ngîr sipai kuoma chun, “Nghakîr unla, LALPA thiempuhai hi that ro, David tieng an ṭhang a, a tlân hmang a nih ti hre zing siin ka kuoma an hril naw leiin,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, lal sie- hlawhai chun LALPA thiempuhai thaw ding chun kut an inlet nuom nawh a."
18,"And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.","Chun, lal chun Doeg kuoma chun, “Nang nghakîr la, thiempuhai kha thaw rawh,” a ta. Edom mi Doeg chu a nghakîr a, thiempuhai chu a thawh a, chu ni chun puon zai inhmi sil thiempu zakawsîng hâk, mi sâwmriet le panga a that a."
19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword.","Chun, Nob, thiempu khuo chu kâwlhnâmin a thawh a, a nuhmei a pasalin naupang le nênê ne lai chen- in, bâwnghai, sabengtunghai, berâm- hai leh kâwlhnâmin a sât hlum a."
20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.","Chun, Ahitub naupa Ahimelek naupasalhai laia pakhat a hming Abiathar chu a tlân suok a, David kuomah a tlân a."
21,And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Jehovah’s priests.,"Chun, Abiathar chun Saulain LALPA thiempuhai a that thu chu David a hril a."
22,"And David said unto Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father’s house.","David chun Abiathar kuoma chun, “Edom mi Doeg chutaka a um ni ngei khan Saula hril ngei ngei a tih ti ka hriet sa hrim a nih; I pa sûng- kuohai po po chu keia leia thi an nih."
23,"Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: for with me thou shalt be in safeguard.","Nang chu ka kuomah um la ṭi naw rawh; kei mi that tum chun nang khawm that tum ngei an ti che; ka kuoma i um ruok chun chu him i tih,” a ta."
