1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.","Chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun Israel mihai chu an do a, chun, Israel mihai chu Philistin mihai hmaa chun an tlânseh a: Gilboa tlânga chun thatin an um ta zul el a."
2,"And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Saula le a naupasalhai chu an hnawt zui ta ngat ngat a; chun, Philistin mihai chun Saula naupasalhai, Jonathan le Abinadab le Malkisua chu an that a."

4,"Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.","Chuongchun, Saula chun a râl- thuom chawitu kuoma chun, “I kâwlhnâm kha phawi la, mi hang sunthleng rawh, chuong naw chun hieng sertanlohai hi hung an ta, mi hung sunthleng an ta, mi uongkhum nghe nghe rawi an tih,” a ta. Nisien- lakhawm, a râlthuom chawitu chun a thaw nuom nawh a, a ṭi êm êm el sih a. Chuleiin, Saula chun kâwlhnâm chu a lâk a, a bawlût tah a."
5,"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.","Chun, a râlthuom chawitu chun Saula a thi ti a hriet chun, ama khawm chun a kâwlhnâm chu a bawlût veh a, an thi rêl tah a."
6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together.","Chuongchun, Saula leh, a nau- pasal pathumhai leh, a râlthuom chawitu leh, a mihai po po leh, chu ni ngei chun an thi seng tah a nih."
7,"And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.","Chun, ruom râl khingtienga Israel mi umhai le Jordan râla um- haiin Israel mihai an tlânsie ti le Saula le a naupasalhai an thi ti an hriet chun, khuohai chu an suoksan a, an tlânhmang tah a; chun, Phi- listin mihai chun an va hluo tah a."
8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.","Chun, a zînga chun Philistin mihaiin an râl thathai thuom hlîppêk dinga an va fe chun Saula le a naupasal pathumhai Gilboa tlânga an lo thi chu an va hmuh a."
9,"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.","Chun, a lu chu an tan a, a râlthuom chu an hlîp a, chanchin chu an milim biekna ina le mihai kuoma phuong dingin Philistin rama chun an inphur vêl a."
10,And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.,"A râlthuom chu Astaroth inah an sieh a, a ruong chu Bethsan kul banga chun an târ a."
11,"And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,","Chun, Jabes-gileada umhaiin Philistin mihaiin Saula an thaw dân chungchâng thu chu an lo hriet chun,"
12,"all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.","mi huoisenhai po po chu an tho a, zânkhawvârin an feh a, Saula ruong le a naupasalhai ruong Beth- san kul banga inthawk chun an lâk a; chun, Jabes an hung tlung a; chutaka chun an rawh a."
13,"And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.","Chun, an ruhai chu an lâk a, Jabesa tamarisk thing hnuoiah an phûm a; chun, ni sari bu an nghei a."
