1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun indo dingin an sipaihai an kei khâwm ṭeu el a. Judai ram sûng Soko khuoah an pungkhâwm a; Ephes- dammim hmunah Soko khuo le Azeka khuo inkâra chun ṭhanghmun an khuor a."
2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.","Chun, Saula le Israel mihai chu an pungkhâwm a, Ela ruomah ṭhang- hmun an khuor a, Philistin mihai chu lo dang dingin an inzar dar a."
3,"And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.","Chun, Philistin mihai chu tlâng pangah an um a, chun, Israel mihai chu khingtieng tlâng panga chun an um a, an inkâra chun ruom a um a."
4,"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.","Chun, Philistin mihai ṭhang- hmuna inthawk chun an mi hrât, Goliath, Gath khuoa mi, tawng ruk le khâp khata insâng hi a hung suok a."
5,"And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.","Dâr lukhum hi a khum a, âwmphaw a hâk a, a âwmphaw rikzie chu dâr shekel sâng nga a nih."
6,"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.","A ngala chun dâr ngalphaw a bun a, a ruongzânga chun dâr feite a pai a."
7,And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.,"A fei ngul chu puonkawl ang hi a na, a fei lu chu thîr shekel za ruka rik a nih; chun, a phaw chawitu chu a hmaa chun a feh a."
8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.","Chun, a ngîr a, Israelhai sipaihai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Iengdinga indo dinga in hung inzar dar am a na? Kei Philistin mi, nangni Saula siehlawhai in nih a ni naw am a nih? Mi inthlang unla, ka kuomah hung thla raw se."
9,"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.","A mi thaw thei a, a mi sukhlum chun in siehlawah um kan ta, ami- ruokchu, keiin ka ngam a, ka sukhlum chun kan siehlawah um in ta, kan rawngbâwl in tih,” a ta."
10,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.","Chun, Philistin mi chun, “Vawi- sûn hin chu Israelhai sipaihai chu ka cho a nih, mi pakhat hung thaw unla, lo inthâwng kan tih,” a ta."
11,"And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.","Chun, Saula le Israelhai po poin chu Philistin mi thuhril an hriet chun an ṭih a, an inlau ta êm êm el a."
12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men.","Chun, David chu Jesai naupa a na, ama chu Bethlehem-Judaa Ephrath mi kha a na, naupasal pariet a nei a; ama chu Saula inlal lai chun tartak a ni tah a, tarsiea ngai a ni tah."
13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.","Chun, Jesai naupasal upahai pathum chun indonaa chun Saula an zui a. A naupasal pathum indonaa fehai hming chu a upa tak Eliab hai, a dawttu Abinadab hai, a pathumna chu Samma hai an nih."
14,And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.,"Chun, David chu a naupang tak a na, chun, a upahai pathum chun Saula an zui a."
15,Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Beth-lehem.,David chu Saula kuoma in- thawkin a pa berâm enkawl dingin Bethlehema chun a va fe a va fe hlak a.
16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.","Chun, Philistin mi chun zîngkâr le zântieng po hin a va hnai hlak a, ni sâwmli sûng zet chu a vân târlang hlak a."
17,"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren;","Chun, Jesai chun a naupa David kuoma chun, “Bu zeu epha khat le hi bei tlang sâwm hi chawi la, i unauhai kuomah riekhmunah va fepui vak raw khai;"
18,"and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.","chun, nêne tui kîng tlang sâwm hi an pâwla sâng hotu chawipêk la, chun, i unauhai iengtin am an um hung indawn la, an chanchin hrietna hung phur rawh."
19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.","Saula le anni le Israel mi po po chu Philistin mihai doin Ela ruoma chun tûn an um a nih,” a ta."
20,"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.","Chun, David chu zîngkâr a tho a, berâmhai chu vêngtu pakhat ân kawltir a, Jesaiin thu a pêk ang chun a chawi a, a fe tah a; chun, indona hmuna suok mêk sipaihai chu inthaw dinga an lo khêk dur dur lai takin ama chu tawlailîr umna hmun chu a va tlung a."
21,"And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.","Chun, Israel mihai le Philistin mihai chu indo ding chun an lo inzar a, sipai le sipai chu an lo inep a."
22,"And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren.","Chun, David chun a thuom- hnaw chu thuomhnaw enkawltu kuoma chun a sieh a, indona hmun tieng chun a va tlân a; a uhai chu chibai a va bûk a."
23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.","Chun, anni a biek lai chun, ngai ta, an mi hrât Gath khuoa Philistin mi a hming Goliath chu Philistin mihai sipai pâwl laia chu a hung suok a, a thuhril ngai bawk kha a hung hril a, chu chu David chun a lo hriet zing a."
24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.","Israel mihai po po chun ama chu an hei hmu chun an tlânseh a, an ṭi êm êm el a."
25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.","Chun, Israel mihai chun, “Kha mihriem a hung suokpa kha in hmu am? Israel mihai cho dinga hung suok a ni ngei el; tukhawm ama sukhlum taphawt chu lalin ama chu sum tiengin sukhausâng a ta; chun, a nau- nu pêng a ta, chun, a pa sûngkuohai chu Israelhai lai hin zalênin inumtir a tih,” an ta."
26,"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?","Chun, David chun a kâwla ngîrhai kuoma chun, “Hi Philistin mi hi sukhlum a, Israelhai hmingsietna sukbotu chu iengti anga thaw ding am nîng a ta? Hi sertan lo Philistin mi hi tu am a na Pathien hring sipaihai a hei cho vei chu?” a ta."
27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.","Chun, mipuihai chun hieng ang hin an dawn a, “A sukhlumtu ta- phawt chu kan hril anga kha thaw ding a nih,” an ta."
28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.","Chun, a u, a upa tak Eliab chun mihai kuoma a thu hril lai chu a lo hriet a: chuongchun, Eliab chu David chunga chun a lunginsen ta thut a, “Iengdinga i hung thla ve am a na? Thlalêra berâm tlâwmte um kha tu am în vêngtir leh? I chapozie le i lungril ṭhat nawzie ka hriet a nih: indo dâm en dingin i hung vei rawk a,” a ta."
29,"And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?","Chun, David chun, “Ieng am ka thaw ta leh? A san a um a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
30,"And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.","Chun, ama chun mi dang kuom tieng a nghatsan a, a hril ngai bawk a hril a; chun, mipuihai chun a hmaa an dawn ang bawk khan an dawn a."
31,"And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.","Chun, David thuhril chu an hrietin Saula kuomah an hrilsâwng a; chun, ama chun a ko a."
32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.","Chun, David chun Saula kuom- ah, “Ama lei chun tu lungril khawm ṭi naw raw se; i siehlaw hin chu Philistin mi chu va thâwng ka tih,” a ta."
33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.","Chun, Saulân David kuomah, “Nang chu, hi Philistin mi hi thaw dingin fe thei êm naw ti nih ie, tleirâwl el i la ni sih a, ama chu a tleirâwl tîra inthawka indo mi a ni sih a,” a ta."
34,"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,","Chun, David chun Saula kuom- ah, “I siehlaw hin ka pa berâm ka vêng hlak a, sakeibaknei amanih, savawm amanih a hunga berâm ruol laia berâmte dâm a lâk hin,"
35,"I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.","ka hnawt a, ka thawh a, a baua inthawk chu ka sansuok hlak a nih; chun, mi thaw dinga a hung inthawk dâm hin a bakhmulah ka man a, ka thawh a, ka sukhlum hlak a nih."
36,"Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.","I siehlaw hin sakeibaknei le savawm khawm ka sukhlum ve ve ta hlak a; chu sertan lo Philistin mi chu anni ang bawk chun um ve el a ti maw le, Pathien hring sipaihai a cho vei a,” a ta."
37,"And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.","Chun, David chun, “Sakeibak- nei kutbâwra inthawk le, savawm kutbâwra inthawka mi sansuoktu LALPA chun chu Philistin mi kuta inthawk chun mi sansuok a tih,” a ta. Chun, Saula chun David kuoma chun, “Fe raw le, i kuomah LALPA um a tih” a ta."
38,"And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.","Chun, Saula chun David chu ama thuomin a thuom a, dâr lukhum ân khumtir a, âwmphaw ân hâktir a,"
39,"And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.","Chun, David chun thuom chunga chun a kâwlhnâm a pai a, fe a hang tum a, chuong ang chun a la thaw sin ngai si nawh a. Chun, David chun Saula kuomah, “Ka fepui thei dêr âwm nawh a, hieng ang hin ka la thaw sin ngai nawha a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, David chu ân hlîp tah a."
40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.","Chun, a hmawl chu a chawi a, vadungtêa lung inmûm ṭhelṭhawl panga a thlang a, a berâm vêngna mansaa chun a pai a; chun, a vailungdêng chu a chawi a, Philistin mi chu a va hnai tah a."
41,And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.,"Chun, Philistin mi chu a hung a, David chu a hung pan hnai a; chun, phaw chawitu chu a hmaa chun a feh a."
42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance.","Chun, Philistin mi chu a hang ngha vêl a, David chu a hmu chun a hmusit hle el a; sâr hlerhlawr, mit meng mawitak, tleirâwl el a ni sih a."
43,"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.","Chun, Philistin mi chun David kuoma chun, “Ui am ka nia hmawl le dâm i mi hung pan chu le?” a ta. Chuongchun, Philistin mi chun a pathienhai sâlin David chu ṭawngsie ân phur tah a."
44,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.","Philistin mi chun David kuom- ah, “Hung ta, i sahai kha ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai lo infâktir ka tih,” a ta."
45,"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.","Chuongchun, David chun Philistin mi kuoma chun, “Nang chu kawlhnâm dâm, fei dâm, phaw dâm chawiin i hung inthawk a, kei chu sipaihai LALPA Israel sipaihai LAL- PA i cho hmingin ka hung inthawk lem a nih."
46,"This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,","Vawisûn hin LALPAIN nang hi ka kutah a mi pêk ding a nih, chun, that ka ti cheh a, i lu ka tanpêk ding che a nih; chun, Philistin sipaihai ruong chu vawisûn hin ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai kân fâktir ding a nih; chuongchun, hnuoi chunga mi po po hin Israelhai lai hin Pathien a um ti hre thei an tih;"
47,"and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah’s, and he will give you into our hand.","chun, hitaka pungkhâwmhai po po hin LALPA chun kâwlhnâm le feiin a sandam nawh ti hre thei an tih; indona chu LALPA indona a ni sih a, ama chun kan kuta hin nangni hi a mi pêk ding a nih,” a ta."
48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.","Chun, Philistin mi chu a hung inthawka David chu thaw dinga a hung hnai chun David chu sipaihai tieng chun Philistin mi chu thaw dingin a tlân ta vat a."
49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.","Chun, David chun a mansa chu a hang pur a, lung a keidawk a, a vailungdêng chun a hei dêng a, Philistin mi chu a bâwk taka chun a hei dêng a, a bâwka chun lung chu a lût a, a tlu bawkkhup ta dêr el a."
50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.","Chuongchun, David chun Philistin mi chu vailungdêng le lungin a ngam a, Philistin mi chu a dêng a, a that tah a; David chun kâwlhnâm a chawi dêr nawh a."
51,"Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.","Chuongchun, David chu a tlân a, Philistin mi kâwla chun a va ngîr a, a kâwlhnâm chu a lâk a, a bâwma inthawk chu a phawi a, chu chun a that a, a lu a tan tah a. Chun, Philistin mihai chun an mi hrât chu a thi ti an hriet chun an tlânse tah a."
52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.","Chun, Israel mihai le Juda mi- hai chu an tho a, an khêk a, Philistin mihai chu Gath chen le Ekron kul kawtkhâr chen rakin an hnawt tah a. Chun, Philistin mihai laia hliemhai chu Saaraim lampui intluonin Gath le Ekron chen chun an tlu phung el a nih."
53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.","Chun, Israel thlahai chun Phi- listin mihai an hnawt chu an kîrsan a, an riekhmun chu an suom tah a."
54,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.","Chun, David chun Philistin mi lu chu a lâk a, Jerusalemah a fepui a, a râlthuom ruok chu a puon inah a sieh a."
55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.","Chun, Saulan Philistin mihai thaw dinga David a fe lai a hmu khan sipai hotu Abner kuoma chun, “Abner, hi tleirâwl hi tu nau am a na?” a ta. Chun, Abner chun, “I hring- na sâlin ka hril a nih, aw lalpa, ka hriet dêr nawh a,” a ta."
56,"And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.","Chun, lal chun, “Hi naupang hi tu nau am a na, indawn suok raw khai,” a ta."
57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.","Chun, David chu Philistin mi a that a hung chu Abner chun a ṭhuoi a, Philistin mi lu chu chawi pumin Saula kuomah a fepui a."
58,"And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.","Chun, Saula chun, “Tu naupa am i nih a, tlangvâl?” a ta. David chun a dawn a, “Bethlehem mi i siehlaw Jesai naupa ka nih,” tiin, a dawn a."
