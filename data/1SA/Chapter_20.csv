1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?","Chun, David chu Rama khuoa Naiotha inthawk chu a tlân a, Jonathan kuoma chun a feh a, “Ieng am ka thaw leh? Ieng am ka bawsiet a? i pa chunga hin ieng am ka suksuol a hienga mi that tum a na?” a ta."
2,"And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.","Chun, ama chun, “That lo e a, thi naw tawp i tih, ngai ta, ka pa hin mîn hriettir loin, iengkhawm, lien sien chîn sien, a thaw ngai nawh a, ieng- dingin am hieng thu hi ka kuomah ip hlak a ta? ip naw tawp a tih,” a ta."
3,"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.","Chun, David chun, “I pa chun i mi lunginsiet dân hi a hriet chieng hle el sih a. ‘Jonathan chun hi hi chu hre kher da raw se, chuong naw chun, a lungngai âwm êm el,’ a ti nîng a tih. Amiruokchu, LALPA hringna le i hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, thina le kan inkâr chu pên khat chau a nih,” tiin a hril uor nâwk a."
4,"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chun David kuomah, “I hringnain a dit ang taphawt chun thawpêk pei ka ti che,” a ta."
5,"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.","David chun Jonathan kuomah, “Ngai ta, zinga hin thla thar a ni ding a na, lal kuoma thlaithlêng awt ngei ding ka na, nisienlakhawm, a ni thum ni zântieng chenin phûl tieng inbi- hmang dingin fe lem ka tih."
6,"If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.","I pa chun ka um naw hi hung hre suok a ni hlau chun, ‘David chun a khuo Bethlehema va fe vak dingin a mi hni a mi hnih a, an sûngkaw ta dinga an kum tin inthâwi hun a na,’ lo ti la."
7,"If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him.","‘A ṭha chu,’ a ti chun, i siehlaw chu a lung muong a ta, amiruokchu, a lung a sen chun thil ṭha naw thaw a tum a nih ti hre el rawh."
8,"Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee: but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?","Chuleiin, i siehlaw hi ṭhatakin thaw la, i siehlaw chu LALPA thu- thlungah i lûtpui ta sih a; amiruok- chu, bawsietna nei ka ni chun nangin mi that law law el rawh, iengdingin am i pa kuoma chun mi ṭhuoi kher kher i ta?” a ta."
9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?","Chun, Jonathan chun, “That lo e a, i chunga thil ṭha naw thaw ka pain a tum ka hriet phawt chun ka hril naw ding che am a nih?” a ta."
10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?","Chuongchun, David chun Jona- than kuomah, “I pa hin inrawmtakin dawn ta ang sienla che, tuin am mi hril a ta?” a ta."
11,"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.","Chun, Jonathan chun David kuomah, “Hung ta, va fêng ei tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, phûla chun an va fe rêl tah a."
12,"And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, be witness: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?","Chun, Jonathan chun David kuomah, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu hretu ni raw se, zîngah hieng tik pha hin amanih, ni thum nia manih, ka pa ka hung dâwp pha, ngai ta, David chungchâng thu hi ṭha tieng a ni chun mi hung tirin ka hril el naw ding che?"
13,"Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father.","Chun, ka pain i chungah thil ṭha naw thaw nuom ta sienla, ka hril naw cheh a, lungmuongtaka i fe theina dinga kân thla naw che chun, LALPAIN Jonathan chu a thaw thawin thaw sienla, chu nêka nasa khawmin; chun, LALPA chu i kuom- ah um raw se, ka pa kuoma a um hlak angin."
14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;","Chun, ka thi nawna dingin ka dam sûng chaua LALPA lunginsietna mîn hmutir ni loin,"
15,"but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.","kumkhawtluongin ka sûnghai chunga khawm i lunginsietna chu bo naw raw se; LALPAIN David hmêlma hnuoi chunga a sukbo vawng hnung chen khawmin ma naw rawh,” a ta."
16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.","Jonathan chun, “David hmêl- mahaia inthawkin LALPA chun phût a tih,” tiin David sûnghai kuoma chun thu a thlung a."
17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.","Chun, Jonathan chun ama a hmangaina sâlin David kuoma chun ṭawng ân khâm nâwk a, ama hring- na a hmangai ang chiein a hmangai sih a."
18,"Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.","Chuongchun, Jonathan chun a kuomah, “Zinga hin thla thar a ni ding a na, i ṭhungna hmun a ruok ding leiin i um naw chu inlang ngei ding a na."
19,"And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.","Ni thum i um hnung chun fe thla vat la, kha hmaa thil a hung um laia în bîkna hmuna khan hung la, Ezel lung bula chun um zing rawh."
20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.","Chun, inthemthiem ni âwmtak- in a sîrah thal pathum hung kâp ka ta."
21,"And, behold, I will send the lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth.","Chun, ngai ta, ‘Fe la, thalhai kha va zawng hmu rawh,’ tiin nau- pang tir ka ta. Naupang kuoma chun, ‘En ta, thalhai chu i hnungtienga kha a um ie, la la, hung rawh,’ ka ti chun, LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a, i ta dingin muong a umin ṭi ding a um naw nîng a ta."
22,"But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away.","Amiruokchu, naupang kuoma chun, ‘En ta, thalhai chu i khêltienga saw a um,’ ka ti chun, fe hmang el rawh; LALPA chun ân fe hmangtir che ning a tih."
23,"And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.","Chun, nang le keiin thil ei hril tahai chungchâng thua chun ngai ta, nang le ei inkâra chun LALPA chu a um kumkhuo a nih,” a ta."
24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.","Chuongchun, David chu phûla chun ân bihmang a, chun, thla a hung thar chun lal chu thlaithlêng awtin a ṭhung a."
25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty.","Lal chu ni danga a ṭhungna pângngai bang kâwla a ṭhungnaa chun a ṭhung a; chun, Jonathan chu a ngîr a; chun, Abner chu Saula kâwla chun a ṭhung a; David hmun ruok kha chu a ruok a."
26,"Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.","Amiruokchu, Saula chun chu ni chun iengkhawm a hril nawh a, “A chungah thil ieng am a nih a um a, ân thieng naw amanih ning a ta, a thieng naw ni ngei a tih,” a ti lungril a."
27,"And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?","Chun, thla thar a ni hni ni chun David hmun chu a la ruok ta rawp a; chuongchun, Saula chun a naupa Jonathan kuomah, “Iengdinga Jesai naupa hi zâni le vawisûn hin thlai- thlêng awt dinga hung naw am a na?” a ta."
28,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:","Jonathan chun Saula chu a dawn a, “David chun Bethlehema fe dingin a mi hni a mi hni a."
29,"and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king’s table.","‘Mîn fetir hrâm rawh khai, kan sûngkuo chun khuoa chun inthâwina an nei ding a na, ka unaupa chun um ve dingin a mîn cha tlat a; chuong- chun, i mi lunginsiet thei chun mîn fetir la, ka unauhai va sir ka tih,’ a ta. Chu lei chun lal dawkâna chun a hung naw a nih,” a ta."
30,"Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?","Chuongchun, Jonathan chung- ah Saula lung chu a sen ta thut el a, “Nang nuhmei lepchie le kâwmaw naupa, Jesai naupa chu i muolphona dingin le i nu saruokna sukmuol- phona dingin i thlang ti ka hriet naw am a nih?"
31,"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.","Jesai naupa hi, hi hnuoia a um sûng phawt chun sukdet ni naw ti nih a, i ram khawm. Chuleiin, inkotir nghâl la, ka kuomah hung inṭhuoitir rawh, a thi ngei ding a nih,” a ta."
32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?","Chun, Jonathan chun a pa Saula chu a dawn a, a kuomah, “Ieng- dingin am sukhlum ding nîng a ta? Ieng am a thaw hrim leh?” a ta."
33,And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death.,Saula chun khaw tumin a fei chu a hang inlet a; chu chu lei chun Jonathan chun a pain David chu that a lo tum ngei a ni ti a hriet tah a.
34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.","Chun, Jonathan chu dawkâna inthawk chun lunginsentakin a tho a, chu thla ni hni ni chun thlaithlêng a awt ve ta nawh a, a pa chun David a sukmuolpho êm lei chun a lung- ngaipui a nih."
35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.","Chun, zîngkâr chun Jonathan chu naupangte chu ṭhuoiin David le an hmun ruot phûl tieng chun a fe tah a."
36,"And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.","Chun, a naupang kuoma chun, “Tlân la, ka thal kâphai hi va zawng raw khai,” a ta. Chun, naupang chu a tlân lai chun a khêl tieng chun thal chu a kâp a."
37,"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?","Chun, naupang chun Jonathan thal kâp tlâkna hmun a va tlung chun Jonathan chun naupang chu a ko a, “Thal chu i khêl tienga saw a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.","Chun, Jonathan chun nau- pangte chu a ko a, “Hung tlân vak rawh, inhmaw rawh, muong naw rawh,” a ta. Chun, Jonathan nau- pang chun thal chu a rût khâwm a, a pu kuom tienga chun a fe tah a."
39,But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.,"Nisienlakhawm, naupang chun iengkhawm a hriet naw a, Jonathan le David chau chun thil umzie chu an hriet a."
40,"And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.","Chun, Jonathan chun a hriem- hreihai chu naupang chu a pêk a, a kuomah, “Fe la, khuoah lo hang fepui rawh,” a ta."
41,"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.","Chun, naupang chu a fe phingle chun David chu a umna hmun sim- tieng panga inthawk chun a hung tho a, hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai vawi thum a bûk a, chun, an infâwp a, an ṭap rêl a. David ruok chu a zuol bîk a."
42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.","Chun, Jonathan chun David kuomah, “Lungmuongtakin fe raw khai, ‘LALPA chu nang le ei inkâra le ka thlahai le i thlahai kâra chun kumkhuoin um raw se,’ tiin LALPA hmingin ṭawng ei inkhâm hmunkhat ta kha,” a ta. Chuongchun, a tho a, a fe tah a, chun, Jonathan chu khuoa chun a lût tah a."
