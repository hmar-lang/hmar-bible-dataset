1,"And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.","Chun, LALPA chun Samuel kuomah, “Israel mihai lal dinga ka dit ta naw hnung chu Saula lei hin ieng chen am i lungngai ding a ni leh? I kiah hriek thun sip la, fe rawh; Bethlehem mi Jesai kuomah ka tir ding che a nih, a naupasalhai laia mi lal dingin ka ruot zing tah a nih,” a ta."
2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.","Chun, Samuel chun, “Iengtin am fe thei ka ti leh? Saula chun a lo hriet chun mi sukhlum el a tih,” a ta. Chun, LALPA chun, “Bâwngla ṭhuoi la, ‘LALPA kuoma inthâwi dinga hung ka nih,’ ti el rawh."
3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.","Chun, inthâwinaa chun Jesai chu ko la; chun, i thaw ding chu hril ka ti cheh a; chun, a hming ka hril ding che chu hriek mi nâlpêk rawh,” a ta."
4,"And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?","Chuongchun, Samuel chun LALPA hril ang chun a thaw a, Bethlehema chun a fe tah a. Khuoa upahai chun inthin pumin ama an lo tuok a, “Thu ṭhaa hung am i nih?” an lo tih a."
5,"And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto Jehovah: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.","Ama chun, “Thu ṭhaa hung nih e, LALPA kuoma inthâwi dinga hung ka nih; insukthieng unla, inthâwinaah hung ve ro,” a ta. Chun, Jesai le a naupasalhai chu a sukthieng a, inthâwinaa chun a ko ve a."
6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah’s anointed is before him.","Chun, an hung chun, Eliab chu a lo en a, “LALPA hrieknâl chu a hmaa um hi a ni ngei el,” a ta."
7,"But Jehovah said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for Jehovah seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun Samuel kuoma chun, “A hmêl tieng amanih, ân sang tieng amanih en naw rawh, ama hi chu ka dit naw a nih, LALPA chun mihriem en dân angin a en ve si nawh a, mihriem chun puotienga inlang dân an en hlak a, LALPA ruok chun lungril tieng a en lem hlak a nih,” a ta."
8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.","Chun, Jesai chun Abinadab a hei ko a, Samuel hmaa chun ân fetir a. Ama chun, “Hi khawm hi LALPA thlang a la ni nawh,” a ta."
9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.","Chun, Jesai chun, Samma a vân fetir nâwk a. Ama chun, “Hi khawm hi LALPA thlang a la ni naw ta rawp,” a ta."
10,"And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these.","Chuongchun, Jesai chun a nau- pasal pasari hai chu Samuel hmaa chun ân fetir a. Chun, Samuel chun Jesai kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng- hai khawm hi a thlang nawh,” a ta."
11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.","Chun, Samuel chun Jesai kuomah, “Hitaka hin i nauhai an um kim vawng am?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “A naupang tak a la um a, ngai ta, berâm a vêng a nih,” a ta. Chun, Samuel chun Jesai kuomah, “Vân kotir raw khai, a hung tlung hmakhat chun ei awt naw ding a nih,” a ta."
12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.","Chuongchun, a vân kotir a, a hung ṭhuoi a. Ama chu sâr veng vawng, mit meng mawitak, en dâwl- tak el hi a na. Chun, LALPA chun, “Tho la, hriek nâl rawh, hi ngei hi a nih,” a ta."
13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.","Chuongchun, Samuel chun hriek bâwm ki chu a lâk a, a unauhai lai chun ama chu hriek a nâl a, chun, LALPA thlarau chu nasatakin chu nia inthawk chun David chunga chun a hung tlung tah a. Chuongchun, Samuel chu a tho a, Rama khuoah a fe tah a."
14,"Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.","LALPA thlarau chun Saula chu a suoksan a, LALPA tir khawhriin ama chu a sukbuoi a."
15,"And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.","Chun, Saula siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Pathien tir khaw- hriin a sukbuoi che a nih."
16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.","Tûn kan lalpa hin i siehlaw i hmaa umhai hi ṭingṭang kei thiemtak zawng ding thu mi pe raw khai, chuongchun, Pathien tir khawhriin a man pha che khawm, kei a ta, ṭha el hlak i tih,” an ta."
17,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.","Chun, Saula chun a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “Kei thiemtak chu mi zawngpêk unla, ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro le,” a tih a."
18,"Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him.","Chuongchun, tlangvâl pakhat chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Bethlehem mi Jesai naupa pakhat chu ka hmu tah a, ama chu kei thiem- tak, mi huoitak, indo mi, thuhril thiemtak, hmêl ṭhatak a nih; a kuomah LALPA khawm a um a nih,” a ta."
19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.","Chuongchun, Saula chun Jesai kuoma chun mi a tir a, “I naupa David berâm vênga um chu ka kuomah inhungtir rawh,” a ta."
20,"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.","Chun, Jesai chun sabengtung, bei le uoin peng khat phur le, kêlte a lâk a, a naupa David chu Saula pêk dingin ân chawitir a."
21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.","Chun, David chun Saula kuom chu a va tlung a, a hmaa chun a va ngîr a, ama chun a lo ngaina êm êm el a; a râlthuom chawituah a ṭhang tah a."
22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.","Chun, Saula chun Jesai kuom- ah, “David hi ka kuomah um raw se, ka mit a tlung hle el,” tia hril dingin mi a tir a."
23,"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.","Chun, hieng hi a hung na, Pathien tir khawhriin Saula chu a man po leh, David chun ṭingṭang a lâk a, a kei hlak a; chuongchun, Saula chu a hung har a, a ṭha nâwk hlak a; chun, khawhri chun a suoksan hlak a."
