Anleh, tuhin ieng ang charin am in hmuh a? In mithmua chun iengkhawm ni lo ang a ni naw am a nih?"
4,"Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts,","Anachu, Aw Zerubbabel, tuhin insukhrât rawh,’ LALPA chun a ti a nih; LALPA chun, ‘Aw Josua, nang Jehozadak naupa thiempu lal, in- sukhrât la, a rama mi po pohai, insukhrât unla, sin chu thaw ro,’ a tih, nangni lai ka um si a, mipuihai LALPA chun a tih:"

12,"If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.","‘Miin a silfên puonhmawrin sa inthieng a pai a, chu puonhmawr chun bei amanih, thil suonghruoi amanih, uoin amanih, hriek amanih, sa amani khawm a tâwk chun in- thieng a hung ni ding am a nih?’ ti hi,” tiin. Chuongchun, thiempuhai chun an dawn a, “Ni lo e,” an ta."
13,"Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.","Chun, Haggai chun, “Mi sa thi ruong leia inthieng naw chun hieng thil a iengkhawm hi tâwk sienla, thieng naw a ni ding am a ni”? a ta. Thiempuhai chun, “Thieng naw a ni ngei ding a nih,” tiin an dawn a."
14,"Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.","Chun, Haggai chun a dawn a, “Hi mipui hi chuong ang chie chu an na, hi hnam hi ka hmaa chun chuong ang chie chu an nih,” sipaihai LALPA chun a tih; “An kut sinthaw tinrêng khawm chuong ang chu a na, an thil- inhlâna chun thieng lo a um a nih."

16,"Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty vessels, there were but twenty.","khânglai sûng hrim hrim khan, miin tekhâwng sâwmhni vûma a ruota chun sâwm chau a lo na: miin sâwrna khura bûr sâwmnga thâl dinga a hung chun sâwmhni chau a lo na."
17,"I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah.","In kut sinthawnahai po poa chun riel le kumthu le ṭêk tlain ka hrem cheu a, anachu ka kuom tieng in la hung ngha naw rawp el hi,” LALPA chun a tih."

22,"and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.","ramhai lalṭhungpha khawm chu pei thlâng ka tih; chun, hnamhai lalram hrâtna chu sukse bawk ka tih; chun, tawlailîrhai chu pei thlâng ka ta, a chunga chuongtuhai le chun; sakawrhai le a chunga chuong, mi tin chu mâni unau kâwlhnâm ngeia suktlâwm ni tâng a tih,’ tiin."
23,"In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith Jehovah, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts.","‘Chu nia chun, Aw Zerubbabel ka siehlaw, Sealtiel naupa, chel ka ti che,’ sipaihai LALPA chun a tih; ‘nang hi inchikna namna angin siem ka ti che,’ LALPA chun a tih; ‘nang hi ka lo thlang ta si cheh a,’ sipaihai LALPA chun a tih” tiin."
