2,"Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, It is not the time for us to come, the time for Jehovah’s house to be built.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: “Hi chihai hin, ‘Eini ta dingin fe hun a ni nawh a, LALPA ta dinga in bâwl hun a la ni nawh’ an tih a,” tiin."

9,"Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, while ye run every man to his own house.","“Tamtak chu in zawng hlak a, anachu, tlâwmte a hung ni el hlak; ina in hung lâk lût pha khawmin, ka lo mût hmang el hlak.

11,"And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.","Hnuoi chunga dâm, tlânghai chunga dâm, buvui chunga dâm, uoin chunga dâm, hriek chunga dâm, leihnuoiin a hung insuotir taphawt le, mihriemhai chunga le, bâwng ruol chunga le, kut sininrim ra suok po po chunga chun khuo ka sukṭhâl a nih”, tiin."

14,"And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work on the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Juda ram awptu, Sealtiel naupa Zerub- babel lungril le, Jehozadak naupa Josua, thiempu lal lungril le, mipui a la um sunhai lungril chu a chawkhar tah a.
