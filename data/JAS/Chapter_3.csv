verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Be not many of you teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.","Ka unauhai, nangni laia mi tamtak hi inchûktirtuahai hung um naw ro, inchûktirtu chun rorêlna nasa lem kan tuok ding a nih ti kan hriet sih a."
2,"For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.","Thil tamtaka chun ei rêngin ei suol hlak sih a. Tûkhawm thuhril kawnga a suol naw chun, ama chu puitling a nih, a taksa pum khawm vêng thei mi a nih."
3,"Now if we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.","Ngai ta u, ei thu an awi theina dinga sakawr bauahai thîrbar ei inba chun an taksa pum khawm ei kei her hlak."
4,"Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.","Ngai ta u, lawnghai khawm hi a lien hleh a, thli natak imût lêngin a um hlak a, nisienlakhawm, a suk- hertu chun ân fetir nuomna tieng phawtah sukherna chîterekin a sukher hlak."
5,"So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!","Chuong ang bawkin, lei khawm hi taksa pêng chîterek a na, nasa- takin a uong hlak. Ngai ta u! mei chîterekin ram a va kâng nasa de!"
6,"And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.","Chun, lei hi mei a nih; ei taksa pênghai laia rîtlona hlawm chu lei hi a nih; chu chun taksa chu a pumin a sukthieng naw a, piengpui tawlailîr chu a sukkâng a, ama chu hremhmun sukkâng a nih."
7,"For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:","Sa chi tinrêng dâm, vate chi tinrêng dâm, thilhring chi tinrêng dâm, tuisuorieta thil tinrêng dâm hi vai ngam thei a ni sih a, mihriemhai ivai ngamin an um bawk a;"
8,"but the tongue can no man tame; it is a restless evil, it is full of deadly poison.","amiruokchu, lei hi tûkhawmin an vai ngam thei naw a nih; thina tûra sip, suol um ṭawk ṭawk thei naw a nih."
9,"Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:","Chu chun Lalpa le Pa ei inpâk hlak a, chu bawk chun Pathien anga siem mihriemhai chu ṭawngsie ei inphur bawk hlak a nih."
10,"out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.","Bau hmunkhata inthawkin in- pâkna le ṭawngse inphurna a suok hlak. Ka unauhai, chuong thil chu chuong ang chu a ni ding a ni nawh."
11,Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?,Tuikhur hin hnâr hmunkhatah tui inhnik le tui inhnik naw a suksuok hlak am a nih?
12,"can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither can salt water yield sweet.","Ka unauhai, theichang kûngah oliv thei a ra thei am a nih? annawleh, grêp hruiah theichang a ra thei am a nih? Chuong ang bawkin chi khur hin tui al naw a suksuok thei bawk nawh."
13,Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.,"Nangni lai tû am vara, thu hre thei a um a? Thuhnuoirawltak le vartakin a thilthawhai a um dân ṭhain inentir raw se."
14,"But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.","Nisienlakhawm, in lungrilah îtthîkna khatak le mâni hmasielna in nei chun, thudik chu uong khum le kalin khêl hril naw ro."
15,"This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.","Chu varna chu chung tienga inthawka hung thla chu a ni nawh a, khawvêl le taksa châkna le khawhria inthawk a ni lem."
16,"For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.",îtthîkna le mâni hmasielna umnaa chun buoina le thilsuksuolna tinrêng a um hlak.
17,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.","Chung tienga inthawka varna hung thla ruok chu a tîrin ân thieng phawt a; chu hnunga chun inrem a nuom a, a nun ân nêm a, a biek ân hawi a, lunginsietna le ra ṭhain a sip a, thlier bîk a nei nawh a, a vervêk naw a nih."
18,And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.,Felna ra chu inremna siem- tuhai ta ding chun inremnain tu a nih.
