1,"My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.","Ka unauhai, ei Lalpa Isu Krista, Ropuina Lalpa, ring si chun mi thlier bîk nei naw ro."
2,"For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;","In inkhâwmna inah mi râng- kachak kutsebi bun, puon mawitak sil hung lût sienla, chun, pasie puon setak sil hung lût bawk sienla,"
3,"and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;","puon mawitak sil chu in ngaisak a, a kuoma chun, “Nang hi hmun ṭhaa hin ṭhung rawh,” in tih a; chun, pasie kuoma chun, “Nang chu sawtaka sawn ngîr la, annawleh ka ke sirsan hrûla hin ṭhung rawh,” in ti chun,"
4,"do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?",in lungrilin thlier bîk neia ngai- tuona suol puta sawisêltu chu in ni naw ding am a nih?
5,"Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?","Ka unau dittakhai, ngai ta u, Pathienin hi khawvêl thila pasiehai hi, ringnaa hausa ding le, ama hmangaituhai kuoma a tiem ram chu hluotu dingahai a ruot naw am a nih?"
6,"But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?","Nangni ruok chun pasie chu in sukmuolpho ta lem a nih. Mi hau- sahai chu a suknawmnatu cheu le, rorêlna ina kei lût hlaktu cheu chu an ni naw am a nih?"
7,Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?,Hming inzaumtak in put hi hrilsetuhai an ni naw am a nih?
8,"Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien Lekha thu, “Nang în hmangai angin i vêng- hai i hmangai ding a nih,” ti lal dân hi in zâwm chun, in thaw ṭha;"
9,"but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.","amiruokchu, mi thlier bîk in nei chun, in suksuol a nih, Dânin bâw- setuah ân changtir si cheu a."
10,"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.","Tûkhawmin Dân zâwm kim sienla khawm, kawng khatah a suk- suol si chun, a rênga chun thiemnaw changin a um tah a nih."
11,"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.","“Uire naw,” titu chun, “Tuol that naw,” a ti bawk sih a. Chuongchun, uire naw la khawm tuol i that si chun, Dân bawsetu i ni hrim hrim ta a nih."
12,"So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.","Chuleiin, zalênna dâna mi ro rêl pêka um dinghai angin thu hril unla, thil thaw bawk ro."
13,For judgment is without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.,"Mi chunga lunginsietna nei naw chu, lunginsietna ṭhang loa rorêl pêkin um a tih, lunginsietna chu rorêlna chunga chun ân suong hlak a nih."
14,"What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?","Ka unauhai, miin, “Ringna ka nei,” ti sienla, thilthaw a ṭhang si naw chun ieng am ṭhahnem a ta? chuong ang ringna chun ama a sandam thei ding am a nih?"
15,"If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,","Unaupa amanih, unaunu ama- nih, saruoka umin, an ni tin bu tlasam sienla;"
16,"and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?","chun, nangni laia tûin amanih an kuomah, “Thlamuongtakin fe unla, lumtak le khawptakin um ro,” ti unla, taksa ta dinga thil ṭûl chu in pêk si naw chun ieng am ṭhahnem a ta?"
17,"Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.","Chuong ang bawkin ringna chu, thilthaw nei loa ama chaua a um chun thi a nih."
18,"Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from thy works, and I by my works will show thee my faith.","Anih, mi tûin amanih, “Nangin ringna i nei a, keiin thilthaw ka nei a nih; i ringna chu thilthaw ṭhang loin mîn entir rawh, chun, keiin ka thilthawin ka ringna inentir ka ti che."
19,"Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.","Pathien chu pakhat a ni ti i ring a ni maw? I ti ṭha, khawhrihai khawmin an ring a, an inthin hlak a nih,” tîng a tih."
20,"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?","Aw, mi teplopa, thilthaw ṭhang loa ringna ngawt chu iengkhawm a ni nawh ti i hriet nuom am?"
21,"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?",Ei thlatu Abraham chun a naupa Isak mâichâm chunga ân hlân lai khan thilthaw leiin thiem a chang a ni naw am a nih?
22,"Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;","Ringna chun a thilthaw leh a thaw hmunkhat a, chun, thilthaw leiin a ringna chu a famkim tah ti i hriet."
23,"and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.","Pathien Lekha Thu, “Abraham chun Pathien a ring a, chu ringna chu a felnaa ruot a nih,” ti thu kha a hung hlawtling a, chuongchun, Pathien Ruola inbûkin a um tah a."
24,"Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.","Ringna lei ngawt ni loin, thilthaw lei lemin, miin thiem a chang hlak ti in hriet tah."
25,"And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?","Chuong ang bawkin, Rahab nawchizawr khawm khan tirkohai kha a lo lâwm a, lampui danga ân fetir lai khan, thilthaw leiin thiem a chang a ni naw am a nih?"
26,"For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.","Thlarau ṭhang naw chun taksa chu thi a nih, chuong ang bawkin thilthaw ṭhang naw chun ringna khawm chu a thi a nih."
