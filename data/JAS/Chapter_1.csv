1,"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.","Jakob, Pathien le Isu Krista suokin, Hnam sâwm le pahni indarhai chu chibai a bûk."
2,"Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;","Ka unauhai, thlêmna tinrêng in tuok hnungin lâwmna ruokah ngai ro,"
3,knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience.,in ringna fiena chun selna a siem ti hrein.
4,"And let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.","Chun, iengkhawm tlasam loa in famkima, in puma in him theina ding- in, selna chun thaw famkim raw se."
5,"But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.","Nangni laia tûkhawmin varna a tlasam chun, mi po po kuoma hal lo le inro loa pe hlaktu Pathien chu hni raw se; chuongchun, a kuomah pêk nîng a tih."
6,"But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.","Nisienlakhawm, ringhla hlek loin, ringna neiin hni raw se, ring- hlatu chu tuisuoriet fâwn thli imût lêng le vawr ang a ni sih a."
7,For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;,"Chuong ang mi chun Lalpa kuomah iengkhawm hmu inring naw raw se,"
8,"a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.","mi lungril bulbâl nei naw, a thil thaw po poa det naw mi chun."
9,But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:,Unau daikilkâra mi chu chawi- mawia a um leiin lâwm raw se.
10,"and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.",Hausa ruok chu suktlâwma a um leiin lâwm lem raw se; hlohna pâr angin a la bo el ding a ni sih a.
11,"For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.","Nisa a hung suok a, thli lumtak a hung hrângin, hlo chu a sukvuoi a; chun a pâr chu a rêm a, a um dân mawizie chu a bohmang hlak; chuong ang bawkin mi hausa chu a fenaa chun a la vuoi ding a ni sih a."
12,"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.","Thlêmna tuor hrâm hrâmtu chu a hamṭha, fiea a um phâleh hringna lallukhum Lalpain ama hmangai- tuhai kuoma a tiem chu a hmu ding a ni si."
13,"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man:","Tûkhawmin thlêmna an tuok laiin, “Pathien ithlêm ka nih,” ti naw raw hai se; Pathien chu suol ithlêm ruol a ni nawh, ama khawmin tûkhawm a thlêm ngai nawh."
14,"but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.","Mi tin mâni châknaa ṭhuoi hmang le hîpa an um chun, thlêmna an tuok lem a nih."
15,"Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.","Chun, châkna chun tê a vawn a, suol a nei hlak; chun, suol chun a hung puitlingin thina a hung suksuok hlak."
16,"Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.","Ka unau dittakhai, hlêmin um naw ro."
17,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.","Thilpêk ṭha le thilpêk famkim po po chu chung tienga inthawkin, varhai Pa kuoma inthawkin a hung ṭum hlak a nih, amaa chun dang- lamna le inherna hlim hrim hrim a um thei nawh."
18,"Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.",A thilsiemhai hma ṭhuoitu ang ei lo ni theina dingin ama dit zâwngin thutaka inthawkin a mi nei a nih.
19,"Ye know this, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:","Unau dittakhai, chuong chu in hriet; nisienlakhawm, mi tinin ngai inchu sienla, thu hril inchu loin, lungril sukuoi raw se;"
20,for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.,mihriem lunginsenna chun Pathien felna chu a siem si nawh.
21,"Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.","Chuleiin, inthieng nawna po po le suol sip liem chu sie hmang unla, thu tu, in thlarau sandam thei chu thuhnuoirawl takin pawm ro."
22,"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.","Nisienlakhawm, mâni inhlêm a, thu ngaituhai chau ni loin, thu zâwmtuhai lo ni lem ro."
23,"For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:","Tûkhawm thu ngaitu nia, zâwmtu ni si lo chu, mi hlimenah a hmai pienpui nguntaka inen ang chu a nih."
24,"for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.","Nguntakin ân en a, a fe hmang a, mi ieng ang am a ni a theinghil nâwk si hlak a."
25,"But he that looketh into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and so continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.","Amiruokchu, tûkhawm dân famkim, zalênna dân hi bia, chuong anga um zinga, ngaia theinghil nâwk el hlaktu ni loa, zâwma sin thaw rawptu ni lem chu, ama chu a thil thawah malsâwmin um a tih."
26,"If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this man’s religion is vain.","Tûkhawm sakhaw ngaisak nia inringa, a lei vêng ṭha si loa, mâni lungrila inhlêm lemtu chu, chu mi sakhaw biek dân chu iengkhawm a ni nawh."
27,"Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.","Ei Pathien le Pa mithmua sakhaw biek dân inthieng le, suol ṭhang naw chu hi hi a nih, fahra le hmeithaihai an rimsik laia kan le, khawvêl inthieng nawna kai loa in- siem hi."
