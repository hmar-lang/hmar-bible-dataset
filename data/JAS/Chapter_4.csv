1,"Whence come wars and whence come fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members?","Nangni laia indona le insêlna hai hi khâwlaia inthawka hung suok am an na? In taksa pêngahai indona siem hlaktu, in nuom zâwnga in- thawkhai chun hung suok an ni naw am a nih?"
2,"Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.","In châk a, in nei si nawh a, tuol in that a, in inhnar a, in nei thei si nawh a; in insêl a, in indo a; in hni naw leiin in nei nawh a;"
3,"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.","in hnih a, in hni indik naw leiin in hmu nawh, in inhawitirna dingin hmang in tum sih a."
4,"Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.","Nangni uirenuhai, khawvêl ruol nina hi Pathien hmêlma nina a ni ti in hriet naw am a nih? Chuongchun, tûkhawm khawvêl ruol ni nuom taphawt chu Pathien hmêlmaah ân siem hlak a nih."
5,Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?,"Annawleh, “Thlarau einia ân chêngtir chun, thîk khawp hielin a mi dit a nih,” ti hi, Pathien Lekha Thuin iengkhawm ni loin a hrilin in ring am a nih?"
6,"But he giveth more grace. Wherefore the scripture saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.","Nisienlakhawm, lunginsietna tam nâwkzuol a pêk hlak; chuleiin, Pathien Lekha Thuin, “Pathienin mi chapohai a kal a, inngaitlâwmhai ruok chu lunginsietna a pêk hlak,” a ti a nih."
7,"Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.","Chuongchun, Pathien thu thuin um ro; amiruokchu, Diebol chu kal ro, chuongchun, tlân hmang san a ti cheu."
8,"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.","Pathien hnai ro, chuongchun, amain hnai a ti cheu. Mi suolhai, in kuthai sâwpfai ro, lungril bulbâl nei nawhai, in lungrilhai sukthieng ro."
9,"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.","Rimsi unla, lungngai unla, ṭap ro; in innui chu lungngaiah inchang sienla, in hlim nguiah inchang raw se."
10,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.","Lalpa mithmuin inngaitlâwm ro, chuongchun, chawimawi a ti cheu."
11,"Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.","Unauhai, inhrilse tuo naw ro. Tûkhawmin a unau a hrilsietin amanih, a unau a sawisêlin amanih, Dân a hrilsietin Dân a sawisêl a nih; nisienlakhawm, Dân i sawisêl chun Dân zâwmtu i ni nawh a, rorêltu i ni lem."
12,"One only is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor?","Dân petu le rorêltu pakhat chau a um; sandam theia, sukbohmang thei chu; nang tuolbâwmhai sawisêl- tu chu tu am i ni leh?"
13,"Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain:","Tuhin ngai ta u khai! nangni, “Vawisûn amanih, zinga manih, chu khawpuia chun fêng ei ta, chutaka chun kum khat va thang ei ta, sumdâwng ei ta, hlâwkna hmûng ei tih,” tituhai,"
14,"whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.","zînga chun ieng am a hung um ding in hriet si nawh. In hringna chu ieng am a na? Sûm sâwt nawtê hung inlanga, bo nâwk el hlak ang hi in ni sih a."
15,"For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.","Chuongchun, “Lalpain rem a ti chun dam ei ta, chu chu, kha kha thâwng ei tih,” in ti ding hi a nih."
16,But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.,"Nisienlakhawm, in uongnahai hi in suong lem sih a; chuong ang suongna po po chu suol a nih."
17,"To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.","Chuongchun, tûkhawm thil ṭha thaw ding hre sia, thaw naw chu, a ta dingin suol a nih."
