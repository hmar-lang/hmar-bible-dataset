1,"How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! She is become as a widow, that was great among the nations! She that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!","Iengtiziea khawpui khânga mi- puia sip kha khawsâwta ṭhung el am an tah a! Hnamhai laia khânga ropui kha, iem a tih a hmeithai ang a hung ni ta el chu! Rambunghai laia a lalnu ni hlak kha, chîn lem a hung ni ta el chu!"
2,"She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.","Zâna chun a ṭap ngâwi ngâwi a, a mitthli chu a bienga chun a luong a, A hmangaituhai po po lai tukhawm ama thlamuongtu ding a nei nawh; A ruolhai po po chun khaw- hlotakin ama an sawisak a; A hmêlmahai an hung ni vawng el tah ie."
3,"Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.","Sukrinumna le sal nina nasatak- ah Juda chu salin a fe tah a, Awi naw mihai laia chun a khawsa a, châwl hrim a hmu nawh; Ama sukrimsituhai po po chun hmun inchêptakah an nangchîng a."
4,"The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.","Inkhâwmpui hunbi neia chun tukhawm an hung naw leiin Zion lampui chun a sûn a, A dai kawtkhârhai po po chu râusanin a um a, a thiempuhai chu an inrûm a; A nunghâkhai chu sukrinumin an um a, ama khawm chu khâknaa chun a um a."
5,"Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.","A khingtuhai chu lu an hung na, a hmêlmahai chu an hung hlawtling a; A bawsietna tamtak el lei chun LALPAIN ama chu a sukrimsi sih a, A nau le têhai chu a hmêl- mahai hmaa chun salah an feh a."
6,"And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.","Zion nâunua inthawk chun a lal nina po po a fe hmang a, A lalhai khawm sakhi hlo petna ding hmu lohai ang an ni zo a; Anni hnawttuhai hmaa chun hrâtna neiloin an tlân a."
7,"Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.","Jerusalem chun sukrinuma a um nihaia le, a rimsik nihaia chun, a hriet zing, A tienlai inhawitirna po po kha; A mipuihai chu hmêlma kuta an tlûk lai chun an ṭhangpui nawh a, Hmêlmahai chun an hmuh a, râusana a umnaa chun an nuisan a."
8,"Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing; All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.","Jerusalem chu lungngaithlâk- tak elin a lo suol tah a; chuleiin, thil thieng naw ang a hung ni tah a; A saruokna chu an hmu leiin, ama lo inza hlaktuhai po po khawm khan an hmusit tah a; Anih, ân rûm a, nawtieng a nghah a."
9,"Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.","A tirdakumna chu a puonah a kai a, a tâwpna ding hrim a ngaituo nawh, Chuleiin, maktakelin a tlâwm a, thlamuongtu hrim a hmu nawh; En ta, aw LALPA, ka rimsikzie hi, ka hmêlma chu ama le ama ân chawimawi sih a!"
10,"The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly.","Hmêlma chun a thil hlu hai po po chungah a kut a phar a, Awinaw mi chu a hmun inthiengtaka chun a lût ti a hmu sih a, I mipui inkhâwmnaa lût lo dinga i khaphai ngei kha."
11,"All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.","A mihai po po chu an thuok dawngin bei an zawng a, An thil hluhai chu an hringna sukhrâtna dingin bu manah an pêk a; Aw LALPA, ngai la, en ta, hmusitum ka lo ni ta hi."
12,"Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is brought upon me, Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.","Nangni a fe inlawn po pohai, in ta dingin iengkhawm a ni naw maw? Ngai unla, ka kuoma thaw anga, ka lungngaina ang hrim hi lungngaina a um am en ta u, LALPAIN a lunginsenna ṭium nia a mi sukrinumna ang hi."
13,"From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.","Chungtienga inthawkin ka ru sûngah mei a hung tir a, anni chu a hne tah a, Ka kehai ta dingin lên a phah a, a mi keikîr tah a; Râusanah a mi siem a, chauin ka um ni tin a."
14,"The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail: The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.","Ka bawsietnahai chu rîngkawlah a khitdeh a, Ama kuthai ngeiin a khit têl a; Ka rîngah ân bâttir a, ka hrâtna a châu tah a, Ka ido zo lohai kutah LALPA chun a mi pêk tah a."
15,The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me; He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.,"Keimaa ka mi hrâthai po po chu LALPA chun iengkhawm loah a siem a, Ka tlangvâlhai sukse dingin ka chungah pungkhâwmhai a ko a; Juda nau nunghâk inthieng chu LALPA chun uoin sâwrnaa angin a chîl a."
16,"For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water; Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.","Hieng thilhai lei hin ka ṭap a; ka mit chu tuiin a luong- thla a, Thlamuongtu ka lungril sukhartu ding kha keimaa inthawka a hlat êm leiin. Hmêlmahai chun an hne ta leiin, ka nauhai chu râusanin an um tah a."
17,"Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.","Zion chun a bânhai a phar vêl a, ama thlamuongtu ding tukhawm an um nawh, LALPA chun Jakob chungthua chun, ama vêl hnaia umhai po chu a hmêlmahai nîng an tih tiin thu a lo pêk tah a; Jerusalem chu anni laia chun thil thiengnaw ang a lo ni tah."
18,"Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.","LALPA chu a fel a nih; a thupêk dodâlin ka hel sih a; Ngai ta u, ka ngên cheu, nangni hnam po pohai, ka lungngaina hi en ta u, Ka nunghâkhai le ka tlangvâl- hai chu salah an fe tah a."
19,"I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought them food to refresh their souls.","Ka hmangaituhai chu ka hei ko a, nisienlakhawm, an mi hlêm a, Ka thiempuhai le ka upahai chu khawpuia chun an bohmang tah a, An hringnahai sukhrât dinga bu an zawng lai chun."
20,"Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled; My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.","Ngai ta, aw LALPA, rimsiin ka um hi; ka phîng chu a buoi a; Ka lung chu ka sûnga chun ân her a, khawhlotakin ka lo hel ta sih a; Kawtthlêra chun kâwlhnâm chun a sukfahrah a, ina chun thina a um a."
21,"They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me.","Ka thuok dawngna chu an hriet a, a mi thlamuong ding tukhawm an um nawh; Ka hmêlmahai po po chun ka buoina chu an lo hriet a, nangin i thaw a ni leiin an lâwm a; Ni i phuong ta chu la hung intlungtir i ta, anni khawm keia ang bawk nîng an tih."
22,"Let all their wickedness come before thee; And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.","An khawhlonahai po po chu i hmaa chun hung tlung sienla, Ka bawsietnahai po po leia ka chunga i thaw ang khan an chunga khawm thaw ve rawh. Ka thuokdawngnahai chu tamtak an na, ka lungril khawm a chau a nih."
