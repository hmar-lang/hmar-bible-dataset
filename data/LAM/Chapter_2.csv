1,"How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.",Zion naunu chu LALPA chun a lunginsena iengtizie a sûmpuia ân khum am a na! Israel mawina chu vâna inthawkin hnuoiah a hung pei thlâk a; A lunginsen nia chun a ke innghatna khawm chu a hriet zing ta nawh.
2,"The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.","LALPA chun Jakob ram hluohai po po chu a lem zo vawng a, a lunginsiet nawh, Juda naunu kul dethai chu a lunginsen chun a keichim a; Hnuoiah a hung tethlûk a; Lalram le lalhai khawm chu a suktlâwm tah a."
3,"He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.","Lunginsenna ṭiumtakin Israel ki po po chu a sât thlâk a; Hmêlma hmaa inthawkin a kut changtieng chu a keitîm a; Meichawk angin Jakob chu, arêng arama kâng hmangin a raw tah a."
4,"He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary, And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire.","Hmêlma angin a thalngul chu a kuoi a, hmêlma angin a kut changtiengin a ngîr a, Zion naunu puon ina mita hmu inhâwkumhai po po chu a that vawng a; A lunginsenna chu mei angin a bunthlâk a,"
5,"The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strongholds; And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.","LALPA chu hmêlma ang a hung ni tah a, Israel a lem zo a; A in ropuihai po po a lem zo a, a kul dethai a sukchim a, Juda naunua chun sûnna le lusûnna a sukpung bawk a."
6,"And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly: Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.","A biekbûk chu huon ang elin, a lâk hmang luipêk a; Ân khâwmna hmun chu a suksiet bawk a; LALPA chun Zionah, inkhâwmpui hunbi neihai le châwlnihai chu theinghila um dingin a siem a, A lunginsenna nasatna chun a thiempu le lal chu a hmusit tah a."
7,"The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary; He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn assembly.","LALPA chun a mâichâm chu a peihâwnpêk a, a hmun inthieng khawm chu a sukthim a; A in ropui kulhai chu hmêlma kuta chun a pêkpêk bawk a. Inkhâwmpui hunbi nei nihai ang elin, LALPA ina chun an khêkri chêl chûl a,"
8,"Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying; And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.","LALPA chun Zion naunu kul chu suksiet a tum tah a; Rînin ân khi vawng tah a, suksietnaa inthawk chun a kut keitîm ta naw ni; Kul le a daihai chu ân sûntir a, an ngui hmunkhat ve ve a."
9,"Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah.","A dâi kawtkhârhai chu hnuoiah an tlumhmang a; a kalna thîrhai chu a suktliekin a suksiet tah a; A lal le hotuhai chu dân um nawnaa hnamhai laia chun an um a; Anih, a zâwlneihai khawma LALPAA inthawka thilhmulâwk an hmu ta nawh."
10,"The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence; They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.","Zion naunu upahai chu hnuoi chungah an ṭhung a, an to ṭawk ṭawk a; An luhai chunga chun pilvut an vânvawr a; saiip puonin an inthuom a; Jerusalem nunghâkhai khawm hnuoi tieng an luhai an kûn el a nih."
11,"Mine eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled; My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.","Ka mithai chun mitthli a tlasam hiel a, ka sûng tieng a buoi zo a, Ka mîtkhâ chu hnuoi chungah bunthlâkin a um a, ka mihai naunuhai suksietna lei chun; Naupang dâwnghai le nêne ne laihai chu kawtthlêrhaia chun an inkawn el a."
12,"They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, When their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.","An nuhai kuoma chun, “Bu le uoin khâwlai am a um a?” an tih a, Khawpui kawtthlêrhaia hliem anga an inkawn el lai le, An thlahai chu an nuhai ângsûnga an hringna a ṭuoi ral lai chu."
13,"What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?","Ieng am inhriettir ka cheh a, ieng lêm hrilkhîng ka ti cheh a, Aw Jerusalem naunu? Nang chu ka thlamuon theina ding chein, ieng tluk chau am ka ni ding a na, Aw Zion naunu nunghâk? I sietna chu tuisuoriet angin a lien a, tuin am sukdam thei a ti cheh a?"
14,"Thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions; And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity, But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.","I zâwlneihai hlakin invêtna le teplo mei mei thilhmulâwkhai chu an hmupêk cheh a; I sal nina hung lakîr dingin, i suolna hlak an hmusuok thei si nawh a. Nanga ta dingin hlêmna le, teplo thu mei mei chau chu an hmupêk cheh a."
15,"All that pass by clap their hands at thee; They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?","Mi fe inlawnhai po po chun an kuthai an ben khum cheh a, Jerusalem naunu chunga hin an sisi a, an luhai an thin a, “Hi hi a ni maw mihaiin, Mawina famkimna, Leihnuoi po poa khawpui an ti chu?,” tiin."
16,"All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee; They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up; Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.","I hmêlmahai po po hlaka an bauhai an kâk khum pêkpûk cheh a; An sisi a, an ha an rawt a, “Ama chu ei lem zo tah, Ah, hi ni hi annâwm ei thlîr zing kha, ei hmusuok tah a, ei hmu ta hi,” an tih a."
17,"Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.","LALPA chun thaw a itum chu a thaw tah a; Tienlai nihaia thu a pêk thuhai chu a hung sukpuitling tah a; A pei thlâk tah a, a lunginsiet nawh a; Hmêlmahai chu lâwmin a siem tah a; I hmêlmahai ki chu a chawimawi ta a ni hi."
18,"Their heart cried unto the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; Give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.","An lungril chu LALPA kuomah a khêk a; Aw Zion naunu kul, sûn le zânin mitthli chu vadung angin inluongthlâktir rawh; Sâwldamna chu nang le nang inpe naw la; i mitthli luong chu ma naw raw se."
19,"Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.","Tho la, vêng ṭantirna huna chun, zânah khêk rawh; LALPA hmaihmaa chun i lung- ril chu tui angin bunthla la, I nau le têhai hringna dingin ama tienga chun i kuthai phar rawh, Chuong kawtthlêr tâwp tina phîngṭâma châuhai ta ding chun."
20,"See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou hast done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?","En ta, Aw LALPA, ngai ta, hienga an kuoma i thawnahai hi! Nuhmeihai chun an rîla ra, nau- panghai, kuta tâwma umhai chu, an fâk el ding maw? LALPA hmun inthienga chun zâwlnei le thiempu chu that an ni el ding maw?"
21,"The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, and not pitied.","Mi a naupang le upa khawm chu kawtthlêra chun hnuoiah an zâl a; Ka nunghâkhai le ka tlangvâlhai chu kâwlhnâmah an tluh a; I lunginsenna nia chun anni chu i sukhlum a, Anni chu i that a, i lunginsiet nawh a,"
22,"Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side; And there was none that escaped or remained in the day of Jehovah’s anger: Those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.","Inkhâwmpui hunbi neihai nia angin, “Ka lunginsenna chu kil tinah,” tiin nang chu i khêk a, LALPA lunginsenna nia chun a pumpel amanih, a um zing amanih tukhawm an um nawh: Ka tâwm a, ka dawn tleihai chu ka hmêlma chun a sukbohmang zo tah a."
