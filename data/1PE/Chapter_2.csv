8,"and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.","“Tlûkna lung le dangna lungpui leh,” Thu chu an awi naw leiin an tlu sih a, chuong anga um dinga ruot an ni hrim bawk a."
9,"But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:","Nisienlakhawm, inthima in- thawka suok a, a var nasataka lût dinga kotu cheu ṭhatna chu in inentir theina dingin, nangni chu chi thlang, lal thiempuhai, hnam inthieng, Pathien mihai ngei in ni sih a."

12,"having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.","Jentailhai lai in chângzie chu mawitak ni raw se; chuongchun, thil suksuoltuhai anga an hrilsiet cheu kawngah in thil thaw ṭhat an hmuhai leiin a hung kan nia chun Pathien chawimawi thei an tih."
13,"Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;","Lalpa leiin mihriem ruothai taphawt kuomah intuklût ro, chung- hnunga um laltak kuoma manih,"
14,"or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.","thil suksuoltuhai chunga phuba la ding le, thil sukṭhatuhai inpâk dinga ama itir sâwng Bawrsâp kuoma khawm."
15,"For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:","Hi hi Pathien dit zawng a ni si, mi invêthai thu hril var naw chu thil ṭha thawa in sêldawng hi;"
16,"as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.","zalên in nih, nisienlakhawm, in zalênna chu suol inkhumna dinga hmang loin, Pathien suoka umna dingin hmang lem ro."
17,Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.,"Mi po po chawimawi ro. Unau- hai chu hmangai ro, Pathien ṭidêk ro. Laltak chu chawimawi ro."
18,"Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.","Siehlawhai, ṭi dêkin in hotuhai thu thuin um ro; mi ṭha le mi nuninnêmhai kâwla chau ni loin, mi nunsehai kâwla khawm."
19,"For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.","Miin Pathien hrietna leiin tuor naw ding ding tuorin lungngaina a tuor hrâm hrâm chun, chu chu Pathien lâwm zâwng a ni sih a."
20,"For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted for it, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.","In suol a, kutthlâk in tuorin, seltakin tuor unla khawm inpâk ieng am in hlaw leh? Nisienlakhawm, thil in thaw ṭhaa in tuorin, seltaka in tuor chun, chu chu Pathien lâwm zâwng a nih."
21,"For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps:",Krista khawm khan a tuorpêk cheu leiin hieng ang hi thaw dinga ko in nih in sawnnaw; a kehnunga in zuina dingin enkhi ding a mâksan pêk cheu kha.
22,"who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:","Ama chun thil hrim a suksuol nawh a, a bauah zâwrna hrim a um bawk nawh."
23,"who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:","Mi hala a um laiin a hal ve thung nawh a, a tuor laiin a vau nawh a, feltaka ngaituo hlaktu kuoma chun ân pêk lem a nih."
24,"who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.","Suol tiengahai thi tain felna tienga ei hring theina dingin, ama ngeiin a taksain thinga khan ei suolhai a phur a, ama vuokna invuol- hai chun sukdamin in um tah a."
25,For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.,"Berâm inhmang anga in in- hmang kha, tu ruok hin chu in thlarau vêngtu le, Hotu kuoma chun in kîr nâwk ta hi."
