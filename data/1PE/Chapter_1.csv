1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,","Peter, Isu Krista tirko chun: Ponto ram dâm, Galati ram dâm, Kappadokia ram dâm, Asia ram dâm, Bethunia ram dâma Indar umhai,"
2,"according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.","awi ding le Isu Krista thisen the dawng dinga Thlarau isuktum, Pa Pathien ihriet lâwk anga thlanghai kuoma chun: In chungah lunginsietna le inrem- na sukpungin um raw se."
3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pathien le Pa chu inpâkin um raw se. Ama chun, a lunginsietna nasatak angin, mithi laia inthawka Isu Krista thonâwkna leiin beiseina hring hmu dingin nauvin a mi nei nâwk a,"
4,"unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,","rochan se thei naw, inthieng nawna kai naw, chuoi thei naw, vâna in ta dinga a ikhêk chu hmu dingin."
5,who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.,"Sandamna, hun nuhnunga in- lang dinga inzosa chu hmu dingin, ringna leia Pathien thilthawtheinaa vêng chu in nih."
6,"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold trials,","Chutaka chun nasatakin in hlim a nih, tuhin, (a ṭûl chun) thlêmna tinrêng leiin lungngai hri unla khawm;"
7,"that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ:","in ringna fiena, rângkachak meia fie hnung khawma bohmang hlak nêka hlu lem chu, Isu Krista inlâr pha chun inpâkna le chawimawina le ropuina ding a hung ni theina dingin."
8,"whom not having seen ye love; on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory:","Ama chu hmu ngai naw khawmin in hmangai a, ama chu tuhin hmu naw unla khawm, in awi a, lâwm hril thei ruol lo le ropuitakin in hlim bêk bêk hlak;"
9,"receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.","in ring san, in thlarau sandamna chu hmuin."
10,"Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:","Lunginsietna, nangni ta ding ngei lo hrillâwktu zâwlneihai chun, hi sandamna hi zawngin an lo sui ngun hlak a;"
11,"searching what time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.","Krista Thlarau annia um chun, Krista tuor dinghai le chu hnunga ropuina hung um ding ân hriet- lâwktir lai khan, ieng hun âm, ieng ang takin am a hung tlung ding ti an lo sui ngun hlak a nih."
12,"To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.","Chuong thu chun mani rawng inbâwl loin, nangni rawng an bâwl lem ti an kuomah inhriettir a ni tah. Chuong thu chu vâna inthawka tirsuok Thlarau Inthieng ṭhangpuiin, Chanchin Ṭha hriltu cheu khan tuhin an hril cheu a, chuong thil chu vântirkohaiin bi an nuom hlak a nih."
13,"Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;","Chuleiin, in lungril dier keiin, ngaiven unla, Isu Krista inlâr pha chun lunginsietna a hung chawipêk ding cheu chu beidawng loin beisei tlat ro;"
14,"as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance:","nau tiawihai angin, in hriet naw laia in tienlai châknahai anga um loin;"
15,"but like as he who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living;","a kotu cheu chu ân thieng angin, nangni khawm in chângzie po poah lo inthieng lem ta ro;"
16,"because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.","“Nangni in inthieng ding a nih, kei kân thieng sih a,” ti ziek ang khan."
17,"And if ye call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:","Chun, mi tin thlier bik nei loa, sinthaw ang peia ngaituo hlaktu chu Pa anga in lam chun hitaka in châm sûng po chu ṭi dêkin um ro."
18,"knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers;","In thlatuhai ipêk sâwng, in um dân ieng ni barloa inthawk chu, thil se thei, tangka le rângkachaka intlan in ni nawh a,"
19,"but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, even the blood of Christ:","berâmte hmêlhem lo le inthieng nawna kai lo thisen anga, Krista thisen hlu chun intlan in ni lem ti in hriet sih a."
20,"who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake,","Ama chu leilung insieng hmain ruot lâwkin a um ngei el, nisien- lakhawm, hun nuhnunga hin nangni leiin suklangin a um;"
21,"who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.","ama leiin mithi laia inthawka a keithotu le a ropuina petu Pathien ringtuhai in na, in ringna le in beisei- na chu Pathiena a um theina dingin."
22,"Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently:","Unauhai hmangai taktak ding- in, thutak zâwma in thlarau in suk- thieng ta leiin lungrila ṭhahnem- ngaitakin inhmangai tuo ro."
23,"having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.","Chi se theia inthawkin ni loin, Pathien thu hring zing le um zinga chun, chi se thei nawa inthawka pieng thar in ni sih a."
24,"For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth:","“Mi po po hlohna ang an nih, An ropuina po po khawm Hlo pâr ang a nih. Hlo chu a vuoi a, A pâr chu a tla a,"
25,But the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you.,"Lalpa thu ruok chu, Chatuonin a um zing a nih,” ti a ni sih a. Chu chu a nih, Chanchin Ṭha thu an hril cheu kha."
