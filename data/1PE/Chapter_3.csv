1,"In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;","Chuong ang bawkin nangni nuhmeihai, mâni pasalhai thu thuin um ro; chuongchun, anni laia tûkhawmin thu chu awi naw sien khawm, thu ni loin, an nuhmeihai chângziea hnein um thei an tih,"
2,beholding your chaste behavior coupled with fear.,in chângze inthieng le inzaumtak an hmu pha chun.
3,"Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;","In incheina chu puotieng in- cheina sam phier dâm, rângkachak ṭhi hli dâm, silfêna inthuom dâm chu ni loin,"
4,"but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.","lungrila mihriem thupa um, lungril thuhnuoirawl le nuninnêm silfên se thei loa inthuom ni lem raw se, chu chu Pathien mithmu chun a hlu bêk bêk a nih."
5,"For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:","Chuong ang bawkin, inhmaa nuhmei inthieng Pathien ringtuhai khawm kha mâni pasalhai thu thua umin an inchei hlak sih a."
6,"as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.","Sarain Abraham chu, “Lalpa,” tiin a thu a awi ang khan, thil ṭha thawin, ṭitna ding hrim nei loa in um chun, Sara nauhai nîng in tih."
7,"Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.","Nangni pasalhai, chuong ang bawkin, nuhmei hi bêl kawi awl lem an ni lei le, lunginsietna hringna chu changpuitu an ni hre zingin, chawi- mawi pumin in nuhmeihai kuomah um ro, in ṭawngṭainahai hluoa a um nâwna dingin."
8,"Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:","A tâwp taka chun, in rêngin lung- ril hmunkhatin um unla, inlainat tuo unla, unau angin inhmangai unla, lunginsietna nei unla, thuhnuoi- rawlin um ro."
9,"not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.","Suol suolin thung naw unla, halna halna bawkin thung naw ro; malsâwm hlau lem ro. Hi hi lei hin ko in ni si, malsâwmna chang dingin."
10,"For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:","“Hringna hmangai nuom le, Ni ṭhahai hmu nuom chun, Suola inthawkin a lei vêng ṭha sienla, A hmûr khawm zâwrna thu hril naw dingin, Vêng ṭha raw se."
11,"And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.","Suol nghatsanin, Thil ṭha thaw raw se; Inremna zawngin, Hnawt pei raw se."
12,"For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.","Lalpa mit chu mi felhai chungah a fuh a, A na khawm an ṭawngṭaina tieng a sit hlak sih a, Amiruokchu, Lalpa hmêl chu, Thil suksuoltuhai chungah a um hlak,” ti a ni sih a."
13,"And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?",Thil ṭha tienga ṭhahnem in ngai chun in pawi tâwk ding tu am um an ta?
14,"But even if ye should suffer for righteousness’ sake, blessed are ye: and fear not their fear, neither be troubled;","Nisienlakhawm, felna leia lo tuor ta dâm in ni chun, hamṭhâng in tih. An ṭitumna chu ṭi naw unla, lunginzîng bawk naw ro."
15,"but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: being ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:","Amiruokchu, in lungrilah Krista chu Lalah ruot ro; nangnia um in beiseina san chu ân dawn taphawt cheu chu dawn dingin inzosa rawp ro."
16,"having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.","Nisienlakhawm, thuhnuoirawl- tak le ṭi dêk pumin, sie le ṭha hrietna inthiengtak nei unla, chuongchun, an hrilsietna cheu kawnga chun, Kristaa in um dân ṭhatak hrilsetuhai chu sukmuolphoin um thei an tih."
17,"For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.","Thil suol thaw leia tuor nêk chun, Pathien remti zâwng a ni chun thil ṭha thaw leia tuor hi a ṭha lem sih a."
18,"Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;","Pathien kuoma a mi ṭhuoi theina dingin Krista chun suolhai leiin vawikhat a tuor bawk sih a, mi fel chun mi fel naw aiin a tuor a, tisaa sukhlumin a um a, thlaraua ruok chun sukhringin a um tah."
19,"in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,","Chu chun, intângna ina thlarau umhai kuoma chun thu a zu khêk- pui a."
20,"that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:","Chuonghai chun, inhmaa Noa dam laia lawng siem sûng poa, Pathien dâwtheinain a nghâk lai khan an awi nawh a; chu lawnga chun, mi tlâwmtê (chu chu pariet tina a nih) tuia inthawka sandamin an um tah."
21,"which also after a true likeness doth now save you, even baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;","Chu angpui Baptisma chun, Isu Krista thonâwkna leiin tuhin a sandam cheu a nih. (Chu chu tisa inthieng naw sukfai el ni loin, sie le ṭha hrietna inthienga Pathien lamna hi a ni lem)."
22,"who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.","Isu Krista chu vâna fein, Pathien chang tieng a um a, vântir- kohai dâm, thuneina dâm, thilthaw- theina dâm, ama thu thua inumtirin a um."
