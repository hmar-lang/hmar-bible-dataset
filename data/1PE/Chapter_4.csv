verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;","Chuongchun, Kristain tisaa a tuor leiin nangni khawm, chuong ang lungrilin inthuom ve ro; tisaa tuor ta chun suol a bânsan ta sih a."
2,"that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.","Chuongchun, hi hnunga tisaa in la um sûng po chu mihriem châk- nahai tienga um ta loin, Pathien dit zâwng tieng um tâng in tih."
3,"For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries:","Jentailhai dit zâwng thâwna ding le, hurnaa dâm, taksa châknaa dâm, uoin hênaa dâm, zu hmun hlimnaa dâm, zu dâwn khâwmnaa dâm, milim biekna tirdakumtaka dâma umna ding chun kha hma kha a huntâwk tah."
4,"wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:","Chuonga chun anni inhawitir taluo anga in um ve ta naw hi mak an ta, an hrilsiet hlak cheu a nih."
5,who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.,"Anni chun, mi hring le mithihai ngaituo dinga inzosa kuoma chun an chanchin la hril an tih."
6,"For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.","Hi hi lei hin a nih, mithihai lai khawm chun Chanchin Ṭha hril a ni, tisaa um mihriemhai anga ngaituoin an um a, thlaraua ruok chun Pathien anga an hring theina dingin."
7,"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind, and be sober unto prayer:","Nisienlakhawm, thil po po tâwpna chu a hnai tah a, chuleiin, in ṭawngṭai theina dingin lungril feltak putin fimkhur ro."
8,above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins:,"Iengkim nêkin, ṭhahnemngai- takin inhmangai tuo lem ro; hma- ngaina chun suol tamtak ân khum hlak sih a."
9,using hospitality one to another without murmuring:,"Chier loin intlung tuo unla,"
10,"according as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;","mi tinin, Pathien lunginsietna tinrêng enkawltu ṭha angin, Pathien thilpêk an dawnghai taphawt chu hmangin rawng inbâwl tuo seng ro."
11,"if any man speaketh, speaking as it were oracles of God; if any man ministereth, ministering as of the strength which God supplieth: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.","Mi tûkhawmin thu a hril chun Pathien thuhai angin hril raw se; mi tûkhawmin rawng a bâwl chun Pathienin hrâtna a pêk ang peiin bâwl raw se; chuongchun, Isu Krista leiin Pathien chu thil iengkimah chawimawiin um thei a tih, ropuina le rorêlna chu chatuona ama ta a ni sih a. Amen."
12,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto you:","Dittakhai, nangni laia fiena nasatak hung um, nangni fiena dinga in chunga hung tlung hi, thil mak in chunga tlung angin makti naw ro."
13,"but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy.","Krista tuornahaia tuorpuituhai in ni zie ang peiin lâwm lem ro; chuongchun, a ropuina a hung inlang pha chun nangni khawm hlimtakin lâwm thei in tih."
14,"If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are ye; because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you.",Krista hming leia hal in ni chun in hamṭha; ropuina Thlarau le Pathien Thlarau chu in chungah a um sih a.
15,"For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other men’s matters:","Nisienlakhawm, nangni laia tûkhawm tuolthattu a ni leiin ama- nih, inru a ni leiin amanih, thil suksuoltu a ni leiin amanih, mi danghai thilthaw rêlpêktu a ni leiin amanih tuor naw raw se."
16,"but if a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.","Amiruokchu, kristien a ni leiin tuor sienla, inzak naw raw se; chu hming lei chun Pathien chawimawi lem raw se."
17,"For the time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God: and if it begin first at us, what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?","Rorêlna chu Pathien sûnghaia hin ṭan a hun ta sih a; chun, einia hman a phut hmasa chun Pathien Chanchin Ṭha thu zâwm nawhai tâwpna chu ieng tin tak am nîng a ta?"
18,"And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?","Chun, mi fel hman sandam hrâm hrâm a ni chun, Pathien ngai- sak naw le mi suol chu khâwlai am inlang phâk hlak an ta?"
19,Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator.,"Chuleiin, Pathien remti zâwng anga tuorhai chun, thil ṭha thawin an thlarauhai chu Siemtu ringumtak kuomah inkawltir raw hai se."
