4,"For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live;","LALPA chun Israel chihai kuoma chun hieng ang hin a ti sih a: “Mi zawng unla, hring in tih;"
5,"but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.","nisienlakhawm, Bethel khuo chu zawng naw unla, Gilgala chun lût naw bawk unla. Beer-seba khuoah kai bawk naw ro; Gilgal khuo chu matheiloin sala manin a um ding a ni sih a; Bethel khuo chu teplo hung nîng a tih.”"
6,"Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el.","LALPA chu zawng unla hring in tih, chuong naw chun, Josef inah mei angin suok a ta, kâng vawng a ta, Bethel khuoah sukrêm dingin tu- khawm um naw ni hai;"
7,"Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,","rorêlna sairam thinga inchangtir a, felna chu hnuoia pei thlahai;"
8,"seek him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name);","Siruk le Sizucho siemtu le thina deihlim zîngkâra inchangtirtu le, sûn chu zân inthima siemtu, tuisuoriet tuihai ko a, hnuoi chunga inluong- tirtu chu, ama chu zawng unla, a hming chu LALPA a nih,"
9,"that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.","kul chunga bohmangna hung tlung khawpa, mi hrâthai chunga bo- hmangna intluntu chu."
10,"They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.","Kawtkhâra kâwktu chu an theidah a, thu fel hriltu chu an tirdak a."
11,"Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.","Chuleiin, mi rimsihai sirdein bu in lâkpêk a, lung intieng inhai in bâwl a, nisienlakhawm, a sûngah chêng naw ti niu; grêp huon inhawihai in siem a, nisienlakhawm, a uoin dâwn naw ti niu."
12,"For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins—ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate from their right.","In bawsietnahai tamzie le, in suolnahai a nasatzie ka hriet sih a; mi felhai suknawmna a, thamna la a, kawtkhâra tlasamhai an chantâwk nghatsantuhai."
13,Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.,"Chuongchun, mi var chu chuong ang huna chun to zing a ta, hun ṭha naw a ni leiin."
14,"Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.","In hring theina dingin ṭhat nawna zawng loin, ṭhatna zawng unla; chun, in hril angin, LALPA sipaihai Pathien chu in kuomah um a tih."
15,"Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.","Suolna chu theida unla, ṭhatna ngaina unla, kawtkhâra rorêlna chu inngîr nghet ro; Josefhai laia hlabîkhai chunga chun LALPA, sipaihai Pathien chun lunginsietna a nei el rawi mawh."
16,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.","Chuleiin, LALPA, sipaihai Pathien, Lalpa chun hieng ang hin a tih, “Khawlaidung lien po poah ṭap rak rakna um a ta, kawtthlêr po poah. ‘A va pawi de aw!’ tîng an tih; lungngai dingin loneituhai le ṭap rak rak dingin lusûn thiemhai ko an tih."
17,"And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.","Chun, grêp huon po poa chun ṭap rak rakna um a ta, nangni lai ka fethleng ding a ni sih a,” LALPAIN a tih."
18,"Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.","LALPA ni dittuhai, in chung a rik ie! Iengdinga LALPA ni chu in dit am a na? Var ni loin inthim a ni lem."
19,"As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.","Sakeibaknei mâksan a, savawm intuokpui mi ang le, ina lût a, bang chunga kut innghat a, rûlin a chuk ang chu a nih."
20,"Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?","LALPA ni chu var ni loin inthim a ni naw ding am a nih? Thim sâtak, var hrim hrim khawm nei dêr lo."
21,"I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.","In ruoiṭhehai ka theidain ka hmusit a, in inkhâwmpui ursûnahai chun lâwm bawk naw ning."
22,"Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.","Anih, in pumrawhmang thil- inhlân le in bu thilinhlânhai chu mîn hlân unla khawm, pawm naw ning a, in inremna ran thâu thilin- hlânhai khawm ngaisak bawk naw ning."
23,Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.,"I ṭingṭang ri mawi chu ngai naw ningah, chuleiin, ka kuoma inthawkin i hla nasêtum chu la hmang rawh."
24,"But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.","Nisienlakhawm, rorêlnahai chu tuihai angin le felna chu vadungpui angin luong raw se."
25,"Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?","“Aw Israel sûngkuohai, kum sâwmli sûngin thlalêra khan inthâwi- nahai le thil inhlânhai ka kuomah in hung lâk am a nih?"
26,"Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.","Anih, in laltak Sikkuth in Molok puon inhai le, in Kiun milim- hai, in arasi pathien, mâni ta dinga in siem chu in phur a."
27,"Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.","Chuleiin, Damaska khaw khêl- tieng salah infetir ka ti cheu,” LALPA, a hming sipaihai Pathien chun a tih."
