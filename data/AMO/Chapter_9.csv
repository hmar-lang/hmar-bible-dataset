9,"For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth.","“Ngai ta u, thu ka pêk ding a ni sih a, chun, sihria bu an rel angin, Israel sûngkuohai chu hnam po po lai chun rel ka tih; nisienlakhawm, a mal chîn tak khawm hnuoi chungah tla naw ni."

13,"Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.","LALPA chun, “Ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung a ni tah, chuong nihaia chun hnuoi inlettu chun bu âttu chu hnawt phâk a ta, grêp chîltu chun chi thetu chu la hnawt phâk a ta; tlâng insâng chun uoin thlum infartir a ta, tlâng po po chu intui an tih."
