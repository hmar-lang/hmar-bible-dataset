1,"Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.","Hieng ang hin Lalpa PATHIEN chun a mîn entir a; en ta u, mâwng nuhnung lem a mâwng ṭan- tirnaa chun khâuṭhikṭhi a siem a; ngai ta u, lal bu hlu hnunga mâwng nuhnung lem a nih."
2,"And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.","Chun, chu rama hlohna chu an fâk zo hnungin, “Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, ngaidam rawh, ka ngên che hi; Jakob chu iengtin am ngîr thei a ta, ama a chîn sih a?” ka tih a."
3,"Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah.","Hi thu tieng hin LALPA chu ân lêt a, LALPA chun, “Ni nâwk ta naw nih,” a ta."
4,"Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to contend by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.","Hieng ang hin Lalpa PATHIEN chun a mîn entir a; chun, en ta u, Lalpa PATHIEN chun meia do dingin a ko a; mei chun tui inthûk lien chu a kâng vawng a; ram khawm chu a kâng zo mêk bawk a."
5,"Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.","chun, keiin, “Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, ma rawh, ka ngên che hi, Jakob chu iengtin am ngîr thei a ta, ama a chîn sih a?” ka ta."
6,"Jehovah repented concerning this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Hi thu tieng hin LALPA chu ân lêt a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun, “Hi khawm hi ni ta naw nih,” a ta."
7,"Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.","Hieng ang hin a mîn entir a, chun, en ta u, Lalpa chu enremnaa siem bang kâwlah a ngîr a, a kuta chun enremna chu a chawi a."
8,"And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Amos, ieng am i hmuh a?” a ta. Kei chun, “Enremna,” ka ta. LALPA chun, “Ngai ta, ka mi Israelhai lai enremna sieng ka ta, anni chu khêl nâwk ta naw ning a;"
9,"and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.","chun, Isak bâwlhmunhai chu rausan hung nîng an ta, Israel hmun inthienghai chu suksiet nîng a tih, chun, Jeroboam sûnghai chu kâwl- hnâmin do ka tih,” a ta."
10,"Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.","Chun, Bethel khaw thiempu Amazia chun Israel lal Jeroboam kuomah, “Amos chun Israel sûnghai lai chun a phierrûk cheh a, ram chun a thu po po chu a tuor thei nawh."
11,"For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.","Amos chun hieng ang hin a ti sih a, ‘Jeroboam chu kâwlhnâmin thîng a ta, matheiloin a rama inthawkin Israel chu salah ṭhuoi suok a ta,’ tiin thu a thawn a,” tiin."
12,"Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:","Chun, Amazia chun Amos kuomah, “Aw nang zâwlnei, fe la, Juda ramah tlân hmang la, chutaka chun bu fa la, thu hril rawh;"
13,"but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.","nisienlakhawm, Bethel khuoah thu hril nâwk ta naw rawh: lal hmun inthieng le lal in a ni leiin,” a ti bawk a."
14,"Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:","Chun, Amos chun Amazia kuomah, “Zâwlnei ka ni nawh a, zâwlnei naupa khawm ka ni bawk nawh; ran ruol vêngtu le thei- chang kûng enkawltu ka ni lem a nih;"
15,"and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.","LALPA chun berâm ruol vêng- naa inthawk chun a mi lâk a, LALPA chun ka kuomah, ‘Fe la, ka mi Israelhai kuomah thu hril rawh,’ a mi tih a."
16,"Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac;","Chuongchun, tuhin LALPA thu chu hre rawh, ‘Nangin Israel kalin thu hril naw la, Isak sûngkuohai kalin i thu inthla naw rawh,’ i tih a;"
17,"therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.","chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘I nuhmei chu khawpuiah nawchizawr nîng a ta, i naupasalhai, i naunuhmeihai chu kâwlhnâmin tlûng an ta; i ram chu inkhina hruiin sem an ta; chun, nangma ngei khawm ram thieng naw sûnga chun thîng i ta, matheiloin, Israel chu a rama inthawkin salah ṭhuoi hmang an tih,’ tiin,” a dawn a."
