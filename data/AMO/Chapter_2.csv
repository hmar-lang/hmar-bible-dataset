2,"But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;","chuleiin, Moab chungah mei tir ka ta, Kerioth lal inhai chu kâng vawng a ta; chun, Moab chu buoina le khêk ri le tawtawrâwt riin thîng a ta,"
3,"and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith Jehovah.","chu laia rorêltu chu sukbo ka ta, a mi lienhai po po chu, ama leh that ka tih,” LALPA chun a tih."
4,"Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk.","LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, “Juda bawsietna pathum leiin, anih, pali leiin, a hremna sukbo naw ning; LALPA dân chu an pawm nawh a, a thupêkhai chu an vawng nawh a;"

6,"Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes—","LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, “Israel bawsietna pathum leiin, anih, pali leiin, a hremna sukbo naw ning; tangka mana mi fel an zawr lei le kekawk bun khat mana mi tlasam an zawr leiin;"
7,"they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the same maiden, to profane my holy name:","rimsi lu chunga pilvut phul châk ngawi ngawi le, zainêmhai lampui sukkâwipêk hlakhai chu: chun, mi pakhat chu a pa leh nunghâk pakhat kuoma ka hming sukse dingin an fe hmunkhat hlak a!"
8,and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.,"mâichâm tin bula puon siekham chunga chun an zâl hlak a, an Pathien ina chun mi an inchawitir manhai chun uoin an dâwn hlak a."
9,"Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.","“Nisienlakhawm, anni hmaah Amor mihai sidar thing anga insâng le thingsaisuo anga hrât khawm kha ka sukbohmang tah a; a chungtienga a ra le, a hnuoitienga a zung khawm ka sukbo a."
10,"Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.","Amor mihai ram chu nei dingin Aigupta rama inthawkin ka ṭhuoi suok cheu a, thlalêra khan kum sâwmli sûngin ka ṭhuoi cheu a."
11,"And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith Jehovah.","Chun, zâwlnei ni dingin in naupasalhai laia mi le Nazirit dâm ni dingin in tlangvâlhai laia mi ka siem a, Aw Israel nauhai, chuong ang chu a ni nâwm a nih?” LALPAIN a tih."
12,"But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.","“Nisienlakhawm, Nazirit mihai kuomah uoin dâwn ding in pêk a, zâwlneihai kuomah, ‘Thu hril naw ro’, tiin thu in pêk a."
13,"Behold, I will press you in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves.","Ngai ta u, buphala sip, tawlailîr ichîl angin in hmuna khan nam ka ti cheu."
14,And flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself;,"Chun, mi tlân hrâthai hrâtna chu bo a ta, mi hrâtin a tha chu sukhrât thei bawk naw ni; mi hrâttak khawm inhum thei naw nih a,"
15,neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself;,thalngul hmangtu khawm chu ngîr thei bawk naw ni; ngalhrât mi khawm inhum thei bawk naw ni; sakawr chung chuong mi khawm inhum thei bawk naw nih;
16,"and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith Jehovah.","chu nia chun mi thilthawthei- tak laia mi huoisen khawm chu sa- ruokin tlân hmang a tih,” LALPAIN a tih."
