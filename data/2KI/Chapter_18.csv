1,"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.","Chun, Ela naupa Israel lal Hosea kum thum ân lal kum chun Juda lal Ahaz naupa Hezekia chu ân lal ṭan a."
2,Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.,"Ân lal ṭantir chun kum sâwmhni le kum nga mi a nih; chun, Jeru- salemah kum sâwmhni le kum kuo ân lal a; a nu hming chu Abi, Zekaria naunu a nih."
3,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.","Chun, a pu David thilthaw ang po thaw vein, LALPA mithmua thil ṭhatak a thaw hlak a."
4,"He removed the high places, and brake the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.","Bâwlhmunhai a sukbo a, lung- phunhai a sukchim a, Asera dâm a phûr a; chun, Mosie dâr rûl siemhai chu a suknâwi vawng a; chuong lai hun chen chun Israel thlahai chun a kuomah riminhnik an la raw rawp hlak a nih; chu chu Nehustan an ti hlak a."
5,"He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him.","Ama chun LALPA Israelhai Pa- thien chu a ring a; chuongchun, ama hnunga Juda lalhai po pohai laiah ama ang tukhawm an um nawh a, ama hmaa khawm an um bawk nawh."
6,"For he clave to Jehovah; he departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPA chu a chel tlat a; ama a zui chu a ma nuom nawh a, a thupêk LALPAIN Mosie a pêkhai chu a zâwm a."
7,"And Jehovah was with him; whithersoever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.","Chuongchun, LALPA chu a kuomah a um a; a suok invâkna taphawta chun a tluongtlung pei a; Assuria lal chunga chun a hel a, a rawng a bâwl ta nawh a."
8,"He smote the Philistines unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.","Philistin mihai chu Gaza khuo chenin a ram chin po po leh, râl vêngtuhai in insânga inthawka kul nei khuo chenin a hne vawng a."
9,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.","Chun, lal Hezekia kum li ân lal kum, Israel lal Ela naupa Hosea kum sari ân lal kum chun Assuria lal Salmaneser chun Samari khuo a hang thawh a, a hang inhuol a."
10,"And at the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.","Chun, kum thum ân vawi kum chun a lâk tah a; Hezekia kum ruk ân lal kum, Israel lal Hosea kum kuo an lal kumin a nih Samari khuo chu a lâk chu."
11,"And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,","Chun, Assuria lal chun Israel- hai chu Assuria ramah a ṭhuoi a, Hala rama dâm, Gozan rama Habor vadunga dâm, Media mihai khuoa dâm ân umtir tah a;"
12,"because they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.","LALPA an Pathien thu chu an pawm nuom nawh a, a thuthlung chu an bawsiet lem a, LALPAIN a siehlaw Mosie thu a pêkhai po pohai ngei kha an pawm nuom nawh a, an thaw nuom naw leiin."
13,"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.","Chun, lal Hezekia kum sâwm le kum li ân lal kumin Assuria ram lal Sennakerib chu Judai rama khuo kulpui nei po pohai chu thaw dingin a hang feh a; a lâk tah a."
14,"And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.","Chun, Juda lal Hezekia chun Lakis khuoa Assuria lal kuoma chun, “Thil ka lo suksuol tah a nih, mîn kiensan nâwk el rawh,” tiin thu a thawn a."
15,"And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king’s house.","Chun, Assuria lal chun Juda lal Hezekia chu tangka talent za thum le rângkachak talent sâwmthum a tuk a. Chuongchun, Hezekia chun LALPA ina tangka um po po le lal ina ro siekhâwmnaa mi po po chu a pêk vawng a."
16,"At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.","Chu ṭum ngei chun Hezekia chun, LALPA biek in kawtkhâra mi le, Juda lal Hezekian bana rângka- chak ân luonhai chu a lâk thlâk vawng a, Assuria lal chu a pêk a nih."
17,"And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.","Chun, Assuria lal chun Tartan dâm, Rabsaris hai dâm, Rabsake hai dâm sipai tamtak leh Lakis khuoa inthawkin Jerusalem khuoa lal Hezekia kuoma chun a tir a. Chun, Jerusalem khuo chu an hang tlung a. An hang tlung chun puon sâwptu phûl lampuia dîl sakhnung lem, tuilâkna kâwla chun an ngîr a."
18,"And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.","Chun, lal chu an hang ko chun, insûng tieng hotu Hilkia naupa Eliakim hai, lekhaziektu Sebna hai, chanchin ziektu Asaph naupa Joa hai an kuomah an va suok a."
19,"And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?","Chun, Rabsake chun an kuom- ah, “Hezekia kuoma chun hang hril ro khai, ‘lal ropuitak Assuria lal chun hieng ang hin a tih, I ring în nghatna hi ieng am a na?"
20,"Thou sayest (but they are but vain words), There is counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?","Indonaa ding chun remruot thiem le hrâtna kan nei a nih i tih a; nisienlakhawm, chu chu ṭawngbau el a nih. Tu am i ring a, ka chunga hel i ni leh?"
21,"Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.","Ngai ta, hi luong hmawl pawr Aigupta hi i ring a ni âwm a; chu chu miin a ringsan chun a kutah sun a tih, Aigupta lal Pharao chu ama ringtuhai po po chunga chun chuong ang chu a ni hlak a nih."
22,"But if ye say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?","Annawleh ka kuomah, LALPA kan Pathien chu a nih ka ring chu, in ti chun, ama chu Hezekia chun Juda- hai le Jerusalem mihai kuoma Jerusalem khuoa hi mâichâm hmaa hin in biek ding a nih, tiin bâwl- hmunhai leh a mâichâmhai a lâk hmangpêk kha a ni naw am a nih?’ tiin."
23,"Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.","Chuongchun, ka pu, Assuria lal le chun thu intiem ro, chuongchun, sakawr sâng hni pêng ka ti che, a chunga chuongtu dinghai i hmu thei ding phawt chun."
24,"How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?","Iengtin am tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai thua Aiguptahai chunga i ringna innghatin, ka pu mihai laia chîntak hotu pakhat khawm hi i dangkîr zo hrim ding am a nih?"
25,"Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.","Chun, hi ram hi LALPA thu ni loa sukse dinga hung am ka nih? LALPAIN ka kuomah, ‘Chu ram chu hang thaw la, sukse rawh, a ti a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
26,"Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.","Chun, Hilkia naupa Eliakim le Sebna le Joa hai chun Rabsake kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin, i sie- hlawhai hi Suria ṭawngin mi be ta lem rawh; chu chu kan hriet thei sih a; kul chunga mihai na hrieta hin Juda ṭawngin mi be ta naw rawh,” an ta."
27,"But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?","Nisienlakhawm, Rabsake chun an kuomah, “Ka pu chun in pu kuom le nangni kuom chaua hieng thu hi hril dingin a mi tir am a nih? Kul chunga ṭhunghai, nangni le anni mâni êk la fa ding le mâni zun la dâwn dinghai kuoma hin a mi tir a ni bawk naw am a nih?” a ta."
28,"Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spake, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.","Chun, Rabsake chu a ngîr a, Juda ṭawngin râwl inringtakin a khêk a, “Lal ropuitak Assuria lal thu hi lo ngai ro."
29,"Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand:","Lal chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘Hezekia hlêmin um naw ro; ama chun ka kuta inthawkin a sansuok thei âwm si naw cheu a;"
30,"neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.","Hezekia chun, LALPAIN mi sanhim ngei a ta; chun, hi khawpui hi Assuria lal kuta chun pêk ni naw nih, tiin LALPA chu inringtir naw raw se cheu."
31,"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;","Hezekia thu chu pawm naw ro, Assuria lal chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih: Mîn rempui unla, ka kuomah hung thla ro, mi tinin mâni grêp hruia mi le, mâni theichang kûnga mi fa seng unla, mi tinin mâni tuikhur tui tlân seng ro:"
32,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.","nangni ram anga bu le uoin ram, bei le grêp huon ram, oliv le khuoizu ram, thi loa in hring theina ding rama ka hung ṭhuoi hmakhat cheu chun; Hezekian, LALPAIN mi sanhim a ta, tiha a thlêm cheu khawmin pawm nuom naw ro."
33,Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?,Hnam tinhai pathien po po laia mi hrim hrimin an ram chu Assuria lala inthawkin an sanhim ta hlak am a nih?
34,"Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?","Hamath le Arpad pathienhai kha khâwlai am an um ta leh? Sepharvaim dâm, Hena dâm, Ivva dâm pathienhai khawm kha khâwlai am an um ta leh? Samari khuo kha keia inthawkin an sanhim am a nih?"
35,"Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?","Ram tin pathienhai po po laia mi chun tuhai am an ram keimaa inthawka sanhim a, LALPA chun Jerusalem khuo hi keimaa inthawkin a sanhim ding hrim am a nih?’ tiin,” a tih a."
36,"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.","Anni chu an to zing a, bau khat khawma an dawn nawh; lal thupêk dân chu, “Anni chu dawn naw ro,” ti a ni sih a."
37,"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.","Chuongchun, lal insûng tieng hotu Hilkia naupa Eliakim hai, le- khaziektu Sebna hai, chanchin ziektu Asaph naupa Joa hai chu an silfên keithlêrhai inbelin Hezekia kuoma chun an feh a, Rabsake thuhrilhai chu an hril a."
