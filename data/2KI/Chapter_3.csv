1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.",Juda ram lal Jehosaphat inlal kum sâwm le kum riet kum chun Ahab naupa Jehoram chun Israelhai chungah Samari khuoah ro a rêl ṭan a; kum sâwm le kum hni lai ro a rêl a.
2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.","Chuongchun, LALPA mithmuah thil suol chu a thawh a, nisienla- khawm, a nu le pa ang loin, Baal lungphun a pain a lo phun tahai chu a phawi hmang a."
3,"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.","Nisienlakhawm, Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolnaa Israel mihai ân suksuoltirnaa khan ân tûl tlat a, chutaka inthawk chun ân sie hmang ngai hrim hrim nawh a."
4,"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.","Chun, Moab lal Mesa chu berâm vai mi a na, Israel lal kuoma chun berâmte nuoi khat le berâmchal nuoi khat hmul chu leiman dingin a pêk hlak a."
5,"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, Ahab a hung thi hnung chun Moab lal chu Israel lal chunga chun a hel tah a."
6,"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.","Chun, chu lai chun lal Jehoram chu Samari khuoa inthawk a suok a, Israel mihai po po chu a ko khâwm a."
7,"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.","Chun, a feh a, Juda lal Jeho- saphat kuoma chun, “Hi Moab lal chu ka chungah a hel a, Moab mihai chu do dingin i mi hung zui ding am a nih?” ti dingin mi a tir a. Chun, ama chun, “Fe vêng ka tih, kei le nang, ka mihai le i mihai chu pumkhat ei nih; ka sakawrhai le i sakawrhai khawm pumkhat an nih,” a ta."
8,"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.","Chun, ama bawkin, “Khawtieng lampui âm fêng ei ta?” a ta. Ama chun, “Edom thlalêr lampui tieng khan,” tiin a dawn a."
9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.","Chuongchun, Israel lal chu, Juda lal le Edom lal le chun an fe tah a, chuongchun, ni sari chu lampui inhêl zâwngin an fe tah a, anni zuitu mipuihai le an sahai ta ding chun tui a um ta nawh a."
10,"And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.","Chun, Israel lal chun, “E hei, LALPA chun hi lal pathumhai hi Moab mihai kuta pêk dingin a ko khâwm a ni ngei el,” a ta."
11,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.","Nisienlakhawm, Jehosaphat chun, “Hitaka hin LALPA zâwlnei, ama hmanga LALPA thu ei indawn theina ding chu an um naw am a nih?” a ta. Chun, Israel lal siehlawhai laia mi pakhat chun, “Saphat naupa, Elisa, Elija kut tuia buok hlaktu chu hitaka hin a um,” tiin, a dawn a."
12,"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.","Chun, Jehosaphat chun, “LAL- PA thu chu ama kuoma chun a um a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Israel lal le Jehosaphat le Edom khaw lal chu ama kuoma chun an zu fe tah a."
13,"And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.","Chun, Elisa chun Israel lal kuoma chun, “Nang le kei hin ieng am inhmangna ei nei a? fe la, i nu le i pa zâwlneihai kuomah fe dai rawh,” a lo tih a. Chun, Israel lal chun a kuomah, “Ni lo e, LALPA chun hi lal pathum- hai hi Moab mihai kuta pêk dingin a mi ko khâwm a ni ta hi,” a ta."
14,"And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.","Chun, Elisa chun, “Sipaihai LALPA, a hmaa ka ngîrna hlak hringna chu sâlin ka hril a nih, Juda lal Jehosaphat hi inza naw lang chu nanga tieng hin a nghat khawm ngha naw ningah, a hmu khawm hmu naw bawk ka ti che."
15,"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, tuhin ṭingṭang keithiem mî mi hung ko pêk ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, ṭingṭang kei- thiemin a kei lai chun LALPA kut chu ama chunga chun a hung tlung tah a."
16,"And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.","Chun, ama chun, “LALPA chun, ‘Hi ruom po po hi khurin suksip vawng ro,’ a ti a nih."
17,"For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.","Chun, LALPA bawkin, ‘Thli hmu naw ti niu a, ruo khawm hmu bawk naw ti niu, amiruokchu, chu ruom chu tuiin hung sip a ta, nangni le in ranruol le in sahai chun tlân in tih,’ a ti a nih."
18,And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.,"Chun, hi thil hi LALPA mit- hmua chun thil chitê a na, chun, Moab mihai khawm chu in kutah pe bawk a ti cheu."
19,"And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.","Chun, khawpui kul nei po pohai le, khawpui ṭhahai po po chu suk- sieng in ta, thing ṭhahai po po chu phûrthlu bawk in ta, chun, tuikhur tuihnâr nei tinhai chu sukbit in ta, ram ṭha po pohai chu lungin dêngsip bawk in tih,” a ta."
20,"And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.","Chun, zîngkâr thilinhlân hun vêl lai hin hieng hi a hung na, ngai ta, Edom ram tienga inthawk chun tui a hung luong a, a ram chun tuiin a hung sip tah a."
21,"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.","Chun, Moab mihai chun lalhai chu anni do dingin an hung ti an hriet phingleh, anni chu an inko khâwm tâwl a; râlthuoma inthuom thei taphawt le, a chungtieng pohai chu ramria chun an lo ṭhang a."
22,"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:","Chun, zîngkâr chun inhma- takin an tho a, nisa chun chu tui chu a hung el tle pup a; chuongchun, Moab mihai chun an hmazâwna tui chu thisen ang elin an hmuh a,"
23,"and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.","“Hi hi thisen a ni ngei hi, anni le anni chu an inthat tuoh a, lalhai chu sukhlum vawng an ni ta ngei a ni hi. Moab mihai, râllâk sum chu vân chu ro khai,” an ta."
24,"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.","Chun, Israel mihai riebûka an hung chun, Israelhai chu an tho a, Moab mihai chu an that a; chuong- chun, an hmaa chun an tlânse tah a, chuongchun, Moab mihai chu that peiin an ramah an hnawt lût tah a."
25,"And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth only they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.","Chun, khawpuihai chu an sukchim a, ram ṭhatna hmun poah mi tinin lung an pei seng a, an suksip pei a; chun, tuikhur hnâr nei po po chu an sukbit bawk a, thing ṭhahai po po chu an phûrthlûk a, Kir-hareseth khuoa lung chau an mâksan a; nisienla- khawm, vailungdêngna dêng mihai chun an va fe hêl a, an thaw tah a."
26,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.","Chun, Moab lal chun ama ta dingin indona chu a nasa taluo ti a hriet phingleh Edom lal umna hmun chen chu va suktlang dingin kâwl- hnâm chawi mi za sari a ṭhuoi a, nisienlakhawm, an thei nawh a."
27,"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.","Chun, a naupasal upatak ama aia rorêl ding chu a lâk a, kul chunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân ding- in ân hlân tah a. Israel mihai chunga chun lunginsenna nasatak chu a um tah a, chuongchun, ama chu an mâksan a, an rama chun an kîr nâwk tah a."
