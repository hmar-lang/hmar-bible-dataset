1,"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lal Hezekia chun chu chu a hriet chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a, saiip puon ân bel a, LALPA ina chun a lût tah a."
2,"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.","Chun, insûng tieng hotu Eliakim le, lekhaziektu Sebna hai, thiempu upahai chu saiip puon inbelin Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai kuomah a tir a."
3,"And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Hezekia chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Vawisûn ni hi lunginzîngna ni le, halna ni le hmingsietna ni a nih; nauhai chu an pieng a hun ta sih a, nei dingin hrât- na a um ta si nawh."
4,"It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.","A pu Assuria lalin Pathien hring hming hrilse dinga a tir Rabsake thuhrilhai po po chu, LALPA i Pathien chun hrieng a ta, a thuhril, LALPA i Pathienin a thu hriet chu a la kâwk rawi mawh; chu chu lei chun a la um sunhai chu ṭawngṭaipêk rawh,’ a ti che,” an ta."
5,So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.,"Chuongchun, lal Hezekia mihai chu Isai kuomah an feh a."
6,"And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.","Isai chun an kuomah, “In lalpa kuomah hieng ang hin hril ro,’ LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, I thu hriet, Assuria lal mihaiin an mi hrilsietna kha ṭi naw rawh."
7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.","Ngai ta, a sûnga chun thlarau inumtir ka ta, thuthang hrieng a ta, ama ramah fe nâwk a tih; chuong- chun, ama ram ngeia chun kâwl- hnâma sukthlûkin inumtir ka tih, a tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
8,"So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.","Chuongchun, Rabsake chu a kîr nâwk a, Assuria lal chun Libna khuo a lo thaw lai chu a va hmuh a; Lakis khuoa inthawk chun a suok tah ti a hriet hrim a na."
9,"And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee, he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,","Chun, “Ngai ta, nangma chu thaw dingin a suok tah,” tia Tirhaka, Ethiopia ram lal chungchâng thu Assuria lal Sennakerib mi hril a lo hriet chun, Hezekia kuomah mihai a tir a,"
10,"Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.","“Hieng ang hin Juda lal Hezekia kuoma chun hril ro, ‘I Pathien i ring chun Jerusalem khuo Assuria lal kuta pêk ni naw nih tiin hlêm naw raw se che."
11,"Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?","Ngai ta, Assuria lalhaiin ram po po sukse vawnga, a chunga an thil- thawhai kha i hriet a; nang hi sanhim i ni bîk ding am a nih?"
12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?","Hnam tin pathienhai chun ka pi le puhaiin an sukbohmanghai kha an sanhim hlak am a nih? Gozan dâm, Haran dâm, Rezeph dâm, Eden nau hai Telassar khuoa umhai,"
13,"Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?","Hammath lal hai, Arpad lal hai, Sepharvaim khawpui lal hai, Hena lal dâm, Ivva lal dâm kha khâwlai am an um ta leh?’ tiin,” a ta."
14,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.","Chun, Hezekia chun a mitirhai kuta inthawk chun lekha a hmuh a, a hang tiem a: chuongchun, Hezekia chu LALPA ina chun a hang lût a, LALPA hmaa chun a phar a."
15,"And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, that sittest above the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.","Chun, Hezekia chu LALPA hmaah a ṭawngṭai a, “Aw LALPA, cherubhai chunga ṭhung, Israel Pa- thien, nang, nang chau hi hnuoi chung ram po po Pathien chu i nih; hnuoi le vân hi nangma siem a nih."
16,"Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to defy the living God.","Aw LALPA, i na lo sit la, ngai ta, Aw LALPA i mit meng la, en ta; Pathien hring chu hrilse dinga Sen- nakeribin thu a hung hril hi ngai ta;"
17,"Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,","LALPA, Assuria lalhaiin hnam- hai le an ramhai chu an suksiet hlak luoh a;"
18,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.","an pathienhai chu meiah an pei bawk hlak a; chuonghai chu pathien an ni naw hrim a, mihriem kuta siem, thing le lung an ni lem a nih; chu lei chun an sukbohmang a nih."
19,"Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save thou us, I beseech thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Jehovah art God alone.","Chuleiin, aw LALPA kan Pa- thien, nang, nangma chau hi LALPA Pathien i nih ti hnuoi chung ram po po hin an hriet theina dingin amaa inthawk hin mi sanhim ngei ngei rawh,” tiin."
20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard thee.","Chuong lai chun Amoz naupa Isai chun Hezekia kuomah, “LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih ‘Assuria lal Sennakerib sietna ding tienga ka kuoma i ṭawngṭai kha ka lo hriet,’ tiin, mi a tir a."
21,This is the word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.,"Hi hi a chungchâng thu LALPA- IN a hril chu a nih, ‘Zion naunu nunghâk chun a hmusit cheh a, a nuisan che a nih; Jerusalem naunu chun a lu a thin khum bawk cheh a."
22,Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.,"Tu am i sukhmingsiet a, i hril- siet? Tu chung âm i râwl i sukpuom a, i mit i meng insâng? Israel Mi Inthieng chunga hin annâwm."
23,"By thy messengers thou hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field.",I mitirhai hmangin LALPA chu i sukhmingsiet a. Ka tawlailîr tamtak leh Lebanon ramril tlâng insânghai ka hung tlung tah a; chutaka Sidar thing insângtakhai le fâr thing ṭha ṭhahai chu phûr ka ta; a hnuoi ṭhatna hmun rampui umna hmuna chun lût ka tih.
24,"I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.","Ram dang tui ka cho suok a, ka tlân hlak a, ka kepha hnuoi hin Aigupta vadunghai po po chu suk- kang vawng ka tih, i tih a."
25,"Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.","Keimain inhmaa inthawka chuong chu ka thaw a nizie dâm, inhma laia chuong chu ka siem a nizie dâm chu i hriet naw am a nih? Khaw kul neihai chu in chim khâwm el anga suksetu dingin ka ruot ta che a ni hi."
26,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.","Chuleiin, a sûnga umhai chun hrâtna an nei nawh a, an zâm a, an hung muolpho ta kha; phûl hlobet ang le hna hring ang le, in chunga hlobet ang le, bu lien hmaa thli em vuoi ang an ni kha."
27,"But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.","Kei chun i ṭhung dâm, i lût le i suok dâm, ka chunga i lunginsen hi ka hriet i sawnnaw."
28,"Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.","Ka chunga i lunginsen lei le, i ṭawng uong chu ka naa a hung lût tâk leiin ka hnâr inbûk chu i hnârah inbûk ka ta, ka thîrse chu i hmûrah, i hungna lampuia ngei khan inkîrtir nâwk ka ti che,’ tiin."
29,"And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.","Chun, hi hi i ta dinga inchikna nîng a ta, tu kum hin bu inhli ring in ta, kum nâwk khawm bu inhli bawk; chun, a kum thumnaa chun buhai tu unla, sîk unla, grêp huonhai siem unla, a rahai fa ro."
30,"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.","Chuongchun, Juda sûnghai laia a la dam sunhai chun a suktiengin zung kei an ta, a tung zâwngin ra nâwk an tih."
31,"For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall perform this.","Jerusalema inthawkin a la um sunhai, Zion tlânga inthawkin a la damhai chu an suok ding a nih: LALPA ṭhahnemngaina chun chuong chu thâwng a tih."
32,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun Assuria lal chungchâng thu chu hieng ang hin a hril: ‘Hi khawpui hi hung tlung naw nih a, hitaka hin thal kâp bawk naw nih; phaw leh a kâwla hin hung bawk naw nih a, a khaw hrûla hin hnuoi dêng pâwng bawk naw ni hai."
33,"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.","An hungna lampuiah, chutaka ngei chun lêt nâwk a ta, hi khawpui hi hung tlung naw nih,’ LALPAIN a tih."
34,"For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.","Keima lei le ka siehlaw David leiin hi khawpui hi sanhim dingin ka vêng ding a nih,” tiin."
35,"And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.","Chuongchun, chu zân chun hieng ang hi a hung na, LALPA vân- tirko chu ân thawk suok a, Assuria mihai riekhmuna chun mi nuoi khât le sîng riet le sâng nga a sukhlum a; chun, zîngkâra an hang tho chun, ngai ta, mithi ruong khât el a lo ni tah el a."
36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.","Chuongchun, Assuria lal Sen- nakerib chu a suok a, a kîr nâwk a, a fe nâwk ta pei a, Ninevi khuoa chun a um tah a."
37,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, a pathien Nisrok ina chun ama a biek laiin hieng ang hi a hung na, Adrammelek le Sarezer hai chun ama chu kâwlhnâmin an sukhlum tah a; chuongchun, Ararat rama chun an tlân lût tah a. Chun, a naupa Esar-haddon chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
