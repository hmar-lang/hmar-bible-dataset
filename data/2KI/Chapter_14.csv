26,"For Jehovah saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.",LALPAIN Israelhai rinumzie chu a nasa êm êm a nih ti a hriet sih a; khuokhir le khir nawhai khawm an um chuong si nawh a; Israelhai ṭhangpuitu ding tukhawm an um bawk nawh.
