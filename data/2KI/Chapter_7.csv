1,"And Elisha said, Hear ye the word of Jehovah: thus saith Jehovah, To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.","Elisa chun, “LALPA thu hi lo hre ta u, LALPA chun, hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Zingah hieng tik phât vêla hin Samari kul kawtkhâr bula chun beiphit indi mi tekhâwng khat chu shekel khatah zawr an ta, buṭei tekhâwng hni chu shekel khatah,’ tiin,” a ta."
2,"Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.","Chun, sipai hotu, lalin a kut a ihung ringsan chun, Pathien mi chu a dawn a, “Ngai ta, LALPAIN vânah tukver a hawng ding a ni chu aw! Chuong ang chu a ni thei hlak ding am a nih?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Ngai rawh, i mit chun chu hmu ngei i ta, a fâk ruok chu i fâk naw ding a nih,” a ta."
3,"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?","Chun, kul lûtna kawtkhâr bula chun inphâr pali an um a; anni chun, “Iengdinga thi nghâk ela ei inṭhung zing am a na?"
4,"If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.","‘Khaw sûnga hin lût ei tiu khai,’ ti ding ni inla, khaw sûng an ṭâm a, ei va thi el âwm sih a; chun, hitaka hin ṭhung zing inla, ei thi tho tho bawk âwm sih a. Chuleiin, thaw ta u, Suria sipaihai tieng hin tlu lût rawk el ei tiu, an mi hla leh ei hring nîng a ta, an mi that le hlak ei thi nîng a ta,” tiin an inbiek a."
5,"And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.","Chuongchun, Suria mihai riek- hmuna fe ding chun thimbut hin an inthawk suok tah a; chun, Suria mi- hai riekhmun tawntir an va tlung chun, ngai ta, tukhawm an lo um nawh a."
6,"For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.","LALPAIN Suria sipaihai chu tawlailîr ri dâm, sakawr ri dâm, sipai tamtak ri dâm ân hriettir a nih, chuongchun, “Ngai ta u, Israel lal hin, Hit lalhai, Aigupta lalhai hi eini mi thaw ding hin a hung ruoi a ni hi,” tiin an inbiek a."
7,"Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.","Chuongchun, an tho a, inthim lai chun an tlânse tah a, an puon inhai, an sakawrhai, an sabengtunghai le an riekhmun chu a um ngai ngaiin an tlânsan a, an tlânse ta rak el a."
8,"And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.","Chun, chuong inphârhai chun riekhmun tawntir an va tlung chun puon in pakhata hin an va lût a, an fâkin an dâwn a, chutaka tangkaruo dâm, silfênhai chu an lâk a, an va thuphmang a; chun, an va kîr nâwk a, puon in dangah an lût nâwk a, chu- taka mi khawm chu an lâk a, an va thuphmang nâwk a."
9,"Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.","A nakie chun, “Ei sukdik naw tawp el a, vawisûn hi chanchin lâwm- um intlun ni a nih, eini hi ei to zing el a; khawvar ei nghâk chun hrem tuok el ei tih, chuongchun, thaw ta u, lal sûnghai va hril ei tiu,” tiin an in- biek a."
10,"So they came and called unto the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.","Chuongchun, khaw kawtkhâr vêngtu chu an va ko a, “Suria mihai riekhmunah kan va feh a; chun, ngai ta, tukhawm an lo um nawh a, mihriem riva hrim hrim khawm a um nawh a, sakawrhai le sabengtunghai chau a lo inthlung a, puon inhai khawm chu a um ngai ngaiin a um zing el,” tiin an hril a."
11,And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s household within.,"Chun, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu a ko a; chun, anni chun lal in sûnga mihai chu an va hril a."
12,"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.","Chun, lal chu zâna chun a tho a, a upahai kuoma chun, “Suria mihai mi thaw dân hi hril ka ti cheu, Ei phîngṭâmzie hi an hriet a, chuleiin, ‘Khawpuia inthawka an hung suok chun a hringin lo man ei ta, khaw- sûnga chun lût el ei tih,’ tiin rama inbihmang dingin an riekhmun an suoksan a ni hi,” a ta."
13,"And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed); and let us send and see.","Chun, a upa pakhat chun a dawn a, “Khawpuia sakawr um sun panga hi tuhai amanih inṭhuoitir raw khai, (ngai ta, Israel mipuihai, a la damhai po po ang an ni tho tho va, ngai ta, Israel mipuihai thia ngaihai ang bawk an ni tho tho annâwm;) chuongchun, va tir phawt ei tiu khai,” a ta."
14,"They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.","Chuongchun, tawlailîr keitu sakawr pahni an ṭhuoi a; chun, lal chun, “Va en phawt ta u,” tiin, Suria sipaihai hnawt ding chun a tir a."
15,"And they went after them unto the Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.","Chun, Jordan vadung chenin an va hnawt a, chun, ngai ta, Suria mi- hai chun an inhmaw leia an pei silfên- hai le thuomhnawhai chu lampui intluonin a um zel zul el a. Chun, a mi tirhai chu an hung kîr nâwk a, lal chu an hung hril a."
16,"And the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.","Chun, mipuihai chu an va suok a, Suria mihai riekhmun chu an va dap ta rak a. Chuongchun, LALPA thu ang ngeiin beiphit indi mi te- khâwng khat chu shekel khatah an zawr a, buṭei tekhâwng hni chu shekel khatah."
17,"And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.","Chun, lal chun sipai hotu a kut a ihung ringsan kha kul kawtkhâr vêngtuah a ruot a; chun, mipuihai chun kul kawtkhâr bula chun an chîl ta nuoi nuoi el a, Pathien miin a kuoma lal a hung thla laia a lo hril ang khan a thi tah a."
18,"And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;","Hieng hi a hung na, Pathien mi chun lal kuomah, “Zingah hieng tik phât hin Samari kul kawtkhâr bul- ah buṭei tekhâwng hni chu shekel khatah zawr an ta, beiphit indi mi tekhâwng khat chu shekel khatah,” a tih a;"
19,"and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? and he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof:","chun, sipai hotuin Pathien mi chu a dawn a, “Ngai ta, LALPAIN vânah tukver a hawng ding a ni chu tie! Chuong ang chu ni thei hlak a ti maw?” a tih a, ama chun “Ngai rawh, i mit chun hmûng i ta, fâk ruok chu i fâk naw ding a nih,” tia a hril kha;"
20,"it came to pass even so unto him; for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.","chuong ang ngei chun a chung- ah a hung tlung tah a nih; mipui chun kul kawtkhâr bula chun an chîl nuoi nuoi a, a thi tah a nih."
