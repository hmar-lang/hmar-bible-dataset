1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.","Ân lal lai chun Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar a hung lien a, Jehoiakim chu a siehlawah kum thum a um a; chu hnunga chun a nghatsan a, a chungah a hel tah a."
2,"And Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servants the prophets.","Chun, LALPAIN Kaldai pâwlhai, Suria pâwlhai, Moab pâwlhai, Ammon thla pâwlhai ama thaw dingin a tir suok tah a; a siehlaw zâwlneihai hmanga a hril LALPA thu anga Juda ram chu insuksiettir dingin."
3,"Surely at the commandment of Jehovah came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,","A hmu phâk nawa sawn ding thu chu LALPA thuin Juda ram chungah a hung tlung ta ngei a. Manasse suolnahai le a thilthaw po po le,"
4,and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Jehovah would not pardon.,"pawitâwklo thisen an suo a, Jerusalem chu pawitâwklo thisena a suksip leiin, LALPAIN a ngaidam nuom naw a nih."
5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Jehoiakim chan- chin danghai le a thilthaw po po chu Juda lalhai inlal lai chanchin ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
6,So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.,"Chuongchun, Jehoiakim chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in a, chun, a naupa Jehoiakin chu ama aiawiin ân lal tah a."
7,"And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.","Chun, Aigupta lal chu a rama inthawkin a hung suok nâwk ta nawh a; Babulon lal chun Aigupta ram vadungtêa inthawka Euphrates vadung chena Aigupta lal ram huop po po a lâk ta sih a."
8,Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.,"Jehoiakin chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwm le kum riet a na, Jeru- salema chun thla thum ân lal a; a nu hming chu Nehusta, Jerusalema Elnathan naunu a nih."
9,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father had done.","Chun, a pa thaw dân ang po po thawin, LALPA mithmua thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.","Chuong lai chun Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar mihai chu Jerusa- lema chun an hang feh a, khuo chu an hang inhuol tah a."
11,"And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it;","Chun, chuonga a mihaiin an inhuol lai chun Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzar chu khuoa chun a hang feh a;"
12,"and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.","chuongchun, Juda lal Jehoiakin chu a nu hai dâm, a mihai dâm, a milienhai dâm, a upahai le chun Babulon lal kuomah an va suok a, chun, ân lal kum riet kumin Babulon lal chun a man tah a."
13,"And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.","Chun, LALPA hril ang khan, LALPA ina ro po po le lal ina ro po po chu a lâk suok a, LALPA biek ina Israel lal Solomonin rângkachak bûr le bêl a siemhai po po chu a sâtnawi vawng a."
14,"And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.","Chun, Jerusalema mi po po, mi lien po pohai, mi hrât huoisen ṭha po pohai dâm, sing khat zet, themthiem le thirsu po po salah a ṭhuoi vawng a; chu rama mi a pasie sie ti lo chu tukhawm an um ta nawh a."
15,"And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.","Chun, Jehoiakin chu Babulon- ah a ṭhuoi a; chun, lal nu hai, lal nuhmei hai, a upahai dâm, chu rama mihrâthai chu Jerusalema inthawkin Babulonah salah a ṭhuoi a."
16,"And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.","Chun, Babulon lal chun pasal- ṭha po po sâng sari zet le, themthiem le thirsu sâng khat, mi hrât ṭha indo thei mi ṭhieu chu Babulonah salah a ṭhuoi vawng a."
17,"And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s father’s brother, king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.","Chun, a pa unau Mattania chu Babulon lal chun ama aiin ân laltir a, a hming chu Zedekia tiin a thlengpêk a."
18,Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.,"Zedekia chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwmhni le kum khat a na, Jerusa- lemah kum sâwm le kum khat ân lal a, a nu hming chu Hamutal, Libna khuoa Jeremia naunu a nih."
19,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.","Chun, Jehoiakim thaw dân ang po po thawin LALPA mithmua thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
20,"For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.","LALPA lunginsenna leia a hmu phâk nawa a hnawthmang dai chenin Jerusalem le Juda chungah thil a hung tlung pei a nih; chun, Zedekia chu Babulon lal chunga chun a hel tah a."
