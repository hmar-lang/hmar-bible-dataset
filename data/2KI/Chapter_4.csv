1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.","Chun, zâwlnei naupasalhai nu- hmeihai laia nuhmei tu amani chu a khêk a, Elisa kuomah, “I siehlaw ka pasal chu a thi tah a, i siehlaw chun LALPA a ṭi hlak ti i hriet a, chuongchun, a leibatnapa a hung a, ka nauhai pahni suoka um dingin ama kuomah ṭhuoi a tum a nih,” a ta."
2,"And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.","Elisa chun a kuomah, “I ta dingin ieng am thawpêk ka ti che a? Mi hril rawh, i inah ieng am i nei a?” a ta. Chun, amanu chun, “I siehlawnu hin inah hriek bûr khat ti chau naw chu iengkhawm ka nei dêr nawh,” a ta."
3,"Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.","Chun, Ama chun, “Fe la, i tuolbâwmhai bêl po po, bêl ruokhai chu, haw khâwm ṭeu rawh; tlâwmte chu haw naw rawh."
4,"And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.","Chun, lût i ta, i naupasalhai le nang chu kawt inkhârkhum in ta, chuongchun, chuong bêl po pohaia chun hriek chu sung rawh, chun a sip chu sie hmang pei bawk la,” a ta."
5,"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out.","Chun, a kuoma inthawk chun a fe tah a, a naupasalhai le ama chu kawt an inkhârkhum a; chun, bêlhai chu a kuomah an hung lâk a, ama chun a lo thun pei a."
6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.","Chun, bêlhai po po chu a sip phingleh, a naupa kuoma chun, “Bêl dang mi la hung lapêk rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Bêl dang a um ta nawh,” a ta. Chun, hriek chu a kang tah a."
7,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.","Chun, a hung a, Pathien mi chu a hril a, ama chun a kuomah, “Fe la, hriek chu zawr la, i bat chu thung la, a la chuong chun nang le i naupa- salhai chu inchâwmna ro,” a lo tih a."
8,"And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.","Chun, ni khat chu hieng hi a hung na, Elisa chu Sunem khuoah ân zin a, chu khuoa chun nuhmei nei- nungtak hi a um a, ama chun Elisa chu bu fa dingin a lo ko ṭâl hlak a. Chun, chutaka a fe po le chun, chu- taka chun bu fa dingin a lût hlak a."
9,"And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually.","Chun, ama chun a pasal kuomah, “Ngai ta, hi mipa mi hung sir rawp hlaktu hi Pathien mi inthieng a nih ti ka hriet a nih."
10,"Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.","Ka ngên che hi, in sâwng chîtê bâwl ei ta, chutaka chun khum leh, dawkân leh, ṭhungna le khâwnvar siena sieng ei ta, a hung poleh chu- taka a lût theina dingin,” a ta."
11,"And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.","Chun, ni khat chu chutieng chun a hung inzin a, pindana chun a lût a, a zâl tah a."
12,"And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.","Chun, a siehlaw Gehazi kuoma chun, “Hi Sunamnu hi hung ko ta,” a ta. Chun, a hang ko hnung chun, a hmaa chun a hung ngîr a."
13,"And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, hi nangin theitâwpin i mi duot a, ieng am thawpêk vêng ka ti cheh a? lal amanih, sipai hotu ama- nih biekpêk che i nuom am, tiin a kuoma hin hril ta,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Mâni chipui laia chêng ka nih annâwm,” a ta."
14,"And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.","Chun, ama chun, “Ieng am ei thawpêk ding a ni chu aw?” a ta. Gehazi chun, “Naupasal a nei dêr luo nawh a, a pasal khawm tar a ni tah,” tiin a dawn a."
15,"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.","Chun, ama chun, “Ama chu hung ko rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chu a hung ko chun kawtkhâra chun a ngîr a."
16,"And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.","Chun, ama chun, “Hi hun pha hin, hun a hung inlet nâwk pha chun naupasal pawm tâng i tih,” a ta. Chun, ama minu chun, “Ni lo e, pu, nang Pathien mi, i siehlawnu kuoma hin khêl hril naw rawh,” a ta."
17,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.","Chun, nuhmei chu ân rai a, a kuoma Elisain a hril hun, chu hun chu a hung tlung chun naupasal a nei tah a."
18,"And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.","Chun, naupang chu a hung inṭhang lien a; ni khat chu a pa kuoma busîktuhai kuomah a fe veh a."
19,"And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.","Chun, a pa kuoma chun, “Ka lu, ka lu,” a ta. Chun, ama chun a sie- hlaw kuoma chun, “A nu kuomah ama kha ṭhuoi rawh,” a ta."
20,"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.","Chun, ama chun a pawm a, a nu kuom a hang tlungpui chun, a nu khûp chungah nisa inding chen chu a ṭhung a; chun, a thi tah a."
21,"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.","Chun, a hang feh a, ama chu Pathien mi khum chunga chun ân zâl tah a; chun, kawt a khârkhum a, ama chu a suok tah a."
22,"And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.","Chun, a pasal chu a ko a, “Ka ngên che hi, Pathien mi kuomah ka va tlâna ka hung kîr nâwk vak theina dingin siehlaw pakhat le sabengtung pakhat kha mi hung ngaituopêk rawh,” a ta."
23,"And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.","Chun, ama chun, “Vawisûn kher kher iengdingin am ama kuoma chun fêng i ta? thla thar a ni nawh a, Châwlni khawm a ni bawk si nawh a,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Ṭha tho de nih,” a ta."
24,"Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.","Chun, sabengtung chu a chuongpha a phah a, a siehlaw kuom- a chun, “Khal la, hmatieng fe pei rawh, ka tir chau naw che chun mi sukmuong naw rawh,” a ta."
25,"So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:","Chuongchun, a feh a, Karmel tlânga Pathien mi kuoma chun a hang fe tah a. Chun, Pathien mi chun ama chu hlataka a um lai chun a lo hmuh a, a siehlaw Gehazi kuoma chun, “En ta, sawtaka saw Sunamnu kha a nih,"
26,"run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.","tuhin ama tuok dingin tlân la, a kuomah, ‘Nang i dam de maw? i pasal kha a dam de maw? naupang kha a dam de maw?’ lo va ti rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Dam e,” tiin a lo dawn pei a."
27,"And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.","Chun, tlânga Pathien mi kuom a hung tlung chun a kephahai chu a chel tlat a. Gehazi chu ama hnawt- kieng ding chun a hung hnai a, ni- sienlakhawm, Pathien mi chun, “Tosan phawt el rawh, a sûngah a lungril a lungngai a nih, LALPA chun chu chu a thup a, ka kuomah a la hril hri si nawh,” a ta."
28,"Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?","Ama chun a kuomah, “Pu, naupasal ka hni hrim che am a nih? Mi hlêm naw rawh, ka ti hrim a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
29,"Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.","Chun, ama chun Gehazi kuoma chun, “I dier kei ṭha la, i kutah ka hmawl kha chawi la fe raw khai; mi tukhawm în tuokpui chun chibai bûk naw la, chun, tukhawma chibai an bûk che khawma bûk thung naw rawh; chun, ka hmawl hi naupang hmai chunga chun innghat rawh,” a ta."
30,"And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.","Chun, naupang nu chun, “LALPA hringna le nanga hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, inthla naw ning che,” a ta. Chun, a tho a, a zui tah a."
31,"And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.","Gehazi chun anni chu a lo hmakhal a, naupang hmai chunga chun hmawl chu a lo innghat a; nisienlakhawm, râwl hrim hrim le a dawn tina hrim hrim chu a um nawh a. Chuleichun, ama chu lo tuok dingin Gehazi chu a va kîr a; “Naupang chu a meng naw tawp el,” a tih a, a lo hril a."
32,"And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.","Chun, Elisa chu in a hung lût chun ngai ta, naupang chu a thi tah a, khuma chun a lo zâl a."
33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah.","Chuongchun, a va lût a, an pahni chun kawt ân khârkhum a, LALPA kuoma chun a ṭawngṭai tah a."
34,"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.","Chun, a hang feh a, naupang chunga chun a hang bawk a; chuong- chun, a bau chungah a bau, a mithai chungah a mithai, a kuthai chungah a kuthai a sieh a; chuongchun, nau- pang chunga chun a zuk bawk nâwk a; chun, naupang taksa chu a hung lum tah a."
35,"Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.","Chun, a hung kîr a, in sûnga chun hnungtieng hmatieng hin vawi- khat ân lawn a; chun, a hang feh a, a chunga chun a hang bawk nâwk a; chun, naupang chu vawi sari a hung insim a, chuongchun, a mit a hung meng tah a."
36,"And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.","Chun, Gehazi chu a ko a, “Su- namnu kha hung ko rawh,” a ta. Ama chun nuhmei chu a hung ko a, a kuoma a hung lût chun, a kuomah, “I naupa kha pawm rawh,” a ta."
37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.","Chun, ama minu chu a va lût a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a, chun, a naupa chu a pawm a, a suok tah a."
38,"And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.","Chun, Elisa chu Gilgalah a fe nâwk a; chun, chu rama chun ṭâm nasatak a tlah a; zâwlnei naupa- salhai chu a hmaa chun an ṭhung a, a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Bel lientak inchuon la, zâwlnei naupasalhai ta dingin hmepawk suong rawh,” a ta."
39,"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.","Chun, mi pakhat chu ramah anhna zawng dingin a va feh a; grêp suok hrui hi a va hmuh a; chutaka ûmzâm chu a pawm khawp ṭeuin a hung inkhâwm bawk a, a hung a, a channawi a, hmepawk bêla chun a thlâk tah a; an hriet si nawh a."
40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.","Chun, mihai ta ding chun an fâk dingin an hung thur suok a, chun, an fâk lai chun, “Aw Pathien mi, bêla hin thina hri a um a nih,” tiin an khêk suok a. Chuongchun, an fâk thei ta nawh a."
41,"But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.","Ama chun, “Chuong a ni chun, beiphit hung la ro,” a ta. Bêl sûnga chun a dêng lût a, “Mipui fâk dingin thur suok ta ro,” a tih a. Chuongchun, bêl sûnga chun thil ṭha naw hrim chu a um ta nawh a."
42,"And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.","Chun, Baal-salisaa inthawkin mi pakhat a hung a, Pathien mi chu ra hmasa bei, buṭei bei sâwmhni le bu thar vui a ipin a hung chawipêk a. Elisa chun, “An fâk dingin mipuihai kha pe rawh,” a tih a."
43,"And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.","A siehlaw chun, “Iengtin am hi hi mi za khat hmaa chun fâk dingin sieng ka ta?” a tih a. Nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “An fâk dingin mipuihai kuoma chun pe rawh, LALPA chun ‘Fâng an ta, fa sêng naw ni hai,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
44,"So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, an hmaa chun a sieh a, an fâk tah a, LALPA thu ang ngei chun an fâk sêng ta nawh a."
