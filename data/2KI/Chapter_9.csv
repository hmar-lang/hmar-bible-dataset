1,"And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.","Chun, zâwlnei Elisa chun zâwl- neihai naupasalhai laia pakhat chu a ko a, a kuomah, “I dier kei la, hi hriek bâwm hi chawi la, Ramoth- gilead khuoah va fe rawh;"
2,"And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber.","i va tlung chun Nimsi naupa Jehosaphat naupa Jehu chu va zawng suok la, pindan sûngrilah lûtpui la."
3,"Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.","Chuongchun, hriek bâwm hi la la, a lua chun buok la, ‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih; Israelhai chunga lal dingin hriek ka nâl che, tiin,’ ti rawh. Chuongchun, kawt hawng la, tlân suok el rawh, um sâwt loin,” a ta."
4,"So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.","Chuongchun, tlangvâl, zâwlnei tlangvâl chu Ramoth-gileada chun a fe tah a."
5,"And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.","Chun, a va tlung chun, ngai ta, sipai hotuhai an lo ṭhung khâwm a; chun, ama chun, “Sipai hotu, i kuomah thu incha hril ding ka nei,” a ta. Chun, Jehu chun, “tu tak kuoma hin am a nih a?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Nanga kuoma hin a nih, sipai hotu,” a ta."
6,"And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, even over Israel.","Chun, a tho a, ina chun a lût a; chun, a lua chun hriek chu a buok a, a kuomah, “LALPA, Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘LALPA mipuihai, Israelhai chunga lal dingin hriek ka nâl che."
7,"And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.",Ka siehlaw zâwlneihai thisen le LALPA siehlaw po pohai thisen phuba chu Jezebela inthawka ka lâk theina dingin i pu Ahab sûnghai chu sukbohmang vawng i tih.
8,"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel.","Ahab sûnghai po po chu bohmang vawng an ta; Ahaba inthawk hin naupasal taphawt chu Israel rama mi khuokhir amanih, khuokhir naw amanih khawm ka sukbohmang ding a nih."
9,"And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.","Chun, Ahab sûnghai chu Nebat naupa Jeroboam sûnghai le Ahija naupa Baasa sûnghai angin siem ka tih."
10,"And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.","Chun, uiin Jezebel chu Jezreel khaw kul bula chun fâng an ta, a phûmtu ding hrim hrim um naw ni hai,’ tiin,” a ta."
11,"Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and what his talk was.","Chuongchun, kawt a hawng a, a tlân suok tah a. Chun, Jehu chu a pu upahai lai chun a hung suok a; pakhat chun a kuomah, “Ṭha tieng thu am a nih? Kha invêtpa kha i kuoma iengtiziea hung am a ni leh?” a ta. Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “In hriet mi a na, a thu hril khawm kha in hriet annâwm,” a ta."
12,"And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel.","Anni chun, “Hre lo ve a, mi hang hril ta khai” an ta. Ama chun, “Hieng ang tak hin a mi ti a ni kha tie! ‘LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, Israelhai chunga lal dingin hriek ka nâl che, tiin,’” a ta."
13,"Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king.","Chuongchun, mi tinin an puon chu an hlîp hmawk hmawk a, kai- lâwn chunga chun an phapêk ta seng a, “Jehu chu lal a ni tah,” tiin taw- tawrâwt an mût tah a."
14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;","Chuongchun, Nimsi nau Jeho- saphat naupa Jehu chun Joram chu a phier rûk tah a. (Suria lal Hazael leiin Joram le Israelhai po po chun Ramoth-gilead khuo chu an vêng a;"
15,"but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.","lal Joram ruok chu Suria lal Hazael le an inthawnaa Suria mi- haiin an inhliem kha Jezreel khuoah insukdam dingin a kîr nâwk kha.) Chun, Jehu chun, “Keia tienga ṭhang in ni chun Jezreel khuoah hieng thu hi hril dingin tukhawm khuoa in- thawk hi insuoktir naw ro,” a ta."
16,"So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.","Chuongchun, Jehu chu tawlai- lîrah a chuong a, Jezreel khuoah a feh a, Joram chu chutaka chun a zâl a na; chun, Juda lal Ahazia khawm Joram chu kan dingin a zu feh a."
17,"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?","Chun, Jezreel kula chun râl- vêng a ngîr a, ama chun Jehu rawi hung chu a hang hmuh a, “Mi tamtak el ka hmuh ie,” a ta. Chun, Joram chun, “Sakawr chung chuong mi anni chu tuok dingin va tir la, ‘Ṭha tieng thu am a nih?’ va ti raw hai seh,” a ta."
18,"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not back.","Chuongchun, mi pakhat sakawr chunga chuong hi a tuok dingin a va feh a, “Lalin hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ṭha tieng thu am a nih?’ tiin” a tih a. Chun, Jehu chun, “Ṭha tieng thu chu nanga lo hriet ding ieng am a um a? Ka hnunga hin va fe ve el rawh,” a tih a. Chun, râlvêngtu chun, “Ei mi tir chun an kuom chu a va tlung ngei a, nisienlakhawm, a hung kîr nâwk ta dêr nawh,” tiin a hril a."
19,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.","Chuongchun, mi pakhat sakawr chunga chuong hi a tir nâwk a, ama khawm chun an kuom a va tlung a, “Lalin hieng ang hin a tih: ‘Ṭha tieng thu am a nih?’ tiin,” a tih a. Chun, Jehuin a dawn a, “Ṭha tieng thu chu nanga lo hriet ding ieng am a um leh? Ka hnunga hin va fe ve el rawh,” a ta."
20,"And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.","Chun, râlvêngtu chun, “Ama khawma an kuom chu a va tlung ngei a, ama khawm chu a hung kîr nâwk ta dêr nawh; chun, a khal dân khawm saw Nimsi naupa Jehu khal dân chie a nih, mi invêt ang elin a khal hlak a nih,” a ta."
21,"And Joram said, Make ready. And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.","Chun, Joram chun, “Buotsai ta u,” a ta. Chun, a tawlailîr chu an buotsai a. Chun, Israel lal Joram le Juda lal Ahazia chu mâni tawlailîr ve vein an va suok a, Jehu chu tuok dingin an va feh a; Jezreel mi Naboth huonah an va hmuh a."
22,"And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?","Chun, Joramin Jehu a hei hmu chun, “Ṭha tieng thu am a nih, Jehu?” a hei tih a. Chun, ama chun a lo dawn a, “I nu Jezebel hin uiret le dâwi a chîng sûng chu ṭha tieng thu ieng am um thei a ta?” a ta."
23,"And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.","Chun, Joram chun a kei her a, a tlân a, Ahazia kuomah, “Inhlêmna a um a ni hi, Ahazia,” a ta."
24,"And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.","Chun, Jehu chun a thalngul chu a theitâwpin a kuoi a, Joram dâr le dâr inkâra chun a kâp a, thal chu a lungah a lût thleng a, a tawlailîra chun a awp ta rawk a."
25,"Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, Jehovah laid this burden upon him:","Chuongchun, Jehu chun a sipai hotu Bidkar kuomah, “Pawm la Jezreel mi Naboth huon hmunah pei thla rawh, kha hmaa a pa Ahab hnunga ei pahnia ei chuong hmun- khat laia LALPAIN hi phur hi ama chunga ân nghat hrim a ni kha;"
26,"Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith Jehovah; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith Jehovah. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of Jehovah.","LALPAIN, ‘Zâni khan Naboth thisen le a naupasalhai thisen ka hmu ngei annâwm,’ a ti kha; chun, LALPAIN, ‘Hi hmun ngeia hin ka thung ding che a nih,’ a ti nâwk kha. Chuongchun, LALPA thu ang chun pawm la, hi hmuna ngei hin pei thla rawh,” a ta."
27,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot: and they smote him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.","Nisienlakhawm, Juda lal Ahazia chun chu chu a hmu chun, huon in tieng a tlân tah a. Chun, Jehu chun a hnawt a, “Ama khawm tawlailîra khan that nghâl ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, Ibleam khaw kâwl, Gur hang fenaa chun an thawh a. Chun, Megiddo khuoah a tlân lût a, chutaka chun a thi tah a."
28,"And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.","Chun, a mihai chun Jerusalem khuoah tawlailîrin an fepui a, ama thlânah a pi le puhai lai David khawpuiah an phûm tah a."
29,And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.,Ahab naupa Joram kum sâwm le kum khat ân lal kumin Ahazia chu Judahai chungah ân lal ṭan a nih.
30,"And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.","Chun, Jehu chu Jezreel khuo a va lût chun Jezebel chun a lo hriet a; chuongchun, a mithai a lo nâl a, a sam dâm a lo chei a, tukvera hin a lo dâk a."
31,"And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master’s murderer?","Chun, Jehu chu kul kawtkhâra a hung lût lai takin, “Ṭha tieng thu am a ni, nang, mâni puhai thattu, Zimri?” a lo tih a."
32,"And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.","Chun, ama chu tukver tieng ngha chun a hung dâk a, “Tu am ka tienga ṭhanghai chu? Tuhai am?” a ta. Mi tillâk pahni amanih, pathum amani hi ama tieng ngha chun an hung dâk a."
33,"And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.","Chun, ama chun, “Hung the thla ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, an the thlâk a, a thi chun bang le sakawrhai chu a khieng nuol el a; chun, ama chun a lo chîl a."
34,"And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.","Chun, a lût a, a fâkin a dâwn a; “Ṭawngsephurnu kha va ngaiven unla, va phûm ro, lal naunu a ni sih a,” a ta."
35,"And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.","Chun, phûm dingin an va feh a; nisienlakhawm, a luru dâm, a ke bâwr dâm, a kutpha bâwr dâm ngawt naw chu an va hmu ta nawh a."
36,"Wherefore they came back, and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;","Chuongchun, an hung nâwk a, an hung hril a. Chun, ama chun, “Hi hi LALPAIN a siehlaw Tisbe mi Elija hmanga, ‘Jezreel kul bula chun uiin Jezebel sa hi la fâng a ta,"
37,"and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.","Jezebel ruong chu Jezreel khaw kul bulah huona êk ang el la nîng a tih; chuongchun, hi hi Jezebel a ni hi aw, an ti nawna dingin,’ ti thu a hril kha a ni hi,” a ta."
