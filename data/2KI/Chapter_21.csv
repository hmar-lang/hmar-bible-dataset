1,Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hephzibah.,"Manasse chu ân lal ṭantir chun kum sâwm le kum hni mi a nih; Jerusalemah kum sâwmnga le kum nga ân lal a, a nu hming chu Heph- ziba a nih."
2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.","Chun, LALPAIN Israel thlahai hmaa a hnawtsuok tah, hnamhaiin thil tirdakumtak an thaw hlak ang, LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtakhai chu a thaw hlak a."
3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.","A pa Hezekiain a suksiet tah bâwlhmunhai chu a siem ṭha nâwk a; Israel lal Ahab thaw angin Baal mâichâmhai a siem a, Aserahai a siem a, vâna um po po khi a biek a, an rawng a bâwl a."
4,"And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.","LALPAIN, “Jerusalemah ka hming inumtir ka tih,” a tina, LALPA ina chun mâichâmhai a siem a."
5,And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.,LALPA in inhuonna sûng pahnia chun vâna um po pohai ta dingin mâichâm a siem a.
6,"And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practised augury, and used enchantments, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.","Chun, a naupa chu meiah ân lûttir a, aisân dâm a chîng a, dawi dâm a hmang a, khawhri aisân thiem zâwlhai le dawithiemhai a ruoi hlak a; LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw- tak ama suklungsen dingin a thaw hlak a."
7,"And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;","Chun, LALPAIN David le a naupa Solomon kuoma, “Hi in le Jerusalem khuo, Israel chihai po po laia ka ithlanga hin, ka hming chu kumkhuoin inumtir ka ta;"
8,"neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.","thu ka pêk ang po le, ka siehlaw Mosien dân a pêk ang po po kha an pawm phawt chun an pi le puhai ka pêk tah rama inthawkin Israelhai kehai khawm hi inpên suoktir ta bawk naw ning,” a lo ti tah ina chun Asera lim a siem chu a sieh a."
9,But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.,"Nisienlakhawm, an pawm nuom nawh a, LALPAIN Israel thlahai hmaa a hnawt suok tah hnamhai thaw nêk hmana nasa lem thil suksuol dingin Manasse chun mihai a thlêm thlûk hlak a."
10,"And Jehovah spake by his servants the prophets, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN a siehlaw zâwlneihai hmangin thu a hril a,"
11,"Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols;","“Juda lal Manasse hin hieng thil tirdakumtakhai hi a thawh a, a hmaa Amor mihai nêk hmanin a suksuol nasa a, Judahai hi a milimhaiin thil ân suksuoltir leiin:"
12,"therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.","LALPA, Israelhai Pathienin hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ngai ta u, Jerusalem le Juda chunga hin a hre taphawthai na khing hni ṭhâwng khawp thil ṭha naw ka hung in- tlungtir ding a nih."
13,"And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.","Samari inkhina hrui le Ahab sûngkuo dârmûmkhai chu Jerusalem chungah keimar ka tih; chun, miin thlêng a hrûk a, ân let vêl angin Jerusalem chu hrûng ka tih."
14,"And I will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;","Chun, ka rochan a la um sunhai chu pei thlâng ka ta, an hmêlmahai kutah pêng ka ta; an hmêlmahai po po man ding le râllâk ding nîng an tih,"
15,"because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.","an pi le puhai Aigupta rama an hung suoka inthawka vawisûn ni chen hin ka mithmuah thil ṭha naw- tak an thaw a, an mi suklungsen lei hin,’ tiin,” a ta."
16,"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.","LALPA mithmua thil ṭha naw- tak thawa Judahai thil ân suksuoltir a suolna tiem loin, Manasse chun pawi tâwklo thisen nasatakin ân suo bawk a, Jerusalem dung le khang chu a sip a."
17,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Manasse chan- chin danghai a thilthaw po pohai, a thil suksuolhai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
18,"And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Manasse chu a pi le puhai kuoma chun a in a, Uzza huona ama in bul huonah an phûm tah a; chuongchun, a naupa Amon chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
19,Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.,"Amon chu ân lal ṭantir chun kum sâwmhni le kum hni a na; Jerusalema chun kum hni ân lal a; a nu hming chu Mesullemet, Jotba khuoa Haruz naunu a nih."
20,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father.","Chun, a pa Manasse thaw ang bawkin LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
21,"And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:","A pa lampui hraw po po chu a hraw veh a, a pain milim rawng a bâwlhai chu a bâwl veh a, chibai a bûk a;"
22,"and he forsook Jehovah, the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of Jehovah.","chuongchun, LALPA, a pi le puhai Pathien chu a mâksan a, LALPA lampui chu a hraw nawh a."
23,"And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.","Chun, a mihaiin Amon chu an phier rûk a, lal chu ama in ngeia chun an that a."
24,But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.,"Nisienlakhawm, chu rama mihai chun lal Amon phier rutuhai po po chu an sukhlum ve ta vawng a; chu rama mihai chun a naupa Josia chu a aiawin lalah an siem tah a."
25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chun, Amon thilthaw danghai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
26,And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.,"Chun, Uzza huonah ama thlân- ah an phûm a, chun, a naupa Josia chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
