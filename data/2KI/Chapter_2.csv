1,"And it came to pass, when Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.","Chun, LALPA chun Elija chu thli- vira vâna a zuk lâk ding lai chun Elija chu Elisa leh Gilgala inthawk chun an feh a."
2,"And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.","Chun, Elija chun Elisa kuomah, “Hitaka hin lo um hri rawh, ka ngên che hi, LALPA chun Bethel chena fe dingin a mi tir a nih,” a ta. Elisa chun, “LALPA le nang a hringna sâlin ka hril a nih; um san naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta. Chuongchun, Bethela chun an fe thla ve ve tah a."
3,"And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.","Chun, Bethel khuoa zâwlnei nau- pasal umhai chu Elisa kuomah an hung a, a kuomah, “Vawisûn hin i chunga hotu hi LALPAIN a lâk hmangpêk ding che a nih ti i hriet am?” an ta. Chun, ama chun, “Aw ka hriet, lo to ṭawk ṭawk unla,” a ta."
4,"And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.","Chun, Elija chun, “Elisa, hitaka hin lo um phawt rawh, ka ngên che hi, LALPA chun Jeriko chena fe dingin a mi tir sih a,” a ta. Ama chun a kuom- ah, “LALPA hringna le nanga hring- na sâlin ka hril a nih, um san naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta. Chuongchun, Jeriko chen chun an zu fe tah a."
5,"And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.","Chun, Jeriko khuoa zâwlnei nau- pasalhai chu Elisa kuomah an hung a, a kuomah, “Vawisûn hin i chunga hotu hi LALPAIN a lâk hmangpêk ding che a nih ti i hriet am?” an ta. Chun, ama chun, “Aw ka hriet, lo to ṭawk ṭawk unla,” a ta."
6,"And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.","Chun, Elija chun a kuomah, “Hitaka hin lo um rawh, ka ngên che hi, LALPA chun Jordan vadung chena fe dingin a mi tir sih a,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “LALPA hringna le nanga hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, um san naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta. Chuong- chun an pahni chun an fe pei ta a."
7,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.","Chun, zâwlnei naupasalhai mi sâwmnga an fe veh a, hlataka hin an hmazâwnah an ngîr a, anni chu Jordan vadung panga chun an ngîr tah a."
8,"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.","Chun, Elija chun a puon chu a hlîp a, ân têl a, tui chu a vuok tah a, chuongchun, khingtieng khingtieng chun a lo inṭheh a, an pahni chun hnuoi hula chun an fe kai tah a."
9,"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.","Chun, an kai hnung chun Elija chun Elisa kuomah, “I kuoma in- thawka lâk hmang ka ni hma hin, i ta dingin ieng am thawpêk ka ti cheh a, mi hni rawh?” a ta. Chun, Elisa chun, “I thlarau chan lehni hi ka chungah um raw se, ka ngên che hi,” a ta."
10,"And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.","Ama chun, “Thil intaktak i hni a ni chu, iengkhawm ni sienla, i kuoma inthawka lâk hmanga ka um lai i hmu chun, chuong ang chun i chung- ah um a tih, i mi hmu naw ruok chun chuong ang chu ni naw nih,” a ta."
11,"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.","Chun, an fe pei a, an la ṭawng zing laiin, ngai ta, mei sakawr taw- lailîr le mei sakawrhai a hung inlang a, chu chun anni chu an kâra tlain a ṭhe tah a; chun, Elija chu thlivira chun vânah a lâwn tah a."
12,"And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.","Chun, Elisa chun a hmuh a, “Pa, Pa! Israel sakawr tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai!” tiin a khêk a."
13,"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.","Elija puon amaa inthawka hung tla chu a lâk a, a kîr a; Jordan vadung panga chun a ngîr tah a."
14,"And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.","Chun, Elija puon amaa in- thawka tla chu a lâk a, “Elija Pathien LALPA chu khâwlai am a um a?” a tih a, tui chu a vuok a, chuongchun, khingtieng khingtieng chun tui chu an lo inṭhe tah a. Chun, Elisa chu râlkhing chu a kai tah a."
15,"And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.","Chun, zâwlnei naupasalhai Jeriko khuoa umhaiin ama chu an lo hmu nâwk chun, “Elija thlarau kha Elisa chunga hin a um ta ngei el,” an tih a, ama chu tuok dingin an hung suok a, a hmaa chun hnuoi sikin an kûn a, chibai an bûk tâwl a."
16,"And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, tuhin pasal hrât i siehlaw- hai kuoma hin sâwmnga an um a, kan ngên che hi, anni chu tir la i hotupa chu inzawngtir rawh, ama chu LALPA thlarau chun lain, tlâng khaw laia manih, ruom khaw laia manih a lo inthlâk hlau rawi mawh,” an ta. Ama chun, “infetir lo ding,” a ta."
17,"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.","Ama chu inzak khawp raka an phût an phût hnunga chun ama chun, “Tir ta unla,” a ta. Chuongchun, mi sâwmnga chu an tir a, ni thum sûng an zawng a, nisienlakhawm, an hmu zo nawh a."
18,"And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?","Chun, anni chu Jeriko khuoa a la châm sûng chun an hung tlung nâwk a, ama chun an kuomah, “Fe naw ro, ka ti hrim cheu a ni naw am a nih,” a lo tih a."
19,"And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.","Chun, chu khawpuia mihai chun Elisa kuomah, “Ngai ta, kan ngên che hi, hi khaw um dân hi ân hawi hle a, kan pu hin i hmu ve zing a; nisienlakhawm, tui hi a ṭha nawh a, a ram khawm hi a takchang naw a nih,” an ta."
20,"And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Tuiûm thar mi hung lapêk unla, a sûngah chi hung sie ro,” a ta. Chun, an hung lâkpêk tah a."
21,"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.","Chun, tuikhur hnârahai chun a hang feh a, chutaka chun chi chu a phul a, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Hi tui hi ka sukhnik tah a, tuta inthawk chu thina hrim hrim le, takchangnawna po po ka sukbo tah,’ tiin,” a ta."
22,"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.","Chuongchun, Elisa thuhril ang ngei chun tu chen hin tuihai chu sukṭhat an ni tah a."
23,"And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun Bethelah a hang feh a, chun, lampuia a fe lai chun khawpuia inthawk hin naupang chitê tehai chu an hung suok a, ama chu an nuisan a, a kuomah, “Hang fe rawh, nang lusîp kawlpa,” an ta."
24,"And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them.","Chun, a hnungtieng a hei en chun anni chu a hmu tah a, chuong- chun, LALPA hmingin anni chu ṭawngsie ân phur tah a. Chun, ram- hnuoia inthawk chun savawmpui pa- hni an hung suok a, anni laia nau- pang sâwmli le pahni chu an hung sê tah a."
25,"And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun Karmel tlângah a feh a, chutaka inthawk chun Samari ramah a kîr nâwk tah a."
