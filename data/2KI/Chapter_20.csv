1,"In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.","Chuong lai chun Hezekia chu thi ngamin a na a. Chuong- chun, Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai chu a kuomah a hung a, a kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘I sûnghai um dân ding rêl fel rawh; i thi ding a ni sih a; dam suok naw ti nih’ tiin” a ta"
2,"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah, saying,","Chuongchun, bang tieng ngha chun ân let a, LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a."
3,"Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.","“Aw LALPA, i hmaa thutak le lungril ṭha famkim puta ka um hlakzie le, i mithmua thil ṭha ka thaw hlakzie kha hre zing dingin ka hung ngên che a nih,” tiin. Chun, Hezekia chu a ṭap ta ngawi ngawi a."
4,"And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,","Chun, Isai chun khawpui lailung vêl chu a tlung hmain hieng hi a hung na, LALPA thu chu a kuomah a hung tlung a,"
5,"Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of Jehovah.","“Kîr nâwk la, ka mihai hotu Hezekia kuomah hril rawh, ‘LALPA, i pu David Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih: I ṭawngṭaina kha ka hriet a, i mitthli tla khawm ka hmuh a, ngai ta, sukdam ka ti cheh a, ni thum nia chun LALPA inah hang fêng i tih."
6,"And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.","Chun, i dam sûng kumhai hi kum sâwm le kum ngain suksei ka ta; chun, nang le hi khawpui hi Assuria lala inthawk chun sanhim ka tih; chun, keima lei le ka siehlaw David leiin hi khawpui hi hum ka tih, a tih,’ tiin.”"
7,"And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.","Chun, Isai chun, “Theichang ra hlawm khat hung la ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, an hung lâk a, khuoihlia chun a bel a, a hung dam nâwk tah a."
8,"And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of Jehovah the third day?","Chun, Hezekia chun Isai kuom- ah, “LALPAIN mi sukdam a ta, LALPA inah a ni thum niin hang fêng ka tih ti inchikna ieng am nîng a ta?” a ta."
9,"And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?","Isai chun, “LALPAIN a thil hril hi thaw ngei a tih ti, hi hi LALPA kuoma inthawka inchikna chu ning a tih: hlim chu sirbi sâwm chena a hang intâwl am i nuom, sirbi sâwm chena ân tâwl kîr?” a ta."
10,"And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.","Hezekia chun a dawn a, “Hlim chu sirbi sâwm chena a hang intâwl chu a awl êm a, chu chu ni lo e, hlim chu sirbi sâwm chenin intâwl kîr lem raw se,” a ta."
11,"And Isaiah the prophet cried unto Jehovah; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.","Chuongchun, zâwlnei Isai chun LALPA a hang ko a; chun, Ahaz dâr chin hrietnaa hlim inhnuoi ta chu sirbi sâwm chenin a sukkîr nâwk tah a."
12,"At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.","Chuong lai chun Baladan naupa Babulon lal Merodak-baladan chun lekhahai le thilpêk dâm Hezekia a thawn a, Hezekia chu a na ti a hriet leiin."
13,"And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.","Chuongchun, Hezekia chun anni chu a lo lâwm a, a thil hlu siena in po pohai, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, thil riminhnik dâm, hriek hlutak dâm, a râlthuom siena in sûng dâm, a ro umhai po po chu ân entir a; a ina mi le a ram sûnga mi Hezekia chun ân entir naw hrim hrim a um nawh."
14,"Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.","Chuong lai chun zâwlnei Isai chu Hezekia kuoma chun a feh a, a kuomah, “Khahai khan ieng am an hril a? Khâwlaia inthawkin am i kuomah an hung a?” a ta. Chun, Hezekia chun, “Ram hlatak, Babulona inthawka hung an nih,” a ta."
15,"And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.","Chuongchun, ama chun, “I ina hin ieng ieng am an hmuh a?” a ta. Chun, Hezekia chun, “Ka in sûnga um po po chu an hmu vawng a, ka ro laia thil kân entir naw hrim hrim a um nawh,” tiin a dawn a."
16,"And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah.","Chun, Isaiin Hezekia kuoma chun, “LALPA thu hi lo ngai raw khai,"
17,"Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.","‘Ngai ta, i in sûnga um po po le vawisûn ni chena i pi le puhaiin an lo inkhâwl chu Babulon khuoa an fepui nihai la hung tlung a tih; iengkhawm mâksan hrim hrim um naw nih,’ LALPAIN a tih."
18,"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.","‘Chun, i rîla ra, i nei ding, i nauhai ngei laia mi khawm an fepui ding a nih, Babulon lal ina chun mitillâk la nîng an tih,’ a tih,” tiin."
19,"Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?","Chuongchun, Hezekia chun Isai kuomah, “I hril LALPA thu hi a ṭha ie,” a ta. Chun, “Ka dam sûng hin inremna le thutak a um ding phawt chun,” a ti nâwk nghâl a."
20,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Hezekia chanchin danghai, a thilthawtheizie po po dâm, dîl le tuilâkna a siem a, khawpui sûnga tui a lâk lût thu dâm chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
21,And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.,"Chun, Hezekia chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in tah a; chuongchun, a naupa Manasse chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
