1,Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.,"Josia chu ân lal ṭantirin kum riet mi a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwm thum le kum khat ân lal a, a nu hming chu Jedida, Bozkath khuoa Adaia naunu a nih."
2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.","Chun, LALPA mithmuah thil feltak a thaw hlak a, a pa David lampui po po chu a hraw veh a, chang- tienga manih, vawitienga manih a pêtsan nawh a."
3,"And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,","Chun, lal Josia ân lal kum sâwm le kum riet kumin lal chun Mesullam naupa Azalia naupa lekhaziektu Saphan chu a tir a,"
4,"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:","“Thiempu laltak Hilkia kuomah hang fe la, kawtkhâr vêngtuhaiin mihai kuoma an lo lâk khâwm LALPA ina tangka hung sie chu tiem sienla;"
5,"and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of Jehovah, to repair the breaches of the house,","LALPA in bâwltu sinthawtuhai pe raw se; chun, anni chun in sietna siemtu LALPA ina sinthawtuhai pe raw se;"
6,"unto the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.","thingrem siemtuhai, in bâwl- tuhai, in se siemtuhai chun in a sietna lai siemna dingin thing le lung sutsa an inchâwk theina dingin,” tiin LALPA inah a tir a."
7,Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.,"Nisienlakhawm, tangka an pêk chu an enzuipui ta chuong nawh a, ringumtaka an thaw hlak leiin."
8,"And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.","Chun, thiempu laltak Hilkia chun lekhaziektu Saphan kuomah, “LALPA ina dân lekhabu chu ka hmu tah,” a ta. Chun, Hilkia chun lekhabu chu Saphan kuomah a pêk a, ama chun a tiem tah a."
9,"And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lekhaziektu Saphan chu lal kuomah a feh a, lal kuomah thu chu a vân tlun nâwk a, “I mihai chun ina tangka um chu an pêk suok vawng a, LALPA in bâwltu sinthaw- tuhai an pêk vawng tah,” a ta."
10,"And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.","Chun, lekhaziektu Saphan chun, “Thiempu lal tak Hilkia chun lekhabu a mi lo pêk annaw,” tiin lal chu a hril a. Chun, Saphan chun lal hmaa chun a tiem a."
11,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.","Chun, lal chun dân lekhabu thuhai chu a hang hriet chun a puon- hai a keithlêr tah a."
12,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,","Chun, lal chun thiempu Hilkia hai, Saphan naupa Ahikam hai, Mikaia naupa Akbor hai, lekhaziektu Saphan hai, lal mi Asaia hai kuoma chun,"
13,"Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.","“Kei le, mipui le, Juda mihai po po hi hi lekhabu hmua thu chuonga hin LALPA mi va râwnpêk ta u, ei thaw dinga hi lekhabua ziek ang po po hi ei pi le puhaiin an lo zâwm naw leiin ei chungah LALPA lunginsenna chu a ṭal nasa ta êm hi,” a ta."
14,"So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed with her.","Chuongchun, thiempu Hilkia hai, Ahikam hai, Akbor hai, Saphan hai, Asaia hai chu silfên enkawltu Harhas nau Tikva naupa Sallum nuhmei zâwlneinu Hulda kuoma chun an va feh a, an va râwn a. (Ama chu Jerusalem Misneha um a na)."
15,"And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,","Ama chun an kuomah, “LALPA Israelhai Pathienin hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ka kuoma hung tirtu cheu hi hril ro,"
16,"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read.","LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih, Ngai ta, hi hmuna le, a sûnga chêng- hai chunga hin thil ṭha nawtak ka hung intlungtir ding a nih, Juda lal- in lekhabua a thu tiem ang po po kha;"
17,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.","an mi mâksan a, pathien danghai kuomah riminhnik an rawh a, an kutsuoka an mi suklungsen leiin hi hmuna hin ka lunginsenna chu a chawk nasa ding a na, rêm el naw nih."
18,"But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA rawn dinga hung tirtu cheu Juda lal kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril ro: LALPA Israelhai Pathienin hieng ang hin a tih: I thu hriet chungchâng thua chun-"
19,"because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.","hi hmun le a sûnga chênghai hi sukrêm le ṭawngsephurin la um an tih ti thu ka hril kha i lo hriet a, i lungril dâm a hung innêm a, LALPA hmaa inngaitlâwm a, i puonhai i keithlêr a, ka hmaa i ṭap leiin kei khawma i thu chu ka lo hriet a, LALPAIN a tih."
20,"Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.","Chuongchun, ngai ta, i pi le puhai kuomah ṭhuoi ka ti cheh a, thlânah lungmuongtaka ṭhuoiin um i ta, hi hmuna thil ṭha nawtak ka hung intlungtir ding chu i mitin hmu ve naw nih, a tih,’ tiin,” a ta. Chuongchun, thu chu lal kuoma chun an vân tlun nâwk a."
