1,"Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for Jehovah hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.","Chun, Elisa chun a naupa a sukdampêk nuhmei kuoma chun, “Tho la, nang le i sûnghai leh, in um theina hmun hmunah va um hri ro; LALPAIN ṭâm ân tlâktir ding a nih; hi rama hin kum sari sûng zet a tla nghe nghe ding a nih,” tiin a lo hril tah a."
2,"And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chu a tho a, Pathien mi thu ang chun a thawh a, a sûnghai le chun Philistin mihai ram- ah kum sari an va um tah a."
3,"And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.","Chun, kum sari ân vawi hnung chun chu nuhmei chu Philistin mihai rama inthawk chun a kîr nâwk a; a in le lo chu lal kuoma hni dingin a va feh a."
4,"Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.","Chun, lal chun Pathien mi sie- hlaw Gehazi chu, “Elisain thil ropui a thawhai po po mi hang hril ta khai,” tiha a lo biek lai tak a na."
5,"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.","Chun, mi pakhat thi ta hnung a sukdam nâwk thu lal chu a lo hril lai tak chun, ngai ta, a naupa a suk- dampêk nâwk nuhmei chun a in le lo chu lal a hung hni veh a. Chun, Gehazi chun, “Aw laltak ka pu, hi hi a ni hi nuhmei chu, chun, hi hi a nih a naupa Elisain a sukdampêk nâwk chu,” a ta."
6,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.","Chun, lal chun nuhmei chu a hang indawn chun a hril tah a. Chuongchun, lal chun hotu pakhat a ruotpêk a, “A ta po po, a loa thil suok po po chenin, hi ram a suoksana in- thawka tu chena mi hi pe nâwk vawng ro,” a ta."
7,"And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.","Chun, Elisa chu Damaska khuo- ah a feh a, chun, Suria lal Benhadad chu a damnawh a; chuongchun, “Pathien mi hitaka hin a hung,” tiin an hril a."
8,"And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?","Chun, lalin Hazael kuomah, “Lâwmman ding chawi la, Pathien mi chu be dingin va fe rawh, ka natna hi ka ṭha suok nâwk thei ding am LALPA mi lo râwnpêk raw se,” a ta."
9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?","Chuongchun, Hazael chu ama be ding chun a va feh a, lâwmman dingin Damaska khuoa thil ṭha tinrêng sanghâwngsei sâwmli phur a chawi a, a hmaa chun a va ngîr a, “I naupa Benhadad, Suria lalin, ‘Ka na hi ka ṭha suok nâwk ding am?’ ti dingin i kuoma hin a mi hung tir a nih,” a ta."
10,"And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit Jehovah hath showed me that he shall surely die.","Chun, Elisa chun a kuomah, “Fe nâwk ta la, a kuomah, ‘Ṭha suok nâwk mawl i tih, a tih,’ ti rawh, ami- ruokchu, a la thi ngei ding a nih ti chu LALPAIN a mîn hriettir a nih,” a ta."
11,"And he settled his countenance stedfastly upon him, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.","Chuongchun, a ta dinga inzak- um khawp rauin a mel ta zing el a, chun, Pathien mi chu a ṭap tah a."
12,"And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.","Chun, Hazael chun, “Iengdinga ka pu hi a ṭap el am a na?” a ta. Ama chun a dawn a, “Israel thlahai chunga i thil ṭha naw thaw ding chu ka hriet leiin a nih, a kulhai la rawpêk i ta, an tlangvâlhai kâwlhnâmin la that i ta, an nau le têhai chu la pei nâwi i ta, nau vawn lai an nuhmeihai chu i la phirthlêr ding a nih,” a ta."
13,"And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.","Chun, Hazael chun, “Kei i siehlaw ui mei mei hin chuong ang thil nasatak chu hang thaw thei zie am ka nih?” a ta. Chun, Elisa chun a dawn a, “Suria mihai chunga hin i lân lal ding a nih ti LALPAIN a mîn hriettir a nih,” a ta."
14,"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou wouldest surely recover.","Chuongchun, Elisa kuoma inthawk chu a suok a, a pu kuom tieng chun, a fe tah a, ama chun, “Elisa chun ieng am a lo hril cheh a?” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Ṭha suok nawk mawl a tih, tiin a mi hril,” a ta."
15,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.","Chun, a zînga chun puon sâtak a lâk a, tuiah a phûm a, chu chun a hmai chu a lo hup pêk a, a thi tah a; chun Hazael chu a aiawin ân lal tah a."
16,"And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.","Chun, Israel lal Ahab naupa Joram kum nga ân lal kum chun, (chuong lai chun Jehosaphat chu Juda lal a nih), Juda lal Jehosaphat naupa Jehoram chu ân lal ṭan a."
17,Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.,Ân lal ṭan lai chun kum sâwm- thum le kum hni mi a nih; Jerusalem khuoa chun kum riet ro a rêl a.
18,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.","Ahab sûnghai angin, Israel lalhai lampui hraw chu a hraw veh a; Ahab naunu chu nuhmeiin a nei a nih; chuongchun, LALPA mithmua chun thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
19,"Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give unto him a lamp for his children alway.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN a siehlaw David leiin Juda ram chu a suksiet nuom nawh a; a thlahai chena khâwnvar inneitir zing a lo tiem ta sih a."
20,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.","Ama hun lai chun Edomhai chu Judahai chungah an hel a, an chunga lal ding an insiem fâwm a."
21,"Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.","Chuongchun, Joram chu Zair khuoah a tawlailîrhai po po leh a va feh a; chun, zâna chun ân thawk suok a, anni inhuoltu Edom mihai le an tawlailîr chunga hotuhai chu a va thaw tah a; chun, mihai chu an puon in tiengahai an tlân ta vawng a."
22,So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.,"Chuongchun, Edomhai chu tu chen hin Judahai chunga chun an la hel ta zing a nih. Chuong lai vêk chun Libna khuo khawm an lo hel veh a."
23,"And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chun, Joram chanchin danghai le a thilthawhai po po chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
24,"And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Joram chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in tah a, a pi le puhai lai David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a; a naupa Ahazia chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
25,In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.,Israel lal Ahab naupa Joram inlal kum sâwm le kum hni kum chun Juda lal Jehoram naupa Ahazia chu ân lal ṭan a.
26,Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.,"Ahazia chun, ro a rêl ṭan lai chun kum sâwmhni le kum hni mi a nih; chun, Jerusalem khuoa chun kum khat ro a rêl a. A nu hming chu Athalia, Israel lal Omri naunu a nih."
27,"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.","Ahab sûnghai lampui hraw chu a hraw veh a, Ahab sûnghai angin LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak; Ahab sûnghai mâkpa a ni sih a."
28,And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.,"Ama chu Ahab naupa Joramin Ramoth-gilead khuoa Suria lal Hazael a hang thawnaa chun a ṭhang veh a; chun, Suria mihai chun Joram chu an lo inhliem a."
29,"And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.","Chun, lal Joram chu Suria lal Hazael an thawnaa Suria mihaiin Rama khuoa an lo inhliem chu Jezreel khuoah insukdam dingin a kîr nâwk tah a. Chun, Juda lal Jehoram naupa Ahazia chu Ahab naupa Joram a nat lei chun kan dingin Jezreel khuoa chun a zu feh a."
