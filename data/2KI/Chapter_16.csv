1,In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.,Remalia naupa Peka kum sâwm le kum sari ân lal kum chun Juda lal Jotham naupa Ahaz chu ân lal ṭan a.
2,"Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God, like David his father.","Ahaz chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwmhni mi a nih; chun, Jerusalem- ah kum sâwm le kum ruk ân lal a. A pu David angin LALPA a Pathien mithmuah thil ṭhatak a thaw ve nawh a."
3,"But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel.","Israel lalhai lampui hraw chu a hraw veh a, anih, LALPAIN Israel thlahai hmaa a hnawtsuok hnam- haiin thil tirdakumtak an thaw hlak angin a naupa chu meiah ân lûttir a."
4,"And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.","Chun, bâwlhmunahai, tlângahai, thing hring hmun tin hnuoia dâm ân thâwi a, riminhnik a rawh a."
5,"Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.","Chuongchun, Suria lal Rezin le Israel lal Remalia naupa Peka chu Jerusalem thaw dingin an hang feh a; Ahaz chu an hang inhuol a, nisien- lakhawm, an hne thei nawh a."
6,"At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there, unto this day.","Chuong lai chun Suria lal Rezin chun Elath khuo chu Suria rama dingin a lâk nâwk a, Judahai chu Elath khuoa inthawk chun a hnawt- suok a; chun, Suria mihai chun Elath khuo chu an va hluo a, tu chen hin an la um zing a nih."
7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.","Chuongchun, Ahaz chun Assuria lal Tiglath-pileser kuomah, “I siehlaw le i naupa ka ni annâwm, a mi thaw dinga hung inthawk, Suria lal kuta inthawk le Israel lal kuta inthawk hin mi hang sansuok ta khai,” tiin mi a tir a."
8,"And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.","Chun, Ahaz chun LALPA ina tangka le rângkachak um taphawt chu lal ina ro siekhâwmnaa mi leh a lâk a, Assuria lal kuomah lâwmman dingin a thawn a."
9,"And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.","Chun, Assuria lal chun a thuhril chu a lo zâwm a; chuongchun, Assuria lal chun Damaska khuo chu a hang thawh a, a lâk a, a mihai chu Kir ramah salah a ṭhuoi a, Rezin chu a that a."
10,"And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.","Chun, lal Ahaz chu Assuria lal Tiglath-pileser be dingin Damaska khuoah a feh a, Damaska khuoa mâichâm chu a va hmuh a; chuong- chun, lal Ahaz chun chu mâichâm lim le an siem dân ang chiea enkhi dingin thiempu Urija kuomah ân phur a."
11,"And Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.","Chun, thiempu Urija chun mâi- châm a hang siem a; lal Ahazin Damaska khuoa inthawka a thawn ang chie chun thiempu Urija chun Damaska khuoa inthawka lal Ahaz hung hma chun a lo siem hman diem a."
12,"And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near unto the altar, and offered thereon.","Chun, Damaska khuoa in- thawka lal a hung tlung chun lal chun mâichâm chu a hei hmuh a; chun, lal chun mâichâm chu a pan hnai a, a hang lâwn a."
13,"And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar.","Chun, mâichâma chun a pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai rawin a beiphit thilinhlânhai chu ân hlân a; a dâwn ding thilinhlân chu a buok a, ân remna thilinhlân thisen chu a the bawk a."
14,"And the brazen altar, which was before Jehovah, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah, and put it on the north side of his altar.","Chun, LALPA hmaa dâr mâi- châm, a mâichâm le LALPA in inkâra mi, in hmazâwna mi chu a lâk sawn a, a mâichâm hmâr tieng panga chun a sie tah a."
15,"And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the king’s burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: but the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.","Chun, lal Ahaz chun, “Mâichâm lientaka hin zingtienga pumraw- hmang thilinhlânhai, zântienga bei- phit thilinhlân dâm, lal pumraw- hmang thilinhlân dâm, a beiphit thilinhlân dâm, a ram mipui po po pumrawhmang thilinhlân dâm, an beiphit thilinhlân dâm, an dâwn ding thilinhlân dâm le hin inhlânin raw la; chun, a chunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân thisen po po le, inthâwina thisen po po chu the rawh, dâr mâichâm ruok chu ka biekna ding ning a ta,” tiin thiempu Urija chu thu a pêk a."
16,"Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.","Chuongchun, thiempu Urija chun lal Ahaz thupêk ang po po chun a thaw tah a."
17,"And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone.","Chun, lal Ahaz chun inṭhutna khurhai chu a suksiet a, insâwpna bêl chu a sie sawn a; ân ṭhutna dâr bâwngchalhaia inthawk dâm chun tuizêng chu a lâk thlâk a, lungrem chungah ân ṭhut a."
18,"And the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he unto the house of Jehovah, because of the king of Assyria.","Chun, châwl nia dinga chung neia lampui ina an siem le tuoltienga lal lûtna chu Assuria lal lei chun LALPA in dingin a thlâkthleng ta hlau a."
19,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Ahaz thilthaw chanchin danghai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
20,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Ahaz chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in a; a pi le puhai lai David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a; chun, a naupa Hezekia chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
