1,In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.,"Jehu kum sari ân lal kum chun Jehoas chu ân lal ṭan a; Jerusalem khuoah kum sâwmli ân lal a; a nu hming chu Zibia, Beer-seba khuoa mi a nih."
2,And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.,"Chun, thiempu Jehoiadain Je- hoas chu ân chûktir sûng po chu LALPA mithmua thil ṭha a thaw hlak a."
3,Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.,"Amiruokchu, bâwlhmunhai chu sukbohmang a ni chuong nawh; bâwl- hmunahai chun mihai chu an inthâwiin riminhnik an la raw zing tho a."
4,"And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it cometh into any man’s heart to bring into the house of Jehovah,","Chun, Jehoas chun thiempuhai kuomah, “LALPA ina lâklût, thil ser intlanna sum po po tiem sa tahai laia fe taphawthai ta dinga tuk, an hring- na intlanna sum dâm, tukhawma LALPA ina lâk lût an phal sum po pohai chu,"
5,"let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.","thiempuhaiin an hmêlhriethaia inthawkin lo la seng hai sienla, chuongchun, in sie, a sietna lai lai siem raw se,” a ta."
6,"But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.","Nisienlakhawm, lal Jehoas chu kum sâwmhni le kum thum ân lal hnung khawmin thiempuhai chun in sie chu an la siem naw rawp a."
7,"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore take no more money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.","Chuongchun, lal Jehoas chun thiempu Jehoiada le thiempu dang- hai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Ieng- dinga in sietna laihai hi in siem naw am? Tuhin chu in hmêlhriethai laia inthawkin tangka chu la ta naw unla, in se siemna dingin pe suok lem ta ro,” a ta."
8,"And the priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.","Chun, thiempuhai chun mihai kuoma inthawka tangka lâk ta lo le, in sietna lai siemtu ni lo chu an remtih a."
9,"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of Jehovah: and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, thiempu Jehoiada chun bâwm a lâk a, a sîn a verpawp a, LALPA ina lût changtieng panga, mâichâm bula chun ân ṭhut a, chu- taka chun LALPA ina tangka hung lâklût po po chu kawtkhâr vêngtu thiempuhai chun an lo sie pei a."
10,"And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, bâwma chun tangka a tam ta hle ti an hriet po leh lal lekhaziektu le thiempu laltak chu an hang feh a, an fûn a, LALPA ina tangka um zât chu an tiem a."
11,"And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of Jehovah,","Chun, an tangka tiem chu sinthawhai, LALPA in bâwltuhai chunga hotuhai chu an pêk a; anni chun LALPA in bâwltu, themthiem- hai le in bâwltuhai hlawa dâm, lung suttuhai le, lung cho suoktuhai hlawa dâm;"
12,"and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.","LALPA in sietna lai siemna ding thinghai le lung sutnaa dâm, in siemna dinga a pawimawnaa pohai chun an hmang hlak a."
13,"But there were not made for the house of Jehovah cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah;","Amiruokchu, LALPA in sûnga an tangka hung lâk chun LALPA in ta dinga tangkaruo nohai, khâwnvar puon chepnahai, maihûnhai, tawtaw- râwthai, rângkachak bûr le bêlhai, tangkaruo bûr le bêlhai an siem nawh a;"
14,"for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of Jehovah.",sinthawtuhai an pêk hlak a; LALPA in siemna dingin an hmang lem a nih.
15,"Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully.","Chun, sinthawtuhai an pêk dinga tangka an inkawltirhai khawm kha an enzuipui chuong nawh a, anni chun ringumtakin an thaw hlak sih a."
16,"The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it was the priests’.","Bawsietna inthâwina thilin- hlân tangka le, suol inthâwina thilin- hlân tangkahai chu LALPA ina chun a lâklût nawh; thiempuhai chanpuol a nih."
17,"Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.","Chun, Suria lal Hazael chun Gath khuo a hang rûn a, a hang lâk a; chun, Hazael chu Jerusalema fe pei a tum a."
18,"And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.","Chun, Juda lal Jehoas chun Juda lal a puhai Jehosaphat hai dâm, Jehoram hai dâm, Ahazia hai dâm, lo inhlân tah thil serhai po po le, ama thil serhai le LALPA ina mi le lal ina ro siekhâwmnaa mi rângkachak um po pohai chu a lâk vawng a; Suria lal Hazael chu a thawn a; chuongchun, Jerusalem chu a nghatsan nâwk tah a."
19,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Joas chanchin danghai, a thilthawhai po po chu Juda lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
20,"And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goeth down to Silla.","Chun, a mihai chu an tho a, ama an phier rûk a, Joas chu Silla pan thlâkna lampuiah Millo inah an thawh a, an sukhlum a."
21,"For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.","Ama mi Shimeath naupa Zozakar le Somer naupa Jehozabad chun an that a nih; chuongchun, a pi le puhai lai David khawpuia chun an phûm a; chun, a naupa Amazia chu a aiawin ân lal tah a."
