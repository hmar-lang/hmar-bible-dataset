1,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.","Chun, ân lal kum kuo kum, thla sâwmna, ni sâwm ni takin Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chun a sipaihai po po leh Jerusalem khuo chu an hang thawh a, umhmun an hang khuor a; chun, kulin an inhuol vêl tah a."
2,So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.,"Chuongchun, lal Zedekia inlal kum sâwm le kum khatna chenin khuo chu an inhuol a."
3,"On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.","Thla lina, ni kuo ni chun khuo chu an ṭâm ta êm êm el a, chutaka mihai ta ding chun fâk ding hrim hrim a um ta nawh a."
4,"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and the king went by the way of the Arabah.","Chun, khawpui kul chu a suk- âwng a; chuongchun, zânah indo mi po po chu lal huon bul, kul bang pahni inkâra kul kawtkhârah an tlânse ta vawng a: (Kaldaihai chun khuo chu an inhuol vêl a nih:) chun, lal chu Araba lampui tieng a feh a."
5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.","Nisienlakhawm, Kaldai sipaihai chun lal chu an hnawt a, Jeriko phaiah an hnawt phâk a; a sipaihai po po chun an tlândarsan ta vawng a."
6,"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.","Chuongchun, lal chu an man a, Babulon lal kuomah Ribla khuoah an ṭhuoi a; chun, a chungchâng an rêl a."
7,"And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.","Chun, Zedekia naupasalhai chu a mithmu ngeiah an that a, Zedekia mithai chu an khel dawk a, kawl an inbun a, Babulonah an fepui tah a."
8,"Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, Babulon lal, lal Nebukadnezzar inlal kum sâwm le kum kuona, thla ngana, ni sari ni chun Babulon lal mi, vêngtu pâwl hotu Nebuzar-adan chu Jerusalemah a lût a;"
9,"And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.","LALPA in le lal in chu a rawh a; Jerusalem in po po, in ropui taktak- hai chu a rawh a."
10,"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.","Chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu kuoma um Kaldai sipaihai po po chun Jerusalem vêla kul chu an sukchim vawng a."
11,"And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.","Chun, khawpui sûnga mi la um, inpehai, mipui la umhai chu vêngtu pâwl hotu Nebuzar-adan chun salah a ṭhuoi vawng a."
12,But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.,Chu rama pasie siehai ruok chu vêngtu pâwl hotu chun grêphrui en- kawltu ding le lo neitu dingin a mâksan a.
13,"And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.","LALPA ina dâr banhai le, LALPA ina inṭhutna le dâr tuizêng chu Kaldaihai chun an sukkawi vawng a, a dârhai chu Babulon tieng an fepui a."
14,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.","Chun, bêlhai dâm, vutluohai dâm, khâwnvar enkawlna thilhai dâm, haihâwhai le dâr bûr le bêlhai po po, rawngbâwlna dinga an hmang- hai chu an lâk a."
15,"And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.","Chun, meilâknahai le maihûn- hai le chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun rângkachaka siemhai chu a rângka- chak chu a lâk a, tangkaruoa siemhai chu a tangkaruo chu a lâk a."
16,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.",Solomonin LALPA in dinga a siem ban pahni le dâr tuizêng le inṭhutnahai chu; chuong hmang- ruohai po poa dâr bûk zât chu hriet ruol a ni nawh.
17,"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with network.","Ban pakhat insâng tieng chu tawng sâwm le tawng riet a na, a sîpa chun dâr sungbâwk a um a; chu bâwk insâng tieng chu tawng thum a nih; a bâwk vêla chun ṭiel chikchek le theibufai lim a chuong a, dâr vawng a nih; chuong ang bawk chun ban pakhat khawm chu ṭiel chikchek a nih."
18,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:","Chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun thiempu lal Seraia le a dawttu Zephania le kawtkhâr vêngtu pa- thum a man a,"
19,"and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city.","chun, indo mihai chunga hotu pakhat leh, lal hmêl hmu phâk hlak, khawpui sûnga la um panga leh, mipuihai hming ziektu sipai hotu lekhaziektu leh, khawpui sûnga la um chu rama mi sâwmruk leh khawpui sûnga chun a man bawk a."
20,"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.","Chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu Nebu- zar-adan chun a ṭhuoi a, Babulon lal kuomah, Ribla khuoa chun a fepui a,"
21,"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.","Chun, Babulon lal chun Ha- math ram, Ribla khuoa chun a lo sukhlum a. Chuongchun, Juda chu a ram sûnga inthawka sala ṭhuoi suokin a lo um tah a."
22,"And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.","Chun, Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzar chun Judai rama mâksana umhai khawm chu an chunga chun Saphan naupa Ahikam naupa Gedalia chu awptu dingin a siem a."
23,"Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.","Chuongchun, sipai pâwl hotu- hai po po le an rawihaiin Babulon lalin Gedalia chu awptu dingin a siem ti an hriet chun Mizpa khuoah Gedalia kuomah an feh a; chuonghai chu Nethania naupa Ismael hai, Karea naupa Johanan hai, Neto- phath mi Tanhumeth naupa Seraia hai, Maaka mi naupa Jaazania hai, an rawihai leh an nih."
24,"And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.","Chun, Gedalia chun chuonghai le, an rawihai kuoma chun ṭawng ân khâm a, an kuomah, “Kaldaihai siehlawa um hi ṭi naw ro; hi rama hin um zing el unla, Babulon lal thu hnuoiah um ro, chuongchun, in ta dingin ṭhâng a tih,” a ta."
25,"But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.","Nisienlakhawm, thla sarinaa chun lal thla, Elisama naupa, Netha- nia naupa Ismael chu mi sâwm ṭhuoiin a feh a, Gedalia chu Mizpa khuoah Judahai le Kaldaihai a kuoma umhai le chun an thawh a, an that ta vawng a."
26,"And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.","Chuongchun, mi po po a chîn a lienin sipai hotuhai leh an suok a; Aigupta ramah an fe tah a, Kaldaihai chu an ṭi a nih."
27,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;","Chun, Juda lal Jehoiakin sala ân tâng kum sâwmthum le kum sarina, thla sâwm le thla hnina, ni sâwmhni le ni sari niin Babulon lal Evil-merodakin ân lal ṭan kumin Juda lal Jehoiakin chu intângna ina inthawkin a ṭhuoi suok a,"
28,"and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,","a kuomah ṭhatakin thu a hril a, Babulona lalruol um vehai lalṭhung- pha chunga chun a lalṭhungpha chu a sie sâng ta bîk a."
29,and changed his prison garments. And Jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:,"Ân tângna in silfênhai chu a thleng a, a dam sûng po chun a kuomah thlaithlêng a awt ve ta rawp a."
30,"and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.","Chuongchun, a châwmna ding- in a hmu tâwk dingin lalin ni tin, a dam sûng po po chun chanvo a siempêk ta zing a."
