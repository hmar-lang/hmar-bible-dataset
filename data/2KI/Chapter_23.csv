1,"And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.","Chun, lal chun mi a tir a, Judai ram le Jerusalema upahai po po a kuomah an ko khâwm ṭeu a."
2,"And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lal chu Judai rama mi po po leh, Jerusalem khuoa mi po po leh, thiempuhai le zâwlneihai leh, mipui- hai po po le chun, a chîn a lienin LALPA ina chun an hang feh a; chun LALPA ina an lekhabu hmua thu- thlung bua chuong po po chu an na hrieta chun a tiem a."
3,"And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.","Chun, lal chu ban hrûlah a ngîr a, chu lekhabua chuong thuthlung thu chu sukdet dingin lungril po po le thlarau po poa LALPA zui ding le a thupêkhai, a thu inhriettirhai, a thuruothai pawm dingin LALPA hmaa chun thu a thlung a;"
4,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el.","chun, mipui po po khawm chun an thlungpui a. Chun, lalin thiempu laltak Hilkia hai, a dawttu thiempu hai, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu LALPA biek in sûnga Baal le Asera le, vâna thil umhai po po ta dinga siem bûr le bêlhai po po chu la suok vawng dingin thu a pêk a; chuongchun, Jerusalem puotieng Kidron phûlah a rawh a, a vâmhai chu Bethelah a fepui a."
5,"And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.","Chun, milim betuhai thiempu- hai, Juda lalhaiin Judai ram khawpui bâwlhmunahai, Jerusalem vêla rim- inhnik raw dinga an lo ruothai khawm chu ân bântir a; Baal ta ding dâm, nisa ta ding dâm, thla ta ding dâm, arasi ta ding dâm, vâna umhai po po ta dinga riminhnik rawtuhai khawm chu."
6,"And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust thereof upon the graves of the common people.","Chun, LALPA ina Asera chu Jerusalem puotieng, Kidron vadung- ah a lâk suok a, Kidron vadunga chun a rawh a, a sir nawi dap a, a nawi chu mi narânhai thlânah a theh a."
7,"And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.","Chun, Asera puon khâwngtuhai nuhmei umna LALPA ina pasal in- zawrhai umna in chu a ṭhiekpêk a."
8,"And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he brake down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.","Chun, Juda khawpuihaia in- thawk chun thiempu po po a ṭhuoi suok a, thiempuhai riminhnik rawna bâwlhmunhai chu Gebaa inthawka Beer-seba chenin a sukbohmang vawng a; khawpui kawtkhâr lûta vawitieng panga, khawpui awptu Josua kawtkhâr lûta kawtkhârhaia bâwlhmunhai chu a sukchim a."
9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren.","Bâwlhmun thiempuhai chu Jerusalema LALPA mâichâmah an hang fe ve naw a chu, an unauhai lai chun bei chawl ṭhanglo chu an fâk ve hlak a."
10,"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.","Chun, tukhawma an naunu amanih, an naupa amanih Molek puola meia an inlûttir ta nawna ding- in Hinnom thlahai ruoma Topheth chu a sukbo ta bawk a."
11,"And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.","Chun, LALPA in lûtnaa a in inhuonna sûnga lal in vêngtu Nathan-melek pindan bula Juda lal- haiin nisa ta dinga sakawr an pêkhai chu a sawn hmang vawng a; nisa tawlailîrhai chu a rawh a."
12,"And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, did the king break down, and beat them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.","Chun, Ahaz in sâwng chunga Juda lalhaiin mâichâm an siemhai le Manassein LALPA in inhuonna tuol sûnglai pahnia mâichâm a siemhai chu lal chun a sukchim a, a suknâwi vawng a, a nâwihai chu Kidron va- dungah a pei a."
13,"And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.","Chun, Jerusalem bul sietna tlâng changtieng panga Zidonhai pa- thien tirdakumtak Astoreth ta ding dâm, Moabhai pathien tirdakumtak Kemos ta ding dâm, Ammon thlahai pathien tirdakumtak Milkom ta ding dâm, Israel lal Solomonin bâwlhmun a siemhai chu lal chun a sukbo vawng a."
14,"And he brake in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.","Chun, lungphunhai chu a suk- nâwi vawng a, Aserahai chu a phûrthlûk a, chuong hmunhaia chun mihriem ru a sie tah a."
15,"Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he brake down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.","Chu naw khawm chu Israelhai thil insuksuoltirtu Nebat naupa Jero- boamin Bethela mâichâm le bâwl- hmun a siem chu, chu mâichâm le bâwlhmun chen khawm chun a sukchim bawk a; chuongchun, bâwl- hmun chu a rawh a, a sir nâwi dap a, Asera chu a raw tah a."
16,"And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.","Chun, Josia chu a hei nghah a, tlânga thlânhai chu a hei hmuh a; chuongchun, thlâna ruhai chu a vân lâktir a, chuong thu lo hriltu Pathien miin a lo hril, LALPA thu ang ngeiin mâichâma chun a rawh a, a suksiet tah a."
17,"Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.","Chun, ama chun, “Saw ka hmu saw tu lungphûm am a nih a?” a ta. Khuoa mihai chun, “Pathien mi, Judai rama inthawka hung, Bethela mâichâm chunga i thilthawhai lo hrillâwktu thlân a ni saw,” an ta."
18,"And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.","Ama chun, “Tukhawma ieng- khawm law naw ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, tukhawma a ruhai chu Samari rama inthawka zâwlnei hung ruhai le chun iengkhawm an law nawh a."
19,"And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Jehovah to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.","Chun, Israel lalhaiin LALPA suklungsena an bâwl Samari ram khuohaia bâwlhmun inhai po po khawm chu Josia chun a sawn hmang a, Bethel khuoa a thaw ang chiein a thawpêk veh a."
20,"And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem.","Chuongchun, chutaka bâwl- hmun thiempu umhai po po chu mâichâm chungah a that a; chuonga chun mihriem ruhai a rawh a, Jerusalemah a kîr nâwk tah a."
21,"And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.","Chun, lalin mi po po kuomah, “Hi thuthlung bua chuong ang hin LALPA in Pathien ta dingin Fekân Ruoiṭhe nei ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
22,"Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;","Israelhai chunga rorêltuhaiin ro an rêl chinah, Israel lalhai inlal sûng po po dâm, Juda lalhai inlal sûng po po khawma chuong angtaka Fekân Ruoiṭhe chu an la nei ngai nawh;"
23,but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem.,lal Josia inlal kum sâwm le kum riet kuma chun chu Fekân Ruoiṭhe chu Jerusalem khuoah LALPA ta dingin an nei ta chau a nih.
24,"Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA ina thiempu Hilkiain a hmu lekhabua dân thu chuonghai kha a sukdet theina dingin khawhri aisânthiem zâwlhai, dawi- thiem dâm, pathien lim dâm, milim dâm, Judai ram le Jerusalema thil tirdakum an hmu hlakhai po po chu Josia chun a sukbo vawng bawk a."
25,"And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.","Mosie dân ang po poa lungril po po le thlarau po po le hrâtna po poa LALPA pawm ama ang hrim hrim a hmaa lal tukhawm an um nawh a, a hnunga khawm ama ang chu tukhawm an um nâwk ta bawk nawh."
26,"Notwithstanding, Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked him.",Chuong sa khawm chun LALPA chun a lunginsenna nasatak Manas- sein a lo suklungsenna po po leia Juda chunga a lunginsenna chawk chu a la sukbo chuong nawh a.
27,"And Jehovah said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.","Chun, LALPAIN, “Israel ka sawn hmang ang hin Juda khawm hi ka hmu phâk loah sawn hmang vêng ka ta, hi khuo ka thlang Jerusalem ngei le, ‘Chutaka chun ka hming chu um a tih,’ ka ti in hi sukbo dai ka tih,” a ta."
28,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Chuongchun, Josia chanchin danghai, a thilthaw po pohai chu Juda lalhai inlal lai chanchin ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
29,"In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh-necoh slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.","Ân lal lai chun Aigupta lal Pharao-Neko chu Assuria lal do dingin Euphrates vadungah a hang feh a; chun, lal Josia chun ama chu a hang thawh a; chun, Pharao-Neko chun ama chu a hmu phingleh Megiddo khuoah a that tah a."
30,"And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead.","Chun, a mihai chun Megiddoa inthawk chun a ruong chu tawlailîrin an fepui a, Jerusalemah an lûtpui a, ama thlânah an phûm tah a. Chuongchun, chu rama mihai chun Josia naupa Jehoahaz chu an ṭhuoi a, hriek an nâl a, a pa aia chun lalah an siem tah a."
31,Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.,"Jehoahaz chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwmhni le kum thum a na; Jerusalemah thla thum ân lal a; a nu hming chu Hamutal, Libna khuoa Jeremia naunu a nih."
32,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.","Chun, a pi le puhai thaw dân ang po po LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
33,"And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.","Chun, Pharao-Neko chun Jeru- salema rorêl thei ta lo dingin Hamath rama Ribla khuoah ân tângtir a; chun, an ram chu tangka talent za khat le rângkachak talent khat ân chawitir a."
34,"And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.","Chun, Pharao-Neko chun Josia nau Eliakim chu a pa Josia aia chun ân laltir a, a hming chu Jehoiakim tiin a thlengpêk a; Jehoahaz ruok chu a ṭhuoi dai a; Aigupta ramah a feh a, chutaka chun a thi tah a."
35,"And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-necoh.","Chun, Jehoiakim chun tangka le rângkachak chu Pharao chu a pêk phawt a, an ramhai chu Pharao thupêk angin a tangka pe dingin sie ân chawitir ve thung a; Pharao-Neko kuoma pêk dingin mi tin chawi ding tuk zât ang peiin chu rama mihai ta tangka le rângkachak ân chawitir a."
36,Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.,"Jehoiakim chu ân lal ṭantirin kum sâwmhni le kum nga a na; Jerusalemah kum sâwm le kum khat ân lal a; a nu hming chu Zebida, Ruma khuoa Pedaia naunu a nih."
37,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.","Chun, a pi le puhai thaw dân ang po po LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a."
