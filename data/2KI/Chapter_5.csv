1,"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory unto Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.","Chun, Suria ram lal sipai hotu Naaman chu LALPAIN Suria mihai sanhimna dinga a lo hmang hlak leiin a hotupa ngaia chun mi ropuitak le inzaumtak el a na, ama chu mi huoisen hrâttak a ni bawk a, nisienlakhawm, ama chu inphâr a ni tlat el a."
2,"And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.","Chun, Suria mihai chu a pâwl pâwlin râl an rêl a, Israel rama in- thawkin sal nuhmeitê pakhat hi an hung ṭhuoi a; ama chun Naaman nuhmei rawng chu a bâwl hlak a."
3,"And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.","Chun, a hotunu kuoma chun, “Ka pu hi Samari rama zâwlnei hmaa khan Pathien chun inumtir sien chu aw, ama chun ân phârna hi a sukdam el ding bah,” a ti hlak a."
4,"And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden that is of the land of Israel.","Chun, Naaman chu a va lût a, “Israel rama nuhmeite khan, chuong- chun, khâng khan a tih,” tiin a pu chu a va hril tah a."
5,"And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.","Chun, Suria ram lal chun, “Va fe luo ta khai, Israel lal kuoma chun lekha thawn ka tih,” a ta. Chun, tangka talent sâwm le rângkachak tlang sâng ruk le silfên tuok sâwm leh a chawi a, a fe tah a."
6,"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.","Chun, lekhathawn chu Israel lal kuoma chun a hung chawi a, “Hi lekhathawn hi lo hmu ngei i ta, ngai ta, ka siehlaw Naaman ân phârna, sukdam dingin i kuomah ka hung tir a nih,” tiin a hril a."
7,"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.","Chun, Israel lal chun lekha- thawn chu a tiem phingleh, a puonhai a keithlêr a, “Hi mipa hin mi ân phârna sukdam dinga ka kuoma a hung tir hi sukdam ding le sukhlum dingin Pathien am ka nih? amiruok- chu, ngaituo ta u, ka ngên cheu hi, keia chunga insêlna a zawngzie hi en ta u,” a ta."
8,"And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, Elisa Pathien mi chun Israel lal chun a puonhai a keithlêr ti a hriet phingleh lal kuoma chun mi a tir a, “Iengdinga i puonhai i keithlêr am a na? tuhin ama chu ka kuomah inhungtir la, chuongchun, Israel rama hin zâwlnei a um ti hrieng a tih,” a ta."
9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.","Chuongchun, Naaman chu a sakawrhai le a sakawr tawlailîrhai leh a va feh a, Elisa in kawtkhâr bula chun a ngîr a."
10,"And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.","Chun, Elisa chun tirtâwn a tir a, “Fe la, Jordan vadungah vawi sari insil la, chun, i taksa chu a pâng- ngai hung nîng a ta, hung fai i tih,” a ta."
11,"But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.","Nisienlakhawm, Naaman chu a lunginsen a, a fe hmang tah a, “Ngai ta u, ka kuoma hung suokin hung ngîr a ta, Pathien LALPA hming chu lamin a kut chu phar vêlin ân phârna lai chu a sukdam ding rawi am ka sawn a;"
12,"Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.","Damaska vadung hieng Abana le Pharpar hai hi Israel rama vadunghai nêk chun a ṭha lem a ni naw am a nih? Chuonga hai chun insilin kân thieng el thei naw am a nih?” a ta. Chuongchun, a ngha kîr a, lunginsenin a fe hmang tah a."
13,"And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?","Chun, a siehlawhai chu an hung hnai a, a kuomah, “Pa, zâwlnei chun thil khirkhântak thaw dingin tir sienla che, i thaw naw ding am a nih? ‘Insil la, lo inthieng ta rawh,’ a ti kha ti âwmtak hrim a ni naw am a nih?” an ta."
14,"Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.","Chun, a zu feh a, Pathien mi hril ang chun Jordan vadunga chun vawi sari a zûn phûm a; a taksa chu naupang chitê pang angin a hung um tah a, a hung inthieng vawng tah a."
15,"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.","Chun, Pathien mi kuoma chun ama le a ruolhai po po leh an hung kîr nâwk a, a hmaa chun a ngîr a; ama chun, “Tuhin ngai ta, hnuoi chung po poah, Israel rama chau naw hin chu Pathien a um nawh ti ka hriet tah; chuleiin, tuhin ka ngên che a nih, i siehlaw thilpêk hi la rawh,” a ta."
16,"But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “A hmaa ka ngîrna hlak, LALPA hming sâlin ka hril a nih, iengkhawm la naw ning,” a ta. Chun, la dingin a ti ṭâl a, nisienlakhawm, a sêl tlat a."
17,"And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto Jehovah.","Chun, Naaman chun, “Chuong a ni naw leh, ka hni che hi, i siehlaw hi sabengtung lien chi phur hni pil mîn lâktir rawh, i siehlaw hin tuta hnung chu LALPA kuoma chau naw chun inthâwina amanih, pumraw- hmang thilinhlân amanih pathien dang kuoma hrim hrim kân hlân ta naw ding a ni sih a."
18,"In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing.","Hi thila hin i siehlaw chu LALPAIN ngaidam raw se, ka pu hi ka kut ringsan a, chibai bûk dinga Rimmon ina a lût a, Rimmon ina ka kûn chun, Rimmon ina ka kûn vena thua chun, LALPAIN i siehlaw hi ngaidam raw se,” a ta."
19,"And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Lungmuongtakin fe rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, a kuoma inthawk chu a suok nâwk a, ieng chen amani chu a fe hman tah a."
20,"But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien mi siehlaw Gehazi chu, “Khâwm, ka pu hin Suria mi Naaman hi a thil hung chawihai hi la loin ân fetir nâwk el a, LALPA hringna sâlin ka hril a nih, va hnawt ka ta, ieng amanih bêk va lapêk ka tih a,” a ta."
21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?","Chuongchun, Gehazi chun Naaman chu a hnawt tah a. Naaman chun tuin amanih a hung hnawt a hei hmu chun lo biek tumin a tawlailîra inthawk chun a ṭum a, “Ṭha tieng thu a ni de maw?” a ta."
22,"And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.","Ama chun, “Ṭha tieng thu nih e. Ka puin ‘Ngai ta, Ephraim tlâng rama inthawkin zâwlneihai naupa- hai laia mi tlangvâl pahniin an mi hung sir ta thut el a, anni chu tangkaruo talent khat le silfên in- thlengna ding pahni pe raw khai,’ tiin a mi hung tir a nih,” a ta."
23,"And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.","Naaman chun, “Talent hni hi la raw khai,” a ta. Chuongchun, la ding chun a thlêm a, tangkaruo talent hni chu silfên inthlengna ding pahni le chun ip pahnia hin a thun a, a siehlawhai pahni chu ân phurtir a, a hmaa chun an fepui tah a."
24,"And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.","Chun, tlâng a va tlung chun a lâkpêk a, in sûnga hin a sieh a; chun, chuonghai chu ân fetir a, an fe tah a."
25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.","Ama ruok chu a va lût a, a pu hmaa chun a va ngîr a. Chun, Elisa chun a kuomah, “Khawtaka in- thawkin am i hung a, Gehazi?” a lo tih a. Ama chun, “I siehlaw hi khâwlai khawm ka fe nawh ie,” a ta."
26,"And he said unto him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “A be ding chea a tawlailîra inthawka mi hung ṭum lai khan ka lungril chu i kuomah a fe ve pei a ni naw am a nih? Tangka dâm, silfên dâm, oliv huon dâm, grêp huon dâm, berâm dâm, sebâwng dâm, suokpa le suoknu dâm hi lâk a hun am a nih?"
27,"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.","Chuongchun, Naaman inphâr- na khan man a ti cheh a, kumkhuoin i thlahai khawm man pei a tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, a kuoma inthawk chun vûr anga vâra inphârin a fe suok tah a."
