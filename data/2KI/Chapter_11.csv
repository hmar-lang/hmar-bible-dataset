1,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.","Chun, Ahazia nu Athalia chun a naupa a thi ti a lo hriet chun, a tho a, lal nauhai po po chu a that vawng a."
2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons that were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain;","Ahazia naupa Joas ruok chu lal Joram naunu, Ahazia farnu Jehoseba chun lal naupasal an thathai laia inthawk chun a ṭhuoi hmang a, a enkawltu leh khum pindanah ân umtir a. Athalia hmu thei lo dingin an thuphmang a; chuongchun, that a ni ve ta nawh a."
3,And he was with her hid in the house of Jehovah six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.,"Chun, ama chu amanu le chun LALPA inah kum ruk an inbihmang a, chuongchun, Athalia chun chu rama chun ro a rêl tah a."
4,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and showed them the king’s son.","Chun, a kum sarinaa chun Jehoiadain Kereth mihai le vêngtu sipaihai laia mi sipai za hotuhai chu ân kotir a, LALPA inah a kuomah ân ṭhuoi lûttir a; chun, an kuomah thu a thlung a, LALPA ina chun ṭawng ân khâmtir a; lal naupa chu ân entir tâwl a."
5,"And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;","Chun, ama chun, “In thaw ding chu hieng ang hi a nih; nangni laia châwlnia hung dinghai hi hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khatin lal in chu vêng in ta;"
6,"and a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.","chun, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu Sur kul kawtkhârah um in ta; chun, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu vêngtuhai hnungtienga kul kawtkhâra chun um in tih; chuong ang chun in chu vêng in ta, a dang- tuah in um ding a nih."
7,"And the two companies of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah about the king.","Chun, nangni laia pâwl hni, châwlnia ṭîn dinghai po po chun lal kâwl vêla LALPA in chu vêng in ta."
8,"And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he goeth out, and when he cometh in.","Chun, mi tinin hriemhrei chawi- in lal chu inhuol vêl in ta; tukhawm huol sûnga hung lût taphawt chu lo that pei ding a nih; chuongchun, lal chu a lût le suok chu zui pei unla,” tiin thu a pêk a."
9,"And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.","Chun, sipai za hotuhai chun thiempu Jehoiada thupêk ang po po chun an thaw vawng a; chun, mâni rawihai seng châwlnia hung dinghai le; châwlnia ṭîn dinghai chu an ṭhuoi a, thiempu Jehoiada kuomah an feh a."
10,"And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David’s, which were in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, thiempu chun sipai za hotuhai chu LALPA ina um, lal David fei le phawhai chu a pêk a."
11,"And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.","Chun, vêngtu sipaihai chun hriemhrei chawi sengin, in chang- tieng panga inthawk vawitieng chen- in, mâichâm le in hrûla chun lal chu an ngîr huol tuou a."
12,"Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king.","Chuongchun, lal naupa chu a hung ṭhuoi suok a, lallukhum ân khumtir a, inhriettirna thu chu a pêk a, lalah an siem a, hriek an nâl a; chun, an kut an ben a, “Pathienin laltak humhim raw se,” an ta."
13,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:","Chun, vêngtu sipaihai le mipuihai ri chu Athaliain a lo hriet chun, LALPA ina mipuihai lai chun a va feh a;"
14,"and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason! treason!","chun, a hang en a, ngai ta, lal chu dân angin ban hrûla hin a lo ngîr a, sipai hotuhai le tawtawrâwt mûttuhai chu lal kâwlah an ngîr a; chun, chu rama mi po po chu an hlim êm êm a, tawtawrâwt dâm an mût an mût a. Chuongchun, Athalia chun a puonhai a keithlêr a, “Phier rûkna! Phier rûkna a ni tah ie,” tiin a khêk a."
15,"And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, thiempu Jehoiada chun sipai chunga hotua ruot sipai za hotuhai chu thu a pêk a, an kuomah, “Sipaihai kâra khan amanu kha in- suoktir ro, tukhawm ama zui ta- phawt chu kâwlhnâma sât hlum ding nîng a tih,” a ta; thiempu chun, “LALPA ina chu that ding a ni nawh,” a lo ti ta sih a."
16,So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house: and there was she slain.,"Chuongchun, lampui an inâwng a; chun, sakawr lûtna lampuiah lal inah a feh a; chutaka chun a nih an that chu."
17,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be Jehovah’s people; between the king also and the people.","Chun, Jehoiada chun LALPA le lal le mipuihai kâra chun LALPA mihai an hung nina dingin thu a thlung tah a; lal le mipuihai kâra khawm chun."
18,"And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.","Chun, chu rama mi po pohai chu Baal inah an feh a, an sukchim a; a mâichâmhai le a limhai chu an suk- nâwi vawng a; Baal thiempu Mattan khawm chu mâichâm bulah an that a. Chun, thiempu chun LALPA in vêngtu hotuhai a ruot a."
19,"And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.","Chun, sipai za hotuhai, Kereth mi dâm, vêngtu sipaihai le, chu rama mi po po chu a ṭhuoi a, LALPA ina inthawkin lal chu an hung ṭhuoi thlâk a, vêngtuhai kawtkhâra lûtin lal ina chun an feh a. Chuongchun, lalhai lalṭhungphaa chun a ṭhung tah a."
20,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king’s house.","Chuongchun, chu rama mi po po chu an lâwm a, chun, khawpui chu buoi loin a um tah a; chun Athalia chu kâwlhnâmin lal inah an that a."
21,Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.,Jehoasin ro a rêl ṭan lai chun kum sari mi a nih.
