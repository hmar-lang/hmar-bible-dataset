1,"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up the sons of Ahab, saying,","Ahab chun Samaria chun nau- pasal sâwmsari a nei a. Chun, Jehu chun Samaria Jezreel khaw hotu, upahai kuoma le Ahab nauhai lo enkawl tleituhai kuoma chun lekha a thawn a."
2,"And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;","“Hi lekha hi in hmu phingleh, in pu nauhai chu in kuoma um an na; tawlailîrhai, sakawrhai, kulpui nei khuohai dâm, râlthuomhai khawm in nei a na;"
3,"look ye out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.","chuongchun, in pu nauhai laia a ṭha tak le a fel tak zawng suok unla, a pa lal ṭhungphaah inṭhungtir unla, in pu sûnghai do chu dopui ro,” tiin."
4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun an ṭi ta êm êm el a, “Ngai ta u, lal pahni khawm khan an hne ta naw a na, einin iengtin am hne thei hlak ei ta?” an ta."
5,"And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.","Chun, lal in sûnga hotu tak dâm, khawpui awptuhai dâm, upahai le naupanghai lo enkawltuhai chun Jehu kuoma chun, “I siehlawhai kan nih, thaw dinga i mi hril ang phawt chun thaw pei kan tih; tukhawm lalah siem naw ning ung ah, nangin ṭha i ti ang angin thaw el rawh,” tiin mi an tir a."
6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.","Chun, an kuomah, “Keia tienga ṭhang in na, ka thu in awi ding chun in pu naupasalhai lu hang la unla, zîngah hieng tik phât hin Jezreelah ka kuomah hung ro,” tiin lekha a thawn nâwk a. Lal naupasalhai chu sâwmsari an na, khawpui mi lienhai, anni enkawl tleituhai kuoma chun an um a."
7,"And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel.","Chun, lekha chu an hmu chun lal naupahai chu an man a, a sâwmsari chun an that a, an luhai chu bâwm- rângah an sieh a, Jezreel khuoah a kuomah an inphur tah a."
8,"And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.","Chun, thangko a hung a, “Lal naupasalhai lu chu an hung lâk tah,” tiin a hril a. Chun, ama chu, “Kul lûtna kawtkhâr bulah hmun hniah intieng khâwm unla, zinga chen um raw se,” a ta."
9,"And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who smote all these?","Chun, a zînga chun a va suok a, a ngîr a, mi po po kuoma chun, “Mi fel in nih; ngai ta u, ka pu chu ka phier rûk a, ka lo sukhlum ta luoh a; anleh, hienghai po po hi tu that am an nih a?"
10,"Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spake concerning the house of Ahab: for Jehovah hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.","LALPA chun Ahab sûnghai chungchâng thu a hril a, LALPA thu chu hnuoi chunga hin luong hmang el naw ni ti hre ro; LALPAIN a siehlaw Elija hmanga a hril kha a hung suktlung a ni ta hi,” a ta."
11,"So Jehu smote all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.","Chuongchun, Jehu chu Jezreel khuoa Ahab sûnghai la um po po le, a mi lienhai po po le, a ruolhai po po le, a thiempuhai chu pakhat khawm hlapêk hlek loin a that fai vawng a."
12,"And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,","Chun, a tho a, a suok a, Sama- riah a fe tah a. Chun, lampuia berâm- puhai berâm hmul vâwna hmun a va tlung chun,"
13,"Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah: and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.","Jehu chun Juda lal Ahazia unauhairawi a hmuh a, “Tuhai am in nih a?” a ta. Anni chun, “Ahazia unauhai kan na, lal nauhai le; lalnu nauhai chibai kan zu bûk ding a nih,” tiin an dawn a."
14,"And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.","Chun, ama chun, “A hringin man tâwl ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, a hringin an man tâwl a, berâm hmul vâwna in khur bula chun an that a, mi sâwmli le pahni zet an nih, pakhat khawm an hla nawh."
15,"And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.","Chun, chutaka inthawka a suok hnung chun Rekab naupa Jehonadab, ama tuok dinga hung a va hmuh a; chuongchun, chibai a bûk a, a kuom- ah, “I chunga lungril indik ka put ang hin lungril indik i put ve am chu?” a ta. Jehonadab chun, “Put e,” tiin a dawn a. “Anleh i kut mi hang pe ta,” a ta. Chuongchun, a kut chu a hang pêk a; chun, ama chun a kuomah a tawlailîr sûngah a kei lût tah a."
16,"And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka kuomah hung ve la, LALPA ta dinga ṭhahnem ka ngaizie hi hang hmu ve hrim ta khai,” a ta. Chuongchun, a tawlailîra chun ân chuongtir ve tah a."
17,"And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake to Elijah.","Chun, Samari a va tlung chun Ahab sûnghai Samaria la um sunhai chu a sukbohmang vawng hmakhat chun a that pei a, Elija kuoma a hril, LALPA thu ang ngei khan."
18,"And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.","Chun, Jehu chun mipuihai po po chu a ko khâwm a, an kuoma chun, “Ahab khan Baal rawng hi a bâwl met chau a na, Jehu ruok hin chu nasa- takin a nih a bâwl ding chu."
19,"Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.","Chuongchun, Baal zâwlneihai po po le a betuhai po po le a thiem- puhai po po ka kuoma hin hung ko khâwm ta u; tukhawm a kim naw um naw raw se, Baal kuoma hin in- thâwina ropuitak inhlân ding ka nei a, tukhawm a kim naw taphawt chu hring dêr naw nih,” a ta. Nisien- lakhawm, Jehu chun Baal betuhai chu sukhlum tumin, var vervêkin a thaw a nih."
20,"And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.","Chun, Jehu chun, “Baal hming- in ruoiṭhena ropui siem ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, chu chu an inthawn vêl tah a."
21,"And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.","Chun, Jehu chun Israel ram po poah a thawn vêl a; chuongchun, Baal betuhai po po chu an hung a, ṭhang naw hrim hrim an um nawh. Chun, Baal ina chun an lût a; chun, Baal in chu kawtkhâra inthawka châwrtieng chenin an sip mup el a."
22,"And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.","Chun, inthuomna puon enkawl- tu kuomah, “Baal betuhai po po hi inthuomna puon hung lapêk ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, inthuomna puonhai chu a hung lâkpêk a."
23,"And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the worshippers of Baal only.","Chun, Jehu chu Rekab naupa Jehonadab le chun Baal inah an lût a, Baal betuhai kuoma chu, “Hitaka hin Baal betuhai ti lo, LALPA mihai lo um ve rawi an tih, zawng unla, en vêl ta u,” a ta."
24,"And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.","Chun, inthâwinahai le pumraw- hmang thilinhlân inhlân dingin an lût a. Jehu chun tuola chun mi sâwm- riet a lo inngîr ta hrim a, “Hieng in kuta ka pêk ta cheu hi tukhawm an suok vai chun, ân suotu chun, a hringna aia chun ama hringna chu chân a tih,” a ta."
25,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu ân hlân zo chun Jehu chun vêngtu sipai le an hotu kuoma chun, “Va lût unla, va that ro, tukhawm insuoktir naw ro,” a ta. Chun, kâwl- hnâmin an sât rak el a; chun, vêngtu sipai le an hotuhai chun an pei suok a; chun, Baal in umna khuoa chun an feh a."
26,"And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.","Chun, Baal ina milimhai chu an lâksuok a, an rawh a."
27,"And they brake down the pillar of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day.","Chun, Baal lungphun chu an sukchim a, Baal in chu an suksiet a, inhnâwmna inah an hmang tah a; tu chen hin an la hmang zing a nih."
28,Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.,Chuong ang chun Jehu chun Baal chu Israel rama chun a suk- bohmang a nih.
29,"Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.","Nisienlakhawm, Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolna-Israelhai thil in- suksuoltira a thawhai chu Jehu chun a bân chuong nawh a; chu chu Bethel khuo le Dan khuoa rângkachak bâwngte lim biek a nih."
30,"And Jehovah said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.","Chun, LALPAIN Jehu kuomah, “Ka mittlungtaka thil i thaw lei le, ka lungril duthusâm angtaka Ahab sûnghai chunga i thaw leiin, i naupa- salhai chu suon li chenin Israel lalṭhungphaah ṭhung an tih,” a ta."
31,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin.","Nisienlakhawm, Jehu chun LALPA, Israelhai Pathien dân chu a lungril po poin a pawm nawh a; Jero- boamin Israelhai thil insuksuoltira a suksuol kha a bân chuong nawh a."
32,In those days Jehovah began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;,"Chuong lai chun LALPA chun Israelhai chu a thlauthlâk ṭan tah a; chuongchun, Hazael chun Israel ram po poa chun a hne pei a;"
33,"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.","Jordana inthawka khawsak tieng, Gilead ram po po, Gadhai le, Reubenhai le, Manassehai dâm, Arnon ruoma Aroera inthawka Gilead le Basan ram tlung rakin."
34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Jehu chanchin danghai, a thil- thaw po pohai, a thilthawtheizie po pohai chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna buah a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
35,And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.,"Chuongchun, Jehu chu a pi le puhai kuoma chun a in tah a, Samari khuoah an phûm tah a. Chun, a naupa Jehoahaz chu ama aiawin ân lal tah a."
36,And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.,Samari rama Israelhai chunga Jehu rorêl sûng chu kum sâwmhni le kum riet a nih.
