1,"And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us.","Chun, zâwlneihai naupasalhai chun Elisa kuomah, “En ta hi, i hmaa kan ṭhung khâwmna hi kan ta dingin ân têp taluoh a."
2,"Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.","Jordan vadungah zu fêng kan ta, chutaka thing chu zu la seng kan ta, kan ṭhung khâwmna ding chutaka chun zu siem kan tih aw?” an ta. Ama chun a dawn a, “Fe ta unla,” a ta."
3,"And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.","Chun, mi pakhat chun, “Lungâwi la, i siehlawhai lai hin fe ve ta la,” a ta. Ama chun, “Fe vêng ka tih,” tiin a dawn a."
4,"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.","Chuongchun, anni lai chun a fe ve tah a. Chun, Jordan vadung an tlung chun thing chu an hei phûr a."
5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.","Chun, mi pakhatin thing a hei phûr lai tak hin, a hreipui chu tuiah a tla tah a; chun, ama chun “E khai, pu, kan haw a ni bah,” tiin a khêk tah a."
6,"And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim.","Chun, Pathien mi chun, “Khâw- lai tak âm a tlah a?” a ta. Ama chun a tlâkna lai ân entir a. Chuongchun, thingtuoi hi a hei sât a, chutaka chun a hei pei lût a, thîr chu a hung inlâng tah a."
7,"And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.","Chun, ama chun, “La raw le,” a ta. Chuongchun, a hei ban a, a lâk tah a."
8,"Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.","Suria lal chun Israelhai chu a hung rûn a, “Chulai hmun khalai hmuna chun inchân ei tiu,” tiin a upahai chu a rawn a."
9,"And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are coming down.","Chun, Pathien mi chun Israel lal kuomah, “Chuong ang hmuna chun fe lo dingin fîmkhur rawh, chutaka chun Suria mihai an hung thla ding a nih,” tiin mi a tir hlak a."
10,"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.","Chun, Israel lal chun Pathien miin a lo hril ta hmun chu a vân enthlittir hlak a; chutaka chun vawi hni vawi khat chau khawm ni loin, a lo inhumhim hlak a."
11,"And the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?","Chuongchun, chu thua chun Suria lal lungril chu a lunginzîng hleh a; chun, a upahai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Eini laia atu hîm Israel lal tienga ṭhang in mi hril nuom naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
12,"And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.","Chun, upahai laia mi pakhat chun, “Tukhawm kan ṭhang nawh ie, pu, aw laltak, Israel rama um zâwlnei Elisa hin i pindan sûngrila i hrilhai hi Israel lal a hril pei a ni lem a nih,” a ta."
13,"And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.","Chun, ama chun, “Khâwlai am a um a, va zawng ta u, inmantir ka tih,” a ta. Chun, “Ngai ta, Dothan khuoah a um,” tiin an hril a."
14,"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.","Chuongchun, sakawr dâm, taw- lailîr dâm, sakawr tamtakhai chu- taka chun a tir a, zânah an va feh a, khuo chu an inhuol ta mup el a."
15,"And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?","Chun, Pathien mi siehlaw chu zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, a va suok chun, ngai ta, sipaihai chun sakawr leh, tawlailîr leh khuo chu an lo inhuol mup el a. Chun, a siehlaw chun a kuomah, “E khai, pu, iengtin am thaw tâng ei ta?” a ta."
16,"And he answered, Fear not; for they that are with us are more than they that are with them.","Chun, ama chun, “Ṭi da ta la, anni tienga ṭhang nêk chun, eini tienga ṭhang an tam lem annâwm,” a ta."
17,"And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.","Chun, Elisa chu a ṭawngṭai a, “LALPA, a hmu theina dingin, a mit hung sukvarpêk ta khai,” a ta. Chun, LALPA chun chu tlangvâl mit chu a hung sukvarpêk a, chuongchun, a hmu ve tah a; chun, ngai ta, Elisa vêla chun tlâng chu mei tawlailîr le sa- kawrin a sip mup el a."
18,"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.","Chun, ama tieng an hung thla chun, Elisa chun LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a, “Hienghai hi an mit hung sukdelpêk tâwl ta,” a ta. Chun, Elisa thu angin an mithai chu a hung sukdelpêk tâwl tah a."
19,"And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.","Chun, Elisa chun an kuomah, “Hi chu lampui a ni nawh a, khuo khawm a ni bawk nawh a; mi zui unla in mi zawngpa kuoma chun ṭhuoi ka ti cheu,” a ta. Chuongchun, Samari khuoa chun a ṭhuoi tah a."
20,"And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.","Chun, Samari khaw sûng an hang tlung chun Elisa chun, “LALPA, hieng hai hin an hmu theina dingin an mithai hung sukvarpêk rawh,” a ta. Chun, LALPAIN an mithai a hung sukvar a, an hmu tah a; chun, ngai ta, Samari khaw sûnga chun an lo um zing el a."
21,"And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?","Chun, Israel lal chun anni chu a hmu chun Elisa kuomah, “Pa, that tâwl ka ti,? That tâwl ka ti?” a ta."
22,"And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.","Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “That lo e, i kâwlhnâm le i thalngula i sal manhai chu i that ding am a nih? Bei le tui hung pe la, fain dâwn hai sienla, an pu kuomah fe nâwk raw hai seh,” a ta."
23,"And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.","Chuongchun, fâk ding nasatak a buotsaipêk a; chun, an fâk a, an dâwn zo chun ân fetir nâwk ta vawng a, an pu kuom tieng an fe nâwk tah a. Chuongchun, Suriahai chu Israel rama chun an fe nâwk ta ngai nawh a."
24,"And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.","Chu hnunga chun Suria lal Benhadad chun a sipai po po a ko khâwm vawng a, Samari khuo a hang inhuol a."
25,"And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.","Chun, Samari khuoa chun ṭâm a nasa êm el a; ngai ta, an inhuol tlat a, sabengtung lu hi tangka sâwm- rietin an zawr a; chun, vaṭhu êk hi kab hmun lia ṭhea hmun khat tangka pangaah an zawr hiel bawk a."
26,"And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.","Chun, Israel lal chu kul kho- tlânga a fe lai hin nuhmei pakhat hin, “Aw laltak ka pu, mi ṭhangpui rawh,” a lo tih a."
27,"And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?","Chun, ama chun, “LALPAIN a ṭhangpui nghâl naw che leh keiin khâwlaia inthawkin am hang ṭhang- pui ka ti cheh a? Hrizâwla inthawk amanih, grêp sâwrna khura in- thawkin amanih a ni ding chu?” a ta."
28,"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ieng am i ti a ni leh?” a ti nâwk a. Chun, ama chun a dawn a. “Hi nuhmei hin ka kuomah, ‘I naupa hi vawisûna ei fâk dingin thaw la, zîngah ka naupa hi ei fâk thung ding annâwm,’ a ta."
29,"So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son.","Chuongchun, ka naupa chu kan suong a, kan fâk tah a; chun, a zînga chun keiin a kuomah, ‘I naupa chu ei fâk dingin thaw ve thung raw leh,’ ka tih a, a naupa chu a thuphmang bîk el tah a nih,” a ta."
30,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes (now he was passing by upon the wall); and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.","Chun, lal chun chu nuhmei thuhril chu a hriet chun a puon a keithlêr tah a, (kul khotlânga a fe lai a nih) chun, mipuihai chun an hang en a, ngai ta, a pang depa chun saiip puon hi a lo sil zing a."
31,"Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.","Chuongchun, ama chun, “Vawi- sûn hin Saphat naupa Elisa chun a lu a la put hrim hrim chun, Pathien chun a law law mi law el raw se, chu nêka nasa hman khawm chun,” a ta."
32,"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him: is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?","Elisa chu a inah a ṭhung a, upahai khawm chu an ṭhung veh a, chun, laltak chun a kuomah mi pakhat a tir a, nisienlakhawm, a mi tir chun a kuom a hung tlung hmain upahai kuoma chun, “Hi tuolthattupa naupa hin ka lu la ve dingin mi a hung tir ti in hriet ve am? To ta u, a mi tir chu a hung tlung phingleh, kawt lo khâr unla, kawtkhâra khan lo dang tlat ro; a hnunga chun a pu kalchawi ri ân hriet a ni nghe nghe naw am a nih?” a ta."
33,"And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?","Chun, chuonga anni a la biek lai mêk chun ngai ta, a mi tir chu a hung tlung thla tah a; chun, laltak chun, “Ngai ta, hi thil ṭha naw hi, LALPA hung tir a ni hi, LALPA chu iengding- in am la nghâk ta rawp ka tih a?” a ta."
