1,"In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.","Juda lal Ahazia naupa Joas kum sâwm hni le kum thum ân lal kum chun Jehu naupa Jehoahaz chu Israelhai chungah Samari khuoa chun ân lal ṭan a, kum sâwm le kum sari ân lal a."
2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.","LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a, Israelhai thil insuksuoltira a thaw Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolnahai kha a chîng veh a, a mâksan nâwk ta hrim hrim nawh a."
3,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, continually.","Chun, LALPA lung chu Israelhai chunga chun a chawk a, chuongchun, Suria lal Hazael kuta le, Hazael naupa Benhadad kuta chun a pêk ta pei a."
4,"And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened unto him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.","Chun, Jehoahaz chun LALPA kuomah a ngên a ngên a; chun, LALPAIN a thu chu a lo ngaipêk a, Israelhai nêksâwra an um a, Suria lalin anni a nêksâwrzie chu a hmu zing sih a."
5,"(And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime.","LALPA chun Israelhai chu san- damtu a pêk a; chuongchun, Suria mihai hnuoia an um chu an suok a, Israel thlahai chu kha hma ang bawk khan anni in tieng an um nâwk ta ṭawk ṭawk a."
6,"Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)","Amiruokchu, Israelhai thil in- suksuoltira a thaw Jeroboam sûnghai suolna kha an mâksan nawh a; an la chîng ta zing lem a; chun, Samari khuoa chun Asera khawm chu a la um zing nghe nghe a."
7,"For he left not to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.","Jehoahaz chu a mihai laia sakawr chung chuong mi sâwmnga le tawlailîr sâwm le, sipai sîng khat ti naw chu nei a phalpêk si nawh a, Suria lal chun a sukbohmang vawng a, pilvut childip ang elin a siem a nih."
8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Chuongchun, Jehoahaz chanchin danghai, a thilthaw po pohai, a thil- thawtheizie dâm chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
9,And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.,"Chun, Jehoahaz chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in tah a; chun, Samari khuoa chun an phûm a; chun, a naupa Joas chu a aiawin ân lal tah a."
10,"In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.",Juda lal Joas kum sâwmthum le kum sari ân lal kum chun Jehoahaz naupa Jehoas chu Israelhai chungah Samari khuoah ân lal ṭan a; kum sâwm le kum ruk ân lal a.
11,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein.","Chun, LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawtak a thaw hlak a; Israel hai thil insuksuoltira a thaw Nebat naupa Jeroboam suolnahai po po kha a mâksan bîk nawh a, a la chîng zing ta lem a."
12,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Chuongchun, Joas chanchin danghai, a thilthaw po pohai dâm, Juda lal Amazia a thaw laia a thil- thawtheizie dâm chu Israel lalhai inlal lai thu ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
13,And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.,"Chun, Joas chu a pi le puhai kuomah a in tah a; chun Jeroboam chu a lal ṭhungphaah a ṭhung a, chun Joas chu Samari khuoah Israel lalhai lai an phûm tah a."
14,"Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!","Chun, Elisa chu a thipui ding natnain a hung na tah a, chuongchun, Israel lal Joas chu a kuomah a zu feh a, a ṭah a, “Pa, Pa, Israelhai tawlailîr le sakawr chung chuong mihai,” a ta;"
15,"And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows; and he took unto him bow and arrows.","Chun, Elisa chun a kuomah “Thalngul le thalhai hung la ta,” a ta; chun, thalngul le thalhai a hung lâk a."
16,"And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow; and he put his hand upon it. And Elisha laid his hands upon the king’s hands.","Chun, Israel lal kuoma chun, “Thalngul kha hang chel ta,” a tih a, chuongchun, a hang chel a. Chun, Elisa chun lal kut chunga chun a kut ân nghat a."
17,"And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Jehovah’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.","Chun, ama chun, “Saktieng tukver hang hawng ta,” a ta, chun, a hang hawng a. Chun, Elisa chun, “Kâp rawh,” a ta, chun, a hang kâp a, chun, ama chun, “LALPA hnena thal, Suriahai hnena thal a ni kha; Aphek khuoa chun Suria mihai chu bo- hmang dêr khawpin i hne ding annâwm,” a ta."
18,"And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground; and he smote thrice, and stayed.","Chun, “Thalhai kha hung la ta,” a ti nâwk a; chuongchun, a hei lâk a. Chun, Israel lal kuoma chun, “Hnuoi kha hei sun ta,” a ta; chuongchun, vawi thum a hei sun a, a ma ta el a."
19,"And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times: then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it; whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.","Chuongchun, Pathien mi chu a chunga chun a lunginsen tah a, “Vawi nga, vawi ruk lai i sun ding i sawnnaw; chuongchun, Suria mihai chu bo- hmang dêr khawpin i hne ding a nih. Amiruokchu, Suria mihai chu vawi thum chau i hne ding a ni ta hi,” a ta."
20,"And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.","Chun, Elisa chu a thih a, an phûm tah a. Chun, kum a hung invawi po hin, Moab mihai chun an ram hi an hung rûn hlak a."
21,"And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.","Chun, mi pakhat an phûm ding lai takin, ngai ta, pâwl pakhat an hei hmuh a; chuongchun, ama chu Elisa thlâna chun an thlâk el tah a; chun, a ruong chun Elisa ruhai chu a zu tâwk phingleh, a hung hring nâwk a, a hung ngîr el tah a."
22,And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.,"Chun, Suria lal Hazael chun Jehoahaz hun sûng chun Israelhai chu a nêksâwr zing a."
23,"But Jehovah was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN Ab- raham kuoma dâm, Isaak kuoma dâm, Jakob kuoma dâm khan thu a thlung leiin anni chu a lunginsiet a, a lainat a, a ngaisak a, anni chu a sukbohmang nuom nawh a, a kuoma inthawk chun a la pei thlâk nuom ta naw rawp a."
24,And Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.,"Chun, Suria lal Hazael chu a thih a, a naupa Benhadad chu ama aiaw chun ân lal tah a."
25,"And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel.","Chun, Jehoahaz naupa Jehoas chun Hazael naupa Benhadadin a pa Jehoahaz a rûn a, khuo a lâkpêkhai kha a lâkpêk nâwk a, Joas chun vawi thum a hneh a, Israel ram khuohai chu a lâk nâwk a."
