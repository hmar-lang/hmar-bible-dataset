2,"And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.","Chun, Ahazia chu Samaria khuoa um a in pindan chunghnung inhuonna dai âwngkâra chun a tlah a, a damnaw tah a; chun, tirtâwnhai a tir a, “Fe unla, Ekronhai Pathien Baal-zebub chu hi natnaa inthawk hin ka dam nâwk ding am va râwn ta u,” tiin."
3,"But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?","Nisienlakhawm, Tisbe mi Elija kuoma chun LALPA vântirkoin, “Tho la, Samari lal tirtâwnhai chu intuokpui dingin fe rawh; chun, an kuoma chun, Israel rama hin Pathien a um ta naw leiin amanih Ekronhai pathien Baal-zebub chu râwn dinga in fe chu?"
4,"Now therefore thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.","Tuhin, LALPA chun hieng hin a ti a nih, ‘Khum, i kainaa inthawk khan hung ṭum nâwk ta ngai dêr naw ti nih a, i thi ngei ngei ding a nih, a tih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a ta. Chun, Elija chu a fe tah a."
5,"And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned?","Chun, mitirhai chu a kuomah an hung kîr nâwk a, an kuomah, “Ieng- tiziea hung kîr nâwk am in nih a?” a lo tih a."
6,"And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Mi pa- khat keini mîn tuokpui dingin a hung a, kan kuomah, ‘Fe unla, kîr nâwk unla, lal a tirtu cheu kuoma chun hieng hin va hril ro, LALPA chun hieng hin a hril a nih, Israel rama hin Pathien a um ta naw leiin am a ni Ekronhai pathien Baal-zebub chu thu indawn dinga mi i tir chu? Chulei- chun, khum i kainaa inthawk khan ṭum nâwk ta naw ti nih a, i thi ngei ngei ding a nih,’ tiin, ti rawh, a tih a,” an ta."
7,"And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?","Chun, an kuoma chun, “Nangni intuokpui dinga hung a, hieng thuhai hung hriltu cheu chu mi ieng ang hrim am a ni leh?” a ta."
8,"And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.","Anni chun, “Ama chu sahmul puon sila, a kâwng chu kâwngkhia inhrên a nih,” an tih a, an dawn a. Chun, ama chun, “Elija, Tisbe mi kha a ni chu,” a ta."
9,"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake unto him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down.","Chun, lal chun sipai sâwmnga pâwl hotu pakhat, a rawihai sâwm- nga le chun a tir tah a, chun, a kuoma chun a hang feh a, ngai ta, tlâng sîpa chun ama chu a lo ṭhung a. Chun, a kuomah, “Aw nang Pathien mi, lal chun, ‘Hung thla raw se,’ a ti che,” a ta."
10,"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.","Chun, Elija chun a dawn a, sipai sâwmnga pâwl hotu kuoma chun, “Pathien mi ka ni chun, vâna in- thawkin mei hung tla thla sienla, nang le i rawihai sâwmnga kha kânghâwp vawng raw se,” a ta. Chun, vâna inthawk chun mei a hung tla thlah a, ama le a rawihai sâwmnga chu a kânghâwp vawng tah a."
11,"And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.","Chun, a kuoma chun sipai sâwmnga pâwl hotu dang le sâwmnga a tir nâwk a. Ama chu a hang feh a, a kuomah, “Aw nang Pathien mi, lal chun, ‘Hung thla raw se,’ a ti che,” a ta."
12,"And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.","Chun, Elija chun a dawn a, an kuomah, “Pathien mi ka ni tak zet chun, vâna inthawkin mei hung tla thla sienla, nang le i rawihai sâwm- nga kha kânghâwp vawng raw se,” a ta. Chun vâna inthawk chun Pathien mei a hung tla thlah a, ama le a rawihai sâwmnga chu a kânghâwp vawng tah a."
13,"And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.","Chun, sipai sâwmnga pâwl hotu le a rawihai sâwmnga ma a tir nâwk a. Chun, sâwmnga pâwl hotu pa- thumna chu a hang feh a, a hung a, Elija hmaa dingṭhaṭhuonin, a ngên a, a kuomah, “Aw Pathien mi, ka ngên che hi, keia hringna le hi i siehlaw sâwmngahai hringna hi i mithmua chun hlutak ni raw se;"
14,"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight.","ngai ta, vâna inthawkin mei a hung tla thla a, kha sâwmnga pâwl hotu pahnihai kha, an rawihai sâwm- ngahai leh a kânghâwp vawng tah a; amiruokchu, tuhin ka hringna chu i mithmua chun hlutak ni raw se,” a tih a."
15,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun Elija kuomah, “Ama kha zui thla la, ama kha ṭi naw rawh,” a ta. Chun, a tho a, ama chu a zui thlâk a, lal kuoma chun a fe tah a."
16,"And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.","Chun, a kuomah, “LALPA chun hieng hin a ti a nih, ‘Ekronhai pa- thien Baal-zebub chu thu indawn dinga tirtâwnhai i lo tir hi, Israel rama hin Pathien rawn ding hrim an um naw lei a ni maw? chuleiin, khum i kainaa inthawk khan ṭum nâwk ta naw ti nih a, i thi ngei ngei ding a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
17,So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.,"Chuongchun, Elijân LALPA thu a hril ang ngei chun ama chu a thi tah a. Chun, naupasal a nei naw leiin Juda lal Jehosaphat naupa Jehoram inlal kum hninaa chun Jehoram chun a aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Chun, Ahazia thilthaw danghai a thaw tahai chu Israel lalhai inlal lai chanchin ziekna bua chun a chuong a ni naw am a nih?"
