1,"Thus saith Jehovah unto me, Go, and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.","LALPA chun ka kuomah hieng hin a tih: “Fe la, puon zai inhmi hrên i ta dingin inchaw la, i kâwngah hrên la, tuia chun sukhu naw rawh,” a ta."
2,"So I bought a girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and put it upon my loins.","Chuongchun, LALPA thu ang chun hrên chu kân châwk a, ka kâwnga chun ka hrên tah a."
3,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying,","Chun, a vawi hninaah LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a;"
4,"Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.","“I kâwnga um hrên închâwk kha la la, tho la, Euphrates vadunga chun fe la, chutaka chun lungpui kuoah va thup rawh,” tiin."
5,"So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.","Chuongchun, ka feh a, Euphrates vadung sîra chun ka thup tah a, LALPAIN thu a mi pêk ang tak chun."
6,"And it came to pass after many days, that Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.","Chun, ni tam tak hnunga chun LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Tho la, Euphrates vadunga khan va fe la, chutaka inthawk chun, thup dinga thu ka pêk che, kha hrên kha va la rawh,” a ta."
7,"Then I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.","Euphrates vadunga chun ka va fe a, ka cho a, ka thupna hmuna in- thawk chun hrên chu ka lâk tah a; chun, ngai ta, hrên chu a lo inek tah a; iengakhawm ṭhangkai a ni ta nawh a."
8,"Then the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a, LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih:"
9,"Thus saith Jehovah, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.","Hieng ang tak hin Juda chapona le, Jerusalem chapona nasatak chu suksieng ka tih."
10,"This evil people, that refuse to hear my words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing.","Hi hnam suol ka thu ngai nuom loa, an lungril ngarna anga fea, an rawng bâwl dinga pathien danghai chu zuia, anni chibai bûktuhai hi hi hrên ienga khawma ṭhangkai ta lo ang hi nîng an tih."
11,"For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they may be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.","Hrên chu mi kâwnga a kawp angin, Juda sûngkuo po po le Israel sûngkuo po po chu keimaa kawp dingin ka lo thaw tah a, LALPA chun a tih: keia ta dinga mihai an nih a, hming an nih a, inpâkna an nih a, ropuina an ni theina dingin, nisien- lakhawm, an ngai si nawh a."
12,"Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?","Chuleiin, an kuoma chun hi thu hi hril i tih: LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Savunpeng tin chu uoina suksip nîng a ta, chun, i kuoma chun, “Savunpeng tin chu uoina suksip nîng a tih, ti hi kan hriet naw a ni maw?” tîng an ta."
13,"Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.","Nang chun an kuoma chun, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, hi ram hluotuhai hi, lalhai David lalṭhungpha chunga ṭhunghai le, thiempuhai le, zâwlneihai le, Jerusa- lem hluotuhai po po chu inruinain ka suksip ding a nih."
14,"And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.","Anni chu inbawtuotir ka ta, pahai le an naupasalhai ngei chu inbawtuong an tih, LALPA chun a tih; lunginsiet naw ning a, hla naw ning a, hmangaina khawm nei naw ning a, anni chu ka sukbohmang nawna dingin, iengkhawmin mi dâl naw ni."
15,"Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud; for Jehovah hath spoken.","Ngai unla, in nahai daw ro; chapo naw ro, LALPA chun a hril ta sih a."
16,"Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.","Tlâng inthimhai chunga in kehai chu ân sui hmain le, inthim ân umtir hma hin LALPA in Pathien chu chawimawina pe ro; chun, a var in zawng lai chun, ama chun thina hlimah ân changtir a, inthim nasatak el chu a siem tah a."
17,"But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Jehovah’s flock is taken captive.","Nisienlakhawm, in ngai naw chun, in chapona lei chun ka thla chu inrûkin ṭap a tih; LALPA berâm ruol chu sala man an ni tâk leiin ka mit chu rinum titakin ṭap a ta, mitthliin luong thlâng a tih."
18,"Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory.","Lal kuoma le a nu kuoma chun hril la: “Inngaitlâwm unla, ṭhung ro, in lukâwmhai chu a hung inhnuoi tah a, in ropuina lallukhum ngei chu."
19,"The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.","Sim ram khawpuihai chu khâr- in an um tah a, a hawng ding tu- khawm an um nawh; Juda chu a rêngin sala ṭhuoiin a um a: a rêng a ramin sala ṭhuoiin a um a nih,” tiin."
20,"Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?","I mithai kha hang inlên la, hmâr tienga inthawka hunghai saw en ta, i berâm ruol, nanga kuoma pêka um, i berâm ruol mawitak el kha khâwlai am a um a?"
21,"What wilt thou say, when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou hast thyself taught to be friends to thee? shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?","Nangma kal zawngin anni chu ân chûktir a nih ti hrein, i ruolhai chu i chungah luah a sie pha chun ieng am hril tâng i ta? Nuhmei nauhase nat tuor angin nang chu lungngaina chun a man ding che a ni nâwm a nih?"
22,"And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.","I lungril chun, “Hieng thilhai hi iengtiziea ka chunga hung tlung am a na?” i ti a ni thei a; i suolna tam êm lei chun i fênthuo chu hlîm a na, suol- luina i tuok a nih."
23,"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.","Ethiopia mi chun a vun chu a thlengin, keitê khawma a zie chu a thleng thei am a nih? Thil ṭha naw thaw ngaia hmanghai hin thil ṭha chu in thaw ding am a nih?"
24,"Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.","Chuleiin, thlalêra thliin busi a lên hmang hlak angin anni chu sukdar ka tih."
25,"This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.","Hi hi i chan tâwk, keima kuoma inthawka, i chan dinga ruot chu a nih; LALPA chun a tih; kei i mi theinghil tah a, thil dik lo chu i lo ring ta lei khan."
26,"Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.","Chuleiin, kei khawma i fênthuo chu i hmai chunga chun hlîm ka ta, i înzapui chu inlang a tih."
27,"I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?","Ramhnuoi muol chunghaia i châkna hurna, i în hrâmnahai, i uire- nahai, i tirdakumnahai chu ka hmuh a. Aw Jerusalem, i chung a va rik de! sukthieng i ni âwm si nawh a, ieng chen am a la ni ding chu aw?"
