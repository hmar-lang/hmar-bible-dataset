1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,",Juda ram lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim hun laia LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chun hieng hin a tih:
2,"Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.","“Rekab mihai ina chun va fe la, an kuomah thu va hril la, LALPA ina pindan pakhata hin anni chu hung ṭhuoi la, an kuomah uoin dâwn ding pe rawh,” tiin."
3,"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;","Chun, Habazzinia naupa, Jeremia naupa Jaazania le a unau- hai le a naupasalhai po po le, Rekab sûngkuohai po po chu ka ṭhuoi a;"
4,"and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.","Pathien mi Igdalia naupa Hanan naupasalhai pindan, kawtkhâr vêng- tu Sallum naupa Maaseia pindan chunga um, rorêltuhai pindan sîra um LALPA ina chun anni chu ka hung ṭhuoi a;"
5,"And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.","chun, Rekab sûngkaw naupa- salhai hmaa chun maihûn uoina sip le nohai ka sieh a, an kuoma chun, “Uoin hi dâwn ro,” ka tih a."
6,"But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever:","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun an dawn a, “Uoin chu dâwn naw ning ungah; kan thlatu Rekab unaupa Jonadab chun hieng hin thu a mi pêk sih a: ‘Kumkhuoin nangniin amanih, in naupasalhai khawmin amanih uoin hi dâwn ngai naw ti niu a;"
7,"neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn.","in khawm bâwl ngai naw ti niu a, thlai chi khawm thlâk nâwng in ta, grêp huon khawm chîngin amanih, nei khawm nei bawk naw ti niu; nisienlakhawm, in nihai po po chu puon inah chêng in ta, in inpêmna rama chun ni tamtak in um theina dingin,’ tiin."
8,"And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;","Chuongchun, kan thlatu Rekab naupa Jonadab râwl chu, kan dam sûng po poa, keini le kan nuhmeihai le kan naupasalhai le, kan naunu- hmeihai le, uoin dâwn lo dinga a mi tiem chu kan awi a;"
9,"nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:","kan chêngna dinga inhai bâwl lo bawk ding dâmin, thlai chi dâm, lohai dâm, grêp huonhai dâm khawm kan nei bawk nawh a;"
10,"but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.","puon inahai chun kan chêng a, kan thlatu Jonadabin thu a mi pêk ang taphawt chun kan zâwm a nih."
11,"But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.","Amiruokchu, Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chu hi rama hin a hung lai khan, ‘Thaw ro, Kaldai sipaihai ṭi lei le, Suria sipaihai ṭi leiin, Jerusalemah hang fêng ei tiu,’ kan tih a; chuongchun, Jerusalema chun kan hang chêng tah a,” tiin."
12,"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuoma chun a hung tlung tah a:"
13,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith Jehovah.","“Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Fe la, Juda ram mihai le Jerusalem hluotuhai kuoma chun hi hi va hril rawh: ‘Ka thuhai chu ngai dingin, inchûktirna chu in pawm naw ding am a nih?’ LALPA chun a tih."
14,"The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and unto this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment. But I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; and ye have not hearkened unto me.","Uoin dâwn lo dinga thu a naupasalhai a ipêk, Rekab naupa Jonadab thuhai chu thawin a um a, vawisûn ni chen hin an dâwn nawh a, an thlatu thupêk chu an pawm leiin: amiruokchu, zîngkâra thoa thuhrilin, in kuoma chun thu ka hrila chu in ngai si nawh a."
15,"I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.","Chun, zîngkâra thoa anni hung tirin, ‘Mi tin chu mâni lampui suola inthawk chun hung kîr unla, in thil- thawhai chu siemṭha unla, pathien danghai chu an rawng bâwl dingin zui bawk naw ro, chuongchun, nangni le in thlatuhai kuoma ram ka ipêk cheua hin chêng in tih,’ tiin, ka siehlaw zâwlneihai po po chu in kuomah ka hung tir a; nisienla- khawm, in na khawm in sit nawh a, ngai khawm in mi ngai naw kha."
16,"Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;","Rekab naupa Jonadab naupa- salhaiin an pain thu a pêk an thaw vei leh, hi mihai hlak hin an mi ngai si nawh a;"
17,"therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.","chuleiin, LALPA, Sipaihai Pathien, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, Juda ram chunga le Jerusalem hluotuhai po po chunga chun, an chunga thil ṭha naw tlung ding ka hril ta kha ka hung intlungtir ding a nih; an kuomah thu ka hril a, an ngai naw leiin, anni chu ka ko a, an mi dawn naw leiin,” tiin."
18,"And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you;","Chun, Jeremia chun Rekab sûngkuohai kuoma chun a hril a, “Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: In thlatu Jona- dab thupêk chu in awi a, a dânhai po po chu in pawm a, a thupêk ang tak cheua in thaw leiin;"
19,"therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.","sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Rekab naupa Jonadab hin kumkhuoin ka hmaa ngîr ding mi tlasam ngai naw ni,” tiin."
