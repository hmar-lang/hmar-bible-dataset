1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon.","Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotuin ama chu Ramaa in- thawka ân fetir a, Juda rama mi le Jerusalema sal intânghai Babulon tienga sala ṭhuoihai laia khaidieta khuopa ama a ṭhuoi hnunga LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chu."
2,"And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place;","Vêngtu pâwl hotu chun Jeremia chu a ṭhuoi a, a kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien chun hi hmuna hin hieng thil ṭha naw hi tlung dingin a ruot tah a;"
3,"and Jehovah hath brought it, and done according as he spake: because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.","chuongchun, LALPA chun a hung intlungtir a, a hril ang ngei chun a hung thaw tah a; LALPA chunga chun thil in suksuol ta leiin le, a râwl chu in awi naw leiin, hieng thil hi in chungah a hung tlung a ni hi."
4,"And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, thither go.","Tuhin, ngai ta, vawisûn ni hin i kuta khaidiet umhaia inthawk chun kân suo che a nih. Babulon tienga kei mi zui hi i ngaia a ṭha chun, hung la, amiruokchu, Babulon tienga kei mi hung zui chu i ta dinga rin a um chun, ṭhul el rawh; ngai ta, ram po po chu i hmaa chun a um a, khaw tienga khawm i ta dinga ṭha le, i ta dinga remchângna tieng tienga chun, chu tienga chun fe rawh,” a ta."
5,"Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, said he, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present, and let him go.","Chun, chuonga a la fe hma chun, ama chun, “Fe el rawh; Babulon lal Juda ram khawpuihai chunga rorêl- tua a siem Saphan naupa, Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuoma chun kîr nâwk la, mipuihai lai chun ama kuoma chun va um el rawh; annawleh, fena dinga remchâng i tina tieng tieng chun fe el rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, vêngtu hotu chun fâk ding le thilpêk a pêk a, ân fetir tah a."
6,"Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.","Chun, Jeremia chu Mizpaa Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuoma chun a fe tah a, mipui chu rama mâksana la umhai laia chun ama kuomah a va chêng tah a."
7,"Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;","Chun, rama sipai hotuhai po po le an mihaiin Babulon lalin Gedalia Ahikam naupa chu chu rama rorêl- tuah a siem a, a kuoma chun pasal- hai, nuhmeihai, naupanghai, mi rimsitak takhai, Babulona sala ṭhuoia um nawhai chu ân kawltir ti an hriet chun,"
8,"then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, to wit, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.","Mizpaa Gedalia kuoma chun, Nethania naupa Ismael, Karea nau- pasal Johanan le Jonathan, Tanhu- meth naupa Seraia, Netophath mi Ephai naupasalhai, Maakath mi naupa Jezania le anni le an mihai chu an hung tâwl a."
9,"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.","Chun, Saphan naupa, Ahikam naupa Gedalia chun inkhâmin, anni le an mihai kuoma chun a hril a, “Kaldaihai hi an rawng bâwlpêk chu ṭi naw ro; rama chun chêng unla, Babulon lal rawng chu bâwl unla, in ta dingin ṭhâng a tih."
10,"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that shall come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.","Keia chungthua chun, ngai ta u, eini kuoma hunghai, Kaldaihai hmaa ngîr dingin Mizpaa hin ka chêng ding a na; amiruokchu, nangni chun uoin le nipui theirahai chu la khâwm unla, hriek leh, in bâwmahai chun sie unla, khawpui in lâk tahaia chun chêng el ro,” tiin."
11,"Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;","Chuong ang bawk chun Moab rama Juda chênghai po po le, Ammon thlahai laia chêng le, Edoma mihai le, ram po poa chênghai chun, Babulon lal chun hlâbîk Juda rama chun mâksan a la nei a, Saphan naupa, Ahikam naupa Gedalia chu an chunga chun a sie ti an hriet chun,"
12,"then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.","Judahai po po chu hnawthmang an nina hmun senga inthawk chun an hung kîr a, Juda ramah, Mizpaa Gedalia kuoma chun an hung a, uoin le nipui thei rahai chu tamtak el chu an lâk khâwm tah a."
13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,","Chu nawa khawm Karea naupa Johanan le sipaihai hotuhai ram- hnuoia umhai po po chu Mizpaa chun Gedalia kuoma chun an hung a,"
14,"and said unto him, Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.","a kuomah, “Ammon thlahai lal Baalis chun Nethania naupa Ismael chu i hringna la dingin a hung tir ti i hriet am?” an tih a. Nisienlakhawm, Gedalia, Ahikam naupa chun anni chu a taksâwn nawh a."
15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?","Chun, Karea naupa Johanan chun Mizpaa Gedalia kuoma chun inrûkin thu a hril a, “Mi tir la, ka ngên che hi, Nethania naupa Ismael chu that el ka tih; tukhawma hre hliek naw ni hai; ieng dingin am i hringna chu lain, Juda i kuoma hung inkhâwm sunhai chu sukdara umin, Juda rama la um sunhai chu bohmang el an ta?” a ta."
16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.","Nisienlakhawm, Ahikam naupa Gedalia chun Karea naupa Johanan kuoma chun, “Hi thil hi i thaw ding a ni nawh, Ismael chungthuah khêl dêr i hril a ni sih a,” a ta."
