1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,",LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung chu:
2,"Stand in the gate of Jehovah’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah.","“LALPA in dai kawtkhâra chun ngîr la, chutaka chun hi thu hi phuongdar la, hieng hin hril rawh: LALPA be dinga hi dai kawtkhârhaia lût, nangni Juda mihai po po, LALPA thu hi lo hre ta u."
3,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.","Israel Pathien, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: In lampuihai le in thilthawhai chu sukṭha unla, hi hmuna hin inchêngtir ka ti cheu,"
4,"Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, are these.","‘LALPA biekin chu, LALPA biek- in chu, LALPA biekin chu hi hi a nih,’ ti thukhêl dâm hi ring naw ro."
5,For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;,"In lampuihai le in thilthawhai chu in siem ṭha a; mi le a tuolbâwm kara rorêlna tlangtaka in sukthlûk- pêk a,"
6,"if ye oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:","mikhuolhai chu in nêksâwr nawh a, pa nei lohai le hmeithaihai leh; hi hmuna hin mi thiem thisen chu in insuo naw bawk a, nangni le nangni insukpawina dingin pathien danghai chu in zui bawk naw chun,"
7,"then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore.","in thlatuhai kuoma ram ka i pêk tah, inhmaa inthawka kumkhaw- tluong elin, hi hmuna hin inchêngtir ka ti cheu."
8,"Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.","Ngai ta u, thukhêlhliphai, ṭhat- hnemna neilohai chu in ring a."
9,"Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods that ye have not known,","Inruin, tuolthatin, uirein, khêla inkhâmin, Baal hmaa chun rimin- hnik rawin pathien in hriet nawhai chu zuiin,"
10,"and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations?","‘Sansuokin ei um tah’ tiin, hieng thil pawrchehai po po hi thaw dingin hi in ka hming chawisana hin hungin ka hmaa chun in hung ngîr ding am a nih?"
11,"Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah.","Hi in ka hming chawi hi in mit- hmua chun inruhai pûk a lo ni ta a ni maw? Ngai ta u, keiin, keima ngeiin ka hmu tah, LALPA chun a tih."
12,"But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.","Amiruokchu, tuhin ka hmun Siloa chun fe unla, a tira inthawka ka hming kân umtir zingnaa chun; ka mi Israelhai khawhlona leia thil ka ithawhai chu va hmu ta u."
13,"And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not:","Chun, tuhin LALPA chun, ‘Hieng thilthawhai po po hi in thaw ta leiin, inhmataka thoa thu hrilin, in kuoma ngei chun thu ka lo hril tah a; nisienlakhawm, in ngai si nawh a; ka ko cheu a, in mi dawn nawh a;"
14,"therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.","chuleiin, in thlatuhai le nangni kuoma ka pêk, hmun le in ringna innghatna, ka hming chawia ko, in chunga chun, Siloa chunga ka lo thaw ta ang bawk khan ka thaw ding a nih."
15,"And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.","Ephraim chihai po po, in unauhai po po kha ka lo hnawt suok ta ang khan ka mithmua inthawk hnawt suok ka ti cheu."
16,"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.","Chuleiin, hi hnam ta ding hin ṭawngṭai naw la, an ta dingin ṭawng- ṭaina amanih, râwl amani khawm insuo naw rawh; chun, ka kuoma khawm hnina khawm hung siem bawk naw rawh; ka lo ngai âwm si naw cheh a."
17,Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?,Jerusalem kawtthlêrahai le Juda khawpuihaia an thawhai chu i hmu nâwm a nih?
18,"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.","Naupanghai chun thing an inkhâwm a, pahai chun mei an sêm a, nuhmeihai chun bei an hmet a; vân lalnu ta dinga beithlum siem dingin le, lunginsennaa an mi chawktho theina dinga pathien danghai kuoma dâwnmi thilinhlânhai dâm chu bur dingin."
19,"Do they provoke me to anger? saith Jehovah; do they not provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?","Kei chu an mi suklungsen am a nih? LALPA chun a tih; an inzakna dingin, anni le anni chu an insuk- lungsen a ni nâwm a nih?"
20,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, ka lungin- senna le ka ṭiumna chu hi hmuna hin bunthlâk nîng a ta, mihriem chunga le, ramsahai chunga le, rama thing- hai chunga le, hnuoia rahai chunga chun; chun, kâng a ta, ṭhel ni ngai naw ni."
21,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh.","Israel Pathien, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: In inthâwina- haia chun in pumrawhmang thilin- hlânhai chu belsa unla, sa chu fa ro."
22,"For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices:","Inthâwinahai le pumrawhmang thilinhlân chungthua hin Aigupta rama inthawka anni ka hung ṭhuoi suok nia chun, in thlatuhai kuoma chun thu hrilin, thupêk ka lo nei nawh;"
23,"but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.","nisienlakhawm, hi thua hin thu ka pêk a, “Ka râwl hi ngai unla, in Pathien nîng ka ta, nangni khawm ka mihai nîng in tih; chun, thu ka pêk cheu po po kha hraw unla, in ta dingin ṭhâng a tih,” tiin."
24,"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.","Nisienlakhawm, an ngai nawh a, an na khawm an sit bawk nawh a, amiruokchu, anni remruotnaa le, an lungril rilo kâwmâwna chu hrawin, hmatiengah ni loin an kîr nâwk ta lem a."
25,"Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:","In thlatuhai Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok nia inthawka vawisûn ni chen hin ni tin inhmatak- in thoin, ka zâwlneihai ka siehlawhai po po chu an kuomah ka hung tir a;"
26,"yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.","nisienlakhawm, keia thu chu an ngai chuong nawh a, an na khawm an sit bawk nawh a, an rîng chu an suktlûn a, an thlatuhai nêkin an thaw ṭha naw lem tah a."
27,And thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.,"Chun, hieng thuhai po po hi an kuoma chun i hril ding a nih; ami- ruokchu, i thu chu ngai naw ni hai; anni chu ko bawk i ta, nisienla- khawm, dawn naw ni hai che."
28,"And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “LALPA an Pathien râwl khawm ngai loa, inchûktirna khawm pawm bawk lohai chu hi hnam hi an nih; thudik chu a riral a, an baua inthawk chun sât thlâkin a um a,” tîng i tih."
29,"Cut off thy hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.","Aw Jerusalem, i sam chu tan rawh, peihâwn la, bâwlhmun tlânga- hai chun sûnna siem rawh; LALPA chun a lunginsenna thlahai chu a nghatsanin a hnâwl ta sih a."
30,"For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith Jehovah: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.","Juda thlahai chun ka mithmua thil ṭha naw chu an lo thaw ta sih a, LALPA chun a tih: sukpawrche ding- in, in ka hming chawia koa chun an tirdakumnahai chu an sie tah a."
31,"And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind.","Hinnom naupa ruoma chun Topheth bâwlhmunhai chu an naupa- salhai le an naunuhmeihai meia an rawna dingin an bâwl tah a; chuong chu thu ka pêk ngai nawh a, ka lungrila khawm lût khawm a hung lût ngai nawh."
32,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.","Chuleiin, ngai ta, a nihai a hung tlung, LALPA chun a tih; Topheth amanih, Hinnom naupa ruom ama- nih ti ni ta ngai naw nih a, Inthatna ruom ti ni lem tâng a tih, hi Topheth hmuna hin inphûmna hmun ding a um naw chen khawma an inphûm ding a ni sih a."
33,"And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.","Chuongchun, hieng mipuihai ruonghai hi, chunglêng vatehai ta dinga bu nîng a ta, ramsahai ta ding khawma; tukhawma an hnawt hmang âwm si nawh a."
34,"Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.","Chun, Juda khawpuihaia in- thawk le Jerusalem kawtthlêrhaia inthawk chun hlimna râwl dâm, lâwmna râwl dâm, moneitu râwl dâm, mo râwl dâm inrêtir ka tih; ram chu suksiet a ni ding a ni sih a."
