1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,","Aigupta rama Juda chêng po pohai, Migdola dâm, Tahpan- hesa dâm, Nopha dâm, Pathros rama chênghai dâm chungthua Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chu,"
2,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,","“Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Juda ram khawpuihai le Jerusalem chunga thil ṭha naw ka hung intlungtirhai po po kha in hmu tah a, ngai ta u, vawisûn ang dâm hin râusan an ni a nih, mi tukhawm an chêng naw a nih;"
3,"because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers.","lunginsennaa mi chawktho ding- in an thlatuhaiin amanih, anni ngei khawma an hriet lohai pathien danghai chu an rawng bâwl ding le, an kuoma riminhnik raw dinga an fe a, chuong khawhlonahai an thawna lei chun."
4,"Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.","Zingkâra tho a, anni hung tirin, ka siehlaw zâwlneihai po po, ‘Aw hi thil tirdakum ka theida hi chu thaw naw ro,’ tiin in kuomah ka hung tir a."
5,"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.","Nisienlakhawm, an ngai nawh a, Pathien danghai kuoma riminhnik raw a an khawhlonahai chu nghat- san dingin an nahai khawm an sit nawh a:"
6,"Wherefore my wrath and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.","Chuleiin, ka lunginsenna le ṭîumna chu Jerusalem kawtthlêrhaia le Juda ram khawpuihai chunga chun bunthlâkin a um a, mûtchawkin a um ta a ni kha; chuongchun, vawisûn ni chena an ni angin, suksiet le râusan an ni tah a."
7,"Therefore now thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;","Chuleiin, tuhin LALPA sipaihai Pathien, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: nangnia inthawka pasal, nuhmei, naute le nene ne lai, Juda rama inthawka mâksan khawm um dêr lo dinga iengdinga in thlarauhai chung ngeia hieng thil ṭha naw hi thaw am in na?"
8,"in that ye provoke me unto anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?","chuongahai chun in kut sinthaw- hai chun in mi suklungsen a, in va mikhuolna tiengahai chun Aigupta rama pathien danghai kuoma chun riminhnik dâm in rawh a; chuong chu hi hnuoia hnam po pohai laia thu- sekawk le, ṭawngsephur le, sât thlâk in ni theina ding chau a ni naw am a nih?"
9,"Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?","In thlatuhai khawhlona dâm, Juda ram lalhai khawhlona dâm, an nuhmeihai khawhlona dâm le nangni khawhlona dâm ngei khawm, in nuhmeihai khawhlonahai Jerusalem kawtthlêrhaia le, Juda rama an thawhai kha in hriet zing naw am a nih?"
10,"They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.","Vawisûn ni chen khawm hin an insukhnuoi nawh a, an ṭi bawk nawh a, ka dân khawm chu an hraw bawk nawh a, ka thuruothai khawm chu an hraw nawh; chuong in thlatuhai le nangni hma ngeia ka lo sie tahai kha."
11,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.","Chuleiin, sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, Juda po po sât thla ding cheuin, a se tiengah in kuom tieng ka hmai kân nghat cheu a nih."
12,"And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.","Juda la um sunhai chu ṭhuoi ka ta, chutaka va mikhuol dinga Aigupta ram tieng an hmai innghathai chu; chun, anni chu bohmang vawng an ta, Aigupta rama chun tlûng an ta; ṭâmna le kâwlhnâmin anni chu suk- bohmang nîng an tih; thîng an ta, a chîn taka inthawka a lien tak chenin kâwlhnâm le ṭâmin thîng an tih; chuongchun, anni chu hnâwmhnawk le, makti ding le, ṭawngsephur le ṭawngsekawk nîng an tih."
13,"For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;",Hripui le ṭâmna le kâwlhnâma Jerusalem ka hrem ang bawk khan Aigupta rama chênghai chu ka hrem ding a ni sih a;
14,"so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.","chuongchun, Juda la um sun, va mikhuol dinga Aigupta rama va fehai chu tukhawm, Juda ram hung kîr nâwka chêng an inhâwkna rama hung kîr nâwk ding hin suokthleng naw ni hai a, um zing bawk naw ni hai; a suokthlenghai ti chau naw chu tukhawm an hung kîr nâwk âwm si nawh a,” tiin."
15,"Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, mi an nuhmeihaiin pathien danghai kuomah riminhnik an raw ti hretuhai po po le, nuhmei lo ngîr vehai po po le, inkhâwm nasa- takhai, Pathrosa Aigupta rama mi chêng po pohai chun Jeremia chu an dawn a,"
16,"As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee.","“LALPA hminga kan kuoma i thuhril chungthua chun, i thu chu ngai naw ning ungah."
17,"But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.","Amiruokchu, kan baua thu suok po pohai, vâna lalnu kuoma rimin- hnik raw ding dâm, a kuoma dâwnmi thilinhlân buok ding dâm, Jerusalem kawtthlêrhaia le Juda ramhaia, keini le kan thlatuhai le, kan lalhai le kan rorêltuhai leh kan lo thaw ta hlak ang khan thaw ngei kan tih; chuong lai chun fâk ding tinrêng kan neiin, a ṭha hlea, a sietna kan hmu nawh."
18,"But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.","Amiruokchu, hi vân lalnu kuoma riminhnik raw kan mâka, dâwnmi thilinhlân buok kan mâk china chu thil iengkim kan tlasamin, ṭâmna le kâwlhnâmin a mi sukbo- hmang zo a ni ta hi."
19,"And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands?","Chun, vân lalnu kuoma rimin- hnik kan raw a, dâwnmi thilinhlân kan buok lai chun, kan pasalhai ṭhang loin dâwnmi thilinhlân chu kan buokin, ama biekna ding beithlumhai kan siem am a nih?” an tih a."
20,"Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying,","Chun, Jeremia chun, mipui po po, pasalhai, nuhmeihai, mi po po chu dawnnaa ama dawntuhai kuoma chun a hril a,"
21,"The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and came it not into his mind?","“Jerusalem kawtthlêrahai le, Juda rama nangni le, in thlatuhai le, in lalhai le, in rorêltuhai le, chu rama mihaiin riminhnik in raw hlak kha LALPA chun a hriet zing nawin, a lungril khawm a hung tlung naw am a nih?"
22,"so that Jehovah could not longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.","Thil tirdakum in thawhai lei le, in thilthawhai suol lei chun LALPA chun a tuor pei ta nawh a; vawisûn ni ang chen khawma a ni ang sawn, in ram chu râusan le, maktia um le, ṭawngsekawk, hluotu um lo a lo ni ta kha."
23,"Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as it is this day.","Riminhnik chu in raw leiin, LALPA chungah in lo suksuol ta leiin, LALPA râwl chu in ngai nawh a, a dân khawm in hraw nawh a, a thuruothaia le, a thu inhriettirahai chun in um bawk nawh a; chuleiin, vawisûn nia a um ang hin, hieng thil ṭha nawhai hi in chungah a hung tlung a ni hi,” tiin."
24,"Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:","Chu nawa khawm chun Jeremia chun mipuihai po po kuoma le nu- hmeihai kuoma chun, “Aigupta rama Juda um po pohai, LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u;"
25,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her: establish then your vows, and perform your vows.","sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Nangni ni leh, in nuhmeihai ni leh in bauin thu in hril a, in kuthaiin in sukpuitling pei a, ‘Vân lalnu kuoma riminhnik raw ding le, a kuoma dâwnmi thilinhlânhai chu buok dingin, thutiem ei tiem tahai ei thaw ngei ding a nih,’ tiin; chuong a ni chun, in thutiem chu sukpuitling unla, in thutiemhai chu thaw ro chu!"
26,"Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Jehovah liveth.","Chuleiin, Aigupta rama Juda chêng po pohai, LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u: Ngai ta u, ‘LALPA Pathien chu a hring zing angin,’ tiin, Aigupta ram po poa Juda mi tukhawm baua chun ka hming chu lam a ni ta nawna dingin, ka hming ropuitak chu sâlin ṭawng kân khâm a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
27,"Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.","Ngai ta u, thil ṭha tiengah ni loin, thil ṭha naw tienga dingin anni chu ka enkai dêk a nih: Aigupta rama Juda mi um po pohai chu, an ram dêr hmakhat chun, ṭâmna dâm le kâwl- hnâm dâma anni chu sukbohmang nîng an tih."
28,"And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.","Chuong kâwlhnâma inthawka suokthlenghai, mi tlâwmte chau chu Aigupta rama inthawk chun Juda rama chun hung kîr nâwk an tih; chuongchun, va mikhuol dinga Aigupta rama Juda la um sun va fehai po po khan, keia thu am a ni, anni thu a ieng am a dingchang lema ti hre tâng an tih."
29,"And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:","Chun, hi hi in ta dinga inchikna nîng a tih, LALPA chun a tih: thil ṭha naw tienga dingin ka thu chu a dingchang ngei a nih ti in hriet theina dingin hi hmuna hin ka hrem ding cheu a nih."
30,"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta Pharao Hophra Aigupta lal chu a hmêlmahai kuta le, ama hring- na zawngtuhai kuta chun ka pêk ding a nih; Juda lal Zedekia chu Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar a hmêlma le ama hringna zawngtu kuta chun ka pêk ang khan,” tiin."
