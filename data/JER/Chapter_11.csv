1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,",LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chun:
2,"Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;","“Hi thuthlung thuhai hi lo ngai la, Juda rama mihai le Jerusalem hluotuhai kuoma chun hril rawh;"
3,"and say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant,","chun, an kuoma chun hieng hin hril la; Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hi thuthlung thuhai hre lo mi chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se:"
4,"which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God;","Aigupta ram, thîr sutna pûm meia inthawka anni ka ṭhuoi suok laia, ‘Ka râwl ngai unla, thaw ro, chuongchun, ka mihai nîng in ta, kei khawm in Pathien nîng ka tih,’ tia in thlatuhai kuoma thu ka lo pêk tah thuhai chu."
5,"that I may establish the oath which I sware unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, O Jehovah.","hi vawisûn nia anga hi, nenetui le khuoizua luong ram anni pe dinga ka lo tiem ta chu, in thlatuhai kuoma ka ṭawng inkhâmna chu ka sukpui- tling theina dingin,” tiin. Chun, kei chun “Amen, aw LALPA,” tiin ka dawn a."
6,"And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah; Jerusalem kawtthlêrahai po po le, Juda khawpuiahai po po chun hienga hril hin va phuong rawh: Hieng thuthlung thuhai hi ngai unla, thaw ro."
7,"For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.","Aigupta rama inthawka anni ka hung ṭhuoi suok nia inthawk tah vawisûn ni chen khawm hin. “Ka râwl chu awi ro,” tia hrila, inhmataka thoa, anni chu inhriettirin, in thlatu- hai chu ṭhahnemngaitakin ka lo inhriettir tah a."
8,"Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.","Nisienlakhawm, an awi nawh a, an na khawm an sit bawk nawh a, amiruokchu, mi tin chu mâni lungril ngarna ang pei chun an fe lem a; chuleiin, an chunga chun hi thu- thlung thuhai po po hi ka hung intlungtir a, chuong chu thaw dingin thu ka pêk a, nisienlakhawm, an thaw nawh a,’ tiin."
9,"And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Juda rama mihai laia le, Jerusalema chênghai laia chun phierrûkna hmuin a um a nih."
10,"They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.",An thlatuhai ka thu khawm ngai nuom lohai suolna tienga chun an kîr nâwk tah a nih; an rawngbâwl dingin an pathienhai hnung chu an zui a; an thlatuhai le ka lo siem tah ka thuthlung chu Israel sûngkuo le Juda sûngkuo hin an lo bawsiet ta a ni hi.
11,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry unto me, but I will not hearken unto them.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, an chungah thil ṭha naw, an pumpel thei dêr lo ding chu ka hung intlungtir ding a nih; ka kuomah hung khêk an ta, nisienla- khawm, anni chu lo ngai naw ning ah."
12,Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.,"Chun, Juda khawpuihai le, Jerusalem hluotuhai chu, riminhnik an inhlânna pathienhai kuoma chun fêng an ta, ko an tih; nisienlakhawm, chuonga an buoi lai huna chun anni chu sandam ngai hrim hrim naw ni hai."
13,"For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.","Aw Juda, i khawpui ni zât ang pei el chun i pathienhai chu an um sih a; Jerusalem kawtthlêr zât zâtin inzâpuiumtakin mâichâmhai, Baal kuoma riminhnik rawna ding ngei chu, i lo siem ta bawk a."
14,"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me because of their trouble.","Chuleiin, hi hnam ta ding hin hni naw la, an ta dingin hnina ama- nih, râwl amanih insuo bawk naw rawh, an buoinaa dinga ka kuoma an khêk pha khawm chun anni chu ka ngai naw ding a ni sih a."
15,"What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.","Thil tirdakumtak chu thaw zing si chun, ka hmangaitak chun ka inah chan ieng am a nei ta leh? Intiem- kamna le saserhai chun in sietna ding ân pumpeltir thei ding am a nih? Chuong a ni chun in hlim thei ding am a nih?"
16,"Jehovah called thy name, A green olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.","LALPA chun i hming a sak a, Oliv thing hring, ra ṭhatak le mawi a ti che a, buoina nasatak ri chun a chunga chun mei a sem a, a kauhai chu a tliek tah a."
17,"For Jehovah of hosts, who planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense unto Baal.","Sipaihai LALPA, nangni phun- tu cheu chun Israel sûngkuo le Juda sûngkuoin Baal hmaa riminhnikhai inhlân a, mi suklungsen dinga anni ta dinga thilsuol an lo thaw ta leiin i chungah thil ṭha naw chu a hril lang tah a nih."
18,"And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then thou showedst me their doings.","LALPA chun chu chu a mîn hriettir a, ka hriet ngei a; chun, nang chun an thilthawhai chu i mîn entir a."
19,"But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.","Nisienlakhawm, berâmte zai- nêm a thattu hmaa ṭhuoia um ang chu ka na, “Thing chu chutaka a ra le chun suksieng ei ta, ama chu mi hring rama inthawk chun sât thlâng ei ta, a hming chu hriet zing a ni nawna dingin,” tia, ka chunga thu phierrûk an phier khawm chu ka lo hriet nawh a."
20,"But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.","Nisienlakhawm, aw sipaihai LALPA, indiktaka rorêltu, lungril le hrietnahai fietu, anni chunga i phubalâkna chu mîn hmutir rawh; nangma kuoma chu ka thu chun ka hung târlang sih a."
21,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand;","Chuleiin, i hringna lâk tumtu Anathoth mihai chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng hin a tih; anni chun, “Kan kuta i thi nawna dingin LALPA hming chun thu hril naw rawh,” an ta;"
22,"therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;","chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: “Ngai ta, anni chu ka hrem ding a nih; tlangvâlhai chu kâwlhnâmah thîng an ta, an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai chu ṭâmin thîng an tih;"
23,"and there shall be no remnant unto them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.","anni laia tukhawm hla um naw ni hai; Anathoth mihai chunga chun thil ṭha naw, anni hung hremna kum chu ka hung intlungtir ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
