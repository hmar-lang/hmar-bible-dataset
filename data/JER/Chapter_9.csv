1,"Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!","Aw ka chipuihai naunu sukhluma um chu a sûn a zâna ka ṭa theina dingin ka lu hi tuihai ni sienla, ka mithai hi mitthli tuikhurhai hung ni sien chu!"
2,"Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.","Ka chipuihai hi ka mâksana, an kuoma inthawka ka fe theina dingin, thlalêra hin khuol inzinhai riekna hmun nei lang chu aw! anni chu uirehai le, mi khawhlohai um khâwm an ni vawng el sih a."
3,"And they bend their tongue, as it were their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.","Thudik nawa dingin an thalngul ang elin an lei chu an thlep a; chu rama chun thahrâttakin an hung inṭhang a, thudika ruok chun ni loin; thil suola inthawkin thil suola vêk chun an pakai a, kei khawm an mi hriet hlawl nawh, LALPA chun a tih."
4,"Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.","Mi tinin mâni tuolbâwmhai pawisa seng unla, unau ieng ang khawm chu ring naw ro; unau tinhai chu mâni hmasieltak el, tuolbâwm tinhai khawm chu thukhêl le invâk mi an ni âwm sih a."
5,"And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity.","Chuongchun, mi tin chun mâni tuolbâwm chu hlêm a ta, thu dik hril naw ni; an lei chu khêlthu hril dingin an inchûktir tah a; thil suol thaw dingin anni le anni chu an insuk- lungzîng a."
6,"Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.","I chêngna hmun chu inhlêmna lailia chun a na; inhlêmna lei chun kei mi hriet khawm chu an nuom naw a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
7,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how else should I do, because of the daughter of my people?","Chuleiin, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, anni chu suktui ka ta, ka fie ding a nih; ka chipuihai naunu lei chun ieng dang am thaw tâng ka ta?"
8,"Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him.","An lei chu thi theina thal a na; thukhêl a hril a, mi pakhatin a tuol- bâwm kuomah a bau chun thla- muongumtakin thu a hril a, nisien- lakhawm, a lungril chun ama chu ân chân rûk zing a."
9,Shall I not visit them for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?,Hieng thilhai lei hin ka hrem hrim naw ding am a nih? LALPA chun a tih; hnam hieng ang hai chunga hin ka thlarau chun phuba a lâk naw ding am a nih?
10,"For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone.","An kâng zo tah a, tukhawm an fe tlang ta ngai naw leiin, tlânghai ta ding chun sûnin ṭapinrûm ka ta, thlalêra tlatna hmunhai ta ding chun sûn ka tih; mihai chun ran ruol râwl khawm chu hre thei ta naw ni hai a; chunglêng vatehai le ramsahai khawm chu an tlânse tah a, an tlân- hmang tah."
11,"And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.","Chun, Jerusalem chu hmun- hnawk intiengkhâwmna le, satene- hai ta dinga chêngna hmunah siem ka tih; Juda khawpuihai khawm chu hluotu um loa râusanah siem bawk ka tih. Hi hi hrethiem thei dinga mi var tu am a um a?"
12,"Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it? wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passeth through?","Hi hi a hrilfie theina dinga LALPA bauin a kuoma thu a lo hrilna chu tu am a na? Ieng leia ram chu thlalêr anga a kâng a, a bohmang a, tukhawm an fe thleng ta nâwm a na?"
13,"And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: An hmaa dân ka sie chu an nghatsan a, ka râwl khawm an awi nawh a, chu- taka chun an fe bawk naw leiin a nih;"
14,"but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them;","nisienlakhawm, an lungril ngarna ang pei chu an hraw lem a, Baal hnung chu an zui a, an thlatu- haiin anni an lo inchûktir ta ang khan;"
15,"therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.","chuleiin, sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, hi hnam hi, anni ngei hi sairam khâin vai ka ta, tûr pawl tui dâwn dingin pêng ka tih."
16,"I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.",An thlatuhai le anni khawma an hriet ngailo hnamhai laia chun sukdar ka ta; anni chu ka sukbo- hmang vawng hmakhat chun an hnungah kâwlhnâm tir ka tih.
17,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skilful women, that they may come:","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Nangnîn ngaituo unla, an hung theina dingin nuhmei ṭapthiemhai ko ro; chun, an hung theina dingin nuhmei vervêkhai chu inkotir bawk unla,"
18,"and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.","hung inhmaw hai sienla, ei ta dingin ṭapinrûm raw hai se, ei mithai chu mitthlia a far theina ding le, ei mitvunhai chun tui a phusuok theina dingin."
19,"For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.","Ziona inthawk chun ṭapinrûm ri chu hriet a ni sih a; Ei siet nasat tâkzie chu! ram chu ei nghatsan a, ei chêngnahai chu an sukchim tâk leiin nasataka sukbuoiin ei um a."
20,"Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.","Aw nangni nuhmeihai, LALPA thu chu la lo ngai unla, in nahai chun a baua thusuok chu hre sienla, mi tinin mâni naunuhmeihai seng chu ṭapinrûm inchûktir sienla, mi tinin a tuolbâwm chu sûn dân inchûktir raw se."
21,"For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.","Thina chu ei tukverhaia chun a hung a, ei in ropuiahai chun a hung lût sih a; kawtthlêra inthawka tlang- vâlhai le, puotienga inthawka nau- panghai chu sâtthla dingin."
22,"Speak, Thus saith Jehovah, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman; and none shall gather them.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Thu chu hril rawh, hmun âwlahai chun mihriem ruonghai chu êkdûr ang chun tlâng an ta, busîk hnunga hmu ṭhel ang chau chun, tukhawma la khâwm naw ni."
23,"Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches;",LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: mi var chun a varna suong naw raw se; mi thilthawthei khawm chun a thilthawtheina suong bawk naw raw se; mi hausa khawm chu a hausakna suong bawk naw raw se;
24,"but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he hath understanding, and knoweth me, that I am Jehovah who exerciseth lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith Jehovah.","a suong taphawt chun hi hi suong lem raw se, kei hi LALPA lung- insietna neia, rorêla, hnuoi chunga hin felna thil thaw hlak chu ka nih ti hre a hrietthiemna chu suong lem raw se; hieng thilhaia hin ka lâwm sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
25,"Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision:","Ngai ta, nihai chu a hung tlung, LALPA chun a tih; sertan ni sia sertanlohai po po chu hrem ka ta,"
26,"Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair cut off, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.","Aigupta dâm, Juda dâm, Edom dâm, Ammon thlahai le, Moab thla- hai, barêp hmul vawa thlalêra chêng- hai po po le chun, chuong hnamhai po po chu sertan lo an na, Israel sûng- kuohai po po chu lungrila sertan lo an nih."
