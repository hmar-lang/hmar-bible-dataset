1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying:","Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar le a sipaihai po po le, a ram sûnga hnuoi chunga lalram po pohai le mi po poin Jerusalem le a khawpuihai po po an do laia LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chu:"
2,"Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:","LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Fe la, Juda lal Zedekia kuoma chun thu hril la, ama chu hieng hin hril rawh: LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, hi khawpui hi Babulon lal kutah ka pêk ding a na, ama chun meiin râwng a ta;"
3,"and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.","nang khawm a kuta inthawk chun suok naw ti nih a, ṭhuoi ni ngei ngei i ta, a kuta pêk i ni ding a nih: Babulon lal mithai chu nanga mithai ngei chun hmûng a ta, ama chun bau inphâkin i kuomah thu hril a tih; chun, nang chu Babulonah fe bawk i tih."
4,"Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah: thus saith Jehovah concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword;","Amiruokchu, Juda lal Aw Zede- kia, LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta; i chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Kâwlhnâm chun thi naw ti nih a;"
5,"thou shalt die in peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee; and they shall lament thee, saying, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, saith Jehovah.","thlamuongtakin thîng i tih; thlatuhai, i hmaa lal hmasa lo um tahai riminhnik an rawpêk ang khan, nangma ta ding khawma riminhnik râwng an ta, “Aw lalpa!” tiin ṭâng an ti che; hi thu hi ka lo hril ta si a, LALPA chun a tih."
6,"Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,","Chun, Jeremia chun Juda ram lal Zedekia kuoma chun hieng thuhai hi Jerusalema chun a hril a;"
7,"when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.","chuong lai chun Babulon lal sipaihai chun Jerusalem dâm, Juda rama khawpui mâksana la umhai po po dâm, Lakis le Azeka dâm chu an hung rûn mêk a; hieng khawpuihai chau hi Juda rama chun khawpui kul neia um sun chu an ta sih a."
8,"The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;","Lal Zedekiain Jerusalema mipui- hai po po kuoma, an kuoma zalênna thu phuong dinga thuthlung a siem hnunga Jeremia kuoma LALPA thu hung tlung chu:"
9,"that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, that is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondmen of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.","“Mi tin chun a siehlawpa ama- nih, a siehlawnu amanih, Hebraipa amanih, Hebrainu amanih a ni chun, zalênin insuoktir a ta; a unau Juda chanpui rawngbâwlpêkin tukhawm a um ding a ni nawh”, tiin;"
10,"And all the princes and all the people obeyed, that had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondmen of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:","chun, mipui po po le rorêltuhai po po chun an remtih a; thuthlung chu an awi tah a, chuongchun, mi tin chun mâni siehlawpa amanih, mi tin chun mâni siehlawnu amani chu zalênin insuoktir a ta, tukhawma ama rawng chu bâwlpêk ni ta naw ni; chu chu an awi a, an infetir tâwl tah a:"
11,"but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.","nisienlakhawm, chu hnunga chun an lamlêt a, siehlawpahai le siehlawnuhai chu zalêna an lo insuoktir tahai chu kîr dingin an ti nâwk a, siehlawpahai ding le sie- hlawnuhai ni dingin thununna hnuoiah an lâk lût nâwk tah a;"
12,"Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,","chuleiin, LALPA thu chu LALPA kuoma inthawk chun Jeremia kuoma chun a hung tlung a;"
13,"Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,","“LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Intângna ina in- thawk, Aigupta rama inthawka anni ka ṭhuoi suok lai chun in thlatuhai kuoma chun hienga hril hin thuthlung ka lo siem tah a:"
14,"At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.","‘Mi tinin a unaupa Hebrai mi nia, ama kuoma zawra lo um amanih, ama chu kum ruk sûng rawng lo bâwlpêk ta chu, kum sari tâwpa chun infetir in ta, nangmaa inthawk chun a thlâwnin în fetir ding a nih,’ tiin, nisienlakhawm, in thlatuhai chun an mi ngai nawh a, an na khawm an sit nawh."
15,"And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:","Chun, tu el khawm in hung lamlêt a, mi tinin mâni tuolbâwm ta dinga zalênna phuongin, ka mit- hmuah thilindik chu in thaw tah a; chun, ka hming chawia ko ina chun ka hmaah thuthlung khawm chu in lo siem ta bawk a."
16,"but ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.","Amiruokchu, in inher a, ka hming chu in sukpawrche tah a; mi tin chun a siehlawpa le a siehlawnu, an nuom anga zalêna in infetir tahai chu in inkîrtir nâwk tah a; thununna hnuoia chun in lâklût nâwk a, in ta dinga siehlawpahai le siehlawnuhai ni dingin."
17,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ye have not hearkened unto me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim unto you a liberty, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Mi tinin mâni unaupa chunga le, mi tinin mâni tuolbâwm chunga zalênna phuong dingin ka thu in ngai naw a nih; ngai ta u, kâwlhnâm kuoma le, ṭâm kuoma le hripui kuoma chun in ta dingin zalênna chu ka phuong a nih, LALPA chun a tih: chuongchun, leihnuoia lalram po pohai laia hnungtieng hmatienga hnawt lêng dingin ka siem ding cheu a nih."
18,"And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof;","Chun, ka thuthlung bawsetu mihai, bâwngtê chu tum hnia chana a kâra fethleng ka hmaa an thuthlung thuhai thaw si lohai chu pêng ka ta;"
19,"the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf;","Juda ram lalhai, Jerusalema rorêltuhai, mi tillâkhai, thiempuhai le, rama mi po po chu bâwngtê tum hni inkâra lût thleng tahai chu;"
20,"I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth.","anni khawm chu an hringna zawngtuhai le, an hmêlmahai kuta chun pêng ka tih; chuongchun, an taksa thihai khawm chu hnuoia ramsahai le chunglêng vatehai ta dinga bu nîng a tih."
21,"And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, that are gone away from you.","Chun, Juda ram lal Zedekia le a rorêltuhai khawm chu an hmêlmahai kuta le, an hringna zawngtuhai kuta le, nangnia inthawka hang fe, Babulon lal sipaihai kuta chun pêng ka tih."
22,"Behold, I will command, saith Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.","Ngai ta u, thu pêng ka ta, hi khawpuia hin hung inkîrtir ka tih; LALPA chun a tih: chun, do an ta, lâng an ta, meiin râwng an tih; chuongchun, Juda khawpuihai chu hluotu um loa râusanah siem ka tih,” tiin."
