1,"Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,","Tuhin, sal intâng upa la um- sunhai le, thiempuhai le, zâwl- neihai le, mipui po po Jerusalema inthawka Babulona Nebukadnezzar- in sala a ṭhuoihai kuoma zâwlnei Jeremia lekhathawn thuhai chu hienghai hi an nih:"
2,"(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, and the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem),","(lal Jekonia le lalnu nu le, mi tillâkhai le, Juda ram le Jerusalema lalhai le, mi themthiemhai le, thîrsu- hai leh Jerusalem an suoksan hnung chun a nih)."
3,"by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying,","Saphan naupa Elasa le, Hilkia naupa Gemaria (Babulon lal Nebu- kadnezzar kuoma Juda ram lal Zedekian Babulona a tirhai) kuta chun thawn a nih"
4,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon:","Jerusalema inthawka Babulona sala intâng dinga kân ṭhuoihmang- tirhai po po kuoma chun, sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng- hin a tih:"
5,"Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.","Inhai bâwl unla, a sûngahai chun chêng unla, huonhai chu siem unla, an rahai chu fa bawk ro;"
6,"Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters: and multiply ye there, and be not diminished.","nuhmeihai nei unla, naupasal- hai, naunuhmeihai nei unla: in naupasalhai nuhmei inneitir unla, in naunuhmeihai khawm pasal inneitir bawk unla, naupasalhai le naunu- hmeihai an nei theina dingin; chu- taka chun hung pung pei unla, kiem tieng pan ta naw ro."
7,"And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto Jehovah for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.","Chun, sala intâng dinga kân ṭhuoihmangtirna cheu khawpuia inremna chu zawng unla, chu chu LALPA kuoma chun hni ro; chutaka inremna lei chun muongna in nei ding a ni sih a."
8,"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you; neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.","Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Nangni laia in zâwlnei umhai le, in khawhri zâwl- haiin hlêm naw raw se cheu, chun, in manghai in imang khawm chu ring bawk naw unla."
9,"For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith Jehovah.","Keia hmingin khêlin in kuomah thu an hril hlak sih a; anni chu ka tir an ni nawh, LALPA chun a tih."
10,"For thus saith Jehovah, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a; Babulona intâng kum sâwmsari a tling hnunga chun, hung sir ka ti cheu a, hi hmuna inkîrtir ding cheuin in kuoma chun ka thu tiem chu hlen ka tih."
11,"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end.","Nangni tieng panga ka ngaituo, thil ngaituohai chu ka hriet sih a, LALPA chun a tih, in tâwpna tienga beiseina siempêk ding cheuin thil ṭha naw ni loin, thlamuongna lungril a ni lem."
12,"And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.","Chun, kei chu mi hung ko in ta, fêng in ta, ka kuoma chun ṭawngṭai in ta, chun, kei khawma lo ngai ka ti cheu."
13,"And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.","Mi zawng in ta, in lungril po poa in mi zawng pha chun mi hmûng in tih."
14,"And I will be found of you, saith Jehovah, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.","Nangni ihmuin um ka ta, LALPA chun a tih: chuongchun, in sal intângna chu inlet ka ta, ka hnawt hmangna cheu hmun po poa inthawk le, hnam po pohaia inthawk chun ṭhuoi khâwm ka ti cheu a, LALPA chun a tih; chun, sala intâng dinga ṭhuoi hmanga kân umtirna cheu hmuna bawk khan hung ṭhuoi kîr nâwk ka ti cheu."
15,"Because ye have said, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;","“LALPA chun Babulona khawm chun zâwlneihai a hung siem tah a,” in ti leiin,"
16,"thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;","David lalṭhungphaa ṭhung lal chungthua le, chu khawpuia mipui chêng po pohai, in unauhai nangni le sala intâng dinga fe ve nawhai chung- thua chun LALPAIN hieng hin a tih:"
17,"thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.","sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, an chunga chun kâwlhnâm dâm, ṭâm dâm, hripui dâm tir ka ta, anni chu theichang hrût, an siet êm leia fâk thei lohai anga chun siem ka tih."
18,"And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them;","Chun, anni chu kâwlhnâm le ṭâm le hriin hnawt ka ta, anni ka tir hmangna tieng hnamhai po po laia chun thusekawk ding le, inchekna ding le, makti ding le, mi ṭawng- dâwng dingin hnuoia lalram po po laia hnungtieng hmatienga nawr- lênga um dingin pe suok ka tih;"
19,"because they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jehovah, wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith Jehovah.","anni chun ka thu an ngai naw leiin, LALPA chun a tih; inhmataka thoa anni tirin, ka siehlaw zâwlnei- hai chu an kuomah ka tir a; nisien- lakhawm, anni chu in lo ngai si nawh, LALPA chun a tih."
20,"Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.","Chuleichun, nangni sala intâng, Jerusalema inthawka Babulona ka tir po pohai, LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u."
21,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie unto you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;","Ka hminga in kuoma thukhêl hriltu Maaseia naupa Zedekia chung thua le, Kolaia naupa Ahab chung- thua chun Israel Pathien, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, anni chu Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzar kuta chun pe suok ka ta, ama chun in mithmuah anni chu that a tih;"
22,"and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;","Babulona Juda sal intânghai po po chun, “Zedekia le Ahab, Babulon lalin a rawhai ang chun LALPA chun siem raw se che,” tiin, anni chung- thua chun ṭawngse inphurna takah hmang an tih:"
23,"because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith Jehovah.","Israel rama chun invêtthlâk- takin thil an thawh a, an tuolbâwm- hai nuhmei le chun an uireh a, ka hming sâlin ka thupêk loa khêl thu an hril leiin; chun, kei chu a hretu, a hrietpuitu chu ka nih, LALPA chun a tih."
24,"And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying,","Chun, Nehelam mi Semaia chungthua chun hieng ang hin thu hril i tih:"
25,"Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,","Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Jerusalema mi- pui um po pohai, thiempu Masseia naupa Zephania kuoma leh, thiem- puhai po po kuoma chun hieng anga nangma hminga lekha i thawn leiin:"
26,"Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles.","“Thiempu Jehoiada aia chun LALPA chun thiempuah a siem ta cheh a, chuongchun, LALPA ina chun hotu nîng i ta, chun, mi tukhawm ân vêt a, ama le ama zâwlneia ân siem chun, ama chu intângna ina siein, kawl inbuntir i tih."
27,"Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you,","Chuleiin, tuhin ieng dinga Ana- thotha mi Jeremia in kuoma zâwlnei inti hi i kâwk naw am a na?"
28,"forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?","ama chun, ‘Sal intâng sûng ding hi a sâwt a, inhai bâwl unla, a sûnga- hai chun chêng unla, huonhai siem unla, a rahai chu fa ro,’ tiin Babulon- ah thu a mi thawn si a” tiin."
29,And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.,"Chun, thiempu Zephania chun zâwlnei Jeremia na hrieta chun hi lekhathawn hi a tiem tah a."
30,"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, Jeremia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:"
31,"Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie;","“Sal intânghai po po kuoma chun mi tir la. Nehelam mi Semaia chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng- hin a tih: Semaia chu ka tir loin, in kuoma chun thu hrilin, thukhêl chu a hung inawitir cheu leiin,"
32,"therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto my people, saith Jehovah, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, Nehelam mi Semaia le a thlahai chu hrem ka ta; hi hnam laia chêng ding hi mi nei naw nih a, ka mihai laia thil ṭha ka thaw khawm chu hmu bawk naw ni, LALPA chun a tih: LALPA chunga helna thu a lo hril ta leiin,” tiin."
