1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,","Chun, sipai hotuhai po po, Karea naupa Johanan hai, Hosaia naupa Jezania hai, mipui po po a chîn taka inthawka a lien tak chenin an hung hnai a,"
2,"and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray thee, our supplication be presented before thee, and pray for us unto Jehovah thy God, even for all this remnant (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us),","zâwlnei Jeremia kuoma chun hieng hin an hril a, “Kan ngên che hi, kan hninahai hi i hmaa chun pawm ni raw se; hieng tuta la mahlahai po po ta ding hin, LALPA i Pathien kuoma chun kan ta dingin ṭawngṭai rawh; i mitin a hmu chie ang hin, tamtak kha tlâwmte chau hi hlain kan um a nih;"
3,"that Jehovah thy God may show us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.","LALPA i Pathien chun thil kan thaw ding le, lampui kan hraw ding chu a mîn hriettir theina dingin,” tiin."
4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.","Chun, zâwlnei Jeremia chun an kuomah, “In thu chu ka hriet tah a; ngai ta u, LALPA in Pathien kuoma chun in thuhai ang peiin ṭawngṭai ka tih; chun, thil iengkhawma LALPAIN a hung dawnna cheu chu in kuomah hrilfieng ka tih, iengkhawm in kuomah ip naw ning,” a ta."
5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not according to all the word wherewith Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.","Anni chun Jeremia kuoma chu, “LALPA i Pathienin kan kuoma a hung tirna ang thu po pohai anga kan thaw naw chun, LALPA chu eini laia hrietpuitu ringum le indik ni raw se."
6,"Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.","A ṭha amanih, a sie amanih khawm ni sienla, LALPA kan Pathien kan itirna che chu a râwl chu ngai kan tih; LALPA kan Pathien râwl chu kan awi pha chun, keini ta dinga a ṭhatna dingin,” an ta."
7,"And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.","Chun, ni sâwm hnunga chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuoma chun a hung tlung tah a."
8,"Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,","Ama chun Karea naupa Johanan le, an kuoma um sipai hotuhai po po le, mi po po a chîn taka inthawka a lien tak chenin a ko a."
9,"and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:","an kuomah a hril a, “A hmaa in hninahai chu intlun dinga in mi tirna, LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih:"
10,"If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.","Hi rama hin in chêng zing chun, rem ka ti cheu a, ṭhiek naw ning cheu, phun ka ti cheu a, phawidawk naw ning cheu, in kuoma thil ṭha naw ka thaw kha ka lamlêt ta sih a."
11,"Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.","In iṭitak Babulon lal chu ṭi naw unla, ama chu ṭi naw ro, LALPA chun a tih: a kuta inthawka sanhima san- dam ding cheuin kei in kuomah ka um zing sih a."
12,"And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.","Chun, zângaina phalpêk ka ti cheu a, in chungah zângaina a neia, in ram ngeiah ân kîrtir nâwkna ding cheuin."
13,"But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so that ye obey not the voice of Jehovah your God,","Amiruokchu, ‘Hi rama hin um zing nâwng ei tiu,’ in tih a, in Pathien LALPA râwl chu in awi naw a,"
14,"saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:","‘Ni lo, Aigupta ramah fe lem ei ta, chutaka chun indona hlak hmu nâwng ei ta, tawtawrâwt ri hlak hre nâwng ei ta, bei tlâksam hlak hre bawk nâwng ei ta, chutaka chun chêng ei tiu,’ ti in ni chun;"
15,"now therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, If ye indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;","Aw Juda la um sunhai, tuhin LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u; sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Aigupta rama lût dinga in hmaihai in innghat chieh a, chutaka va mikhuol dinga in fe chun;"
16,"then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.","hieng hi hung nîng a tih: chu Aigupta rama chun kâwlhnâm in ṭi hlak khan hung hnawt phâk a ti cheu a, ṭâm in iṭi khan chu Aigupta rama chun a hung hnawt rak rak ding cheu a nih; chuongchun, chutaka chun thîng in tih."
17,"So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.","Va mikhuol dinga Aiguptaa fe dinga an hmaihai innghat chie chuong mihai po po chu chuong ang chu nîng an tih; kâwlhnâmah thîng an ta; ṭâm le hripuia leh; an chunga thil ṭha naw ka hung intlungtir dinga inthawk chun tukhawm suokthlengin amanih, tukhawm um zing naw ni hai."
18,"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.","Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Jerusalem hluotuhai chunga ka lunginsenna le ka ṭiumna bunthlâka a um ang khan; Aigupta rama in lût pha chun ka ṭiumna chu in chunga chun bunthlâk ni vêng a tih; chuongchun, hnâwm- hnawk le, makti ding le, ṭawngsephur le, thusekawk nîng in ta, hi hmun hi hmu nâwk ta ngai naw ti niu."
19,"Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified unto you this day.","Aw Juda la um sunhai, nangni chungthuah LALPA chun thu a hril a nih: Aiguptaa chu fe dêr naw ro: vawisûn hin in kuomah ka hrilfie ta a nih ti hi hre ngei ngei ro."
20,"For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our God; and according unto all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.","In thlarauhai chunga chun hmusitumtakin in lo thaw tah a; ‘LALPA kan Pathien kuoma chun mi ṭawngṭaipêk la, LALPA kan Pathien- in a hril ang ang che chu kan kuomah hrilfie la, thâwng kan tih,’ tiin LALPA in Pathien kuoma chun in mi tir ta sih a,"
21,And I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me unto you.,"vawisûn hin in kuomah ka hrilfie tah a, nisienlakhawm, in kuoma a mi hung tirna ang thil ienga khawm chun LALPA in Pathien râwl chu in awi si nawh a."
22,"Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.","Chuleiin, tuhin, chutaka va mi- khuol in nuomna hmuna chun, kâwl- hnâm le, ṭâm le hripuiin thîng in tih ti hi hre ngei ngei ro,” tiin."
