9,"He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and passeth over to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.","Tukhawm hi khawpui sûnga um chu kâwlhnâmin, ṭâmin, hripuiin thîng a ta, amiruokchu, mi fe suok a, mi ân huoltuhai cheu Kaldaihai kuoma vân pe chu hring a ta, a hringna chu indona Lâwmman angin nei a tih."
