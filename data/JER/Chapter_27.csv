1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,","Juda lal Josia naupa Jehoia- kim rorêl ṭantir lai chun LALPA kuoma inthawkin hi thu hi Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung a,"
2,"Thus saith Jehovah to me: Make thee bonds and bars, and put them upon thy neck;","“LALPA chun ka kuoma chun hieng hin a tih: Rîngkawlhai le a hnamhai i ta dingin siem la, i rînga chun bât rawh;"
3,"and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah:","Edom lal dâm, Moab lal dâm, Ammon thlahai lal dâm, Tura lal dâm, Zidon lal dâm kuoma chun Juda lal Zedekia kuoma Jerusalema hunghai thangkohai kuta chun inphur rawh;"
4,"and give them a charge unto their masters, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say unto your masters:","an hotuhai kuoma chun thuneina pe la, hienghin ti rawh, ‘Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: In hotuhai kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril in tih:"
5,"I have made the earth, the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me.","ka bân phar le ka thilthawtheina nasatak chun hnuoi phêk chunga ramsahai le mihriem le leihnuoi chu ka siem a; chun, ka ngaia pêk ding âwm kuoma chun ka pêk tah a."
6,"And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him.","Tuhin chuong ramhai po po chu ka siehlaw Nebukadnezzar, Babulon lal kuoma chun ka pêk tah a nih, ramhnuoia ramsahai khawm chu ama rawng bâwl dingin ka pêk a nih."
7,"And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman.","Chuongchun, ama ram ngei a ni hun a tlung hmakhat chun, hnamhai chun ama le a naupasal le, a naupasal naupa rawng chu bâwl an tih; chuongchun, hnam tamtakhai le lal ropuitakhai chun ama chu suokin man an tih."
8,"And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith Jehovah, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.","Chun, hnam le lalram Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar rawng bâwl lohai le, Babulon lal rîngkawl hnuoia an rîng sie nuom lohai chu, LALPA chun a tih; ama kut ngeia ka sukbohmang vawng hmakhat chun, anni chu hripui dâm, ṭâm dâm, kâwlhnâm dâmin hrem ka tih."
9,"But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:","Nisienlakhawm, nangni chung- thu ruoka chun, in zâwlneihai, in khawhri zâwlhai, in manghai, in dawithiemhai, in aisân thiemhai “Babulon lal rawng chu bâwl naw ti niu,” tituhai chu ngai naw ro;"
10,"for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.","in rama inthawka hlataka sawnhmang ding cheuin anni chun khêlthu an hril cheu a ni sih a; nangni chu ka hnawt suok cheu a, in bo- hmangna dingin."
11,"But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation will I let remain in their own land, saith Jehovah; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.","Amiruokchu, Babulon lal rîng- kawl hnuoia an rîng dawh a, ama rawngbâwltuhai chu hnam ngei chu an rama chun inumtir zing ka tih, LALPA chun a tih; inlêt an ta, chêng zing an tih,’” tiin."
12,"And I spake to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.","Chun, hieng thuhai ang tak hin Juda lal Zedekia kuoma chun thu ka hril a, “Babulon lal rîngkawl hnuoia chun in rînghai hung daw unla, ama le a mihai rawng chu bâwl unla, hringin um ro."
13,"Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?","Babulon lal rawng bâwl lo ding hnam chungthua LALPAIN a lo hril ta angin, ieng dingin am nang le i mihai chu hripui dâmin, ṭâmin le kawlhnâma dâm chun thîng in ta?"
14,"And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.","In kuoma ‘Babulon lal rawng chu in bâwl ding a ni nawh,’ titu zâwlneihai thu chu ngai naw ro: in kuoma chun thukhêl an hril sih a."
15,"For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.","LALPA chun a tih: Anni chu ka tir si nawh a, nisienlakhawm, ka hmingin thukhêl chu an hril a nih; nangni chu ka hnawt suok theina ding cheu le, nangni le zâwlnei in kuoma thuhriltuhai chu in bohmang theina dingin,” tiin."
16,"Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.","Thiempuhai le hi hnam po pohai kuoma chun hieng hin ka hril bawk a, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: In kuomah, ‘Ngai ta u, LALPA bûr le bêlhai chu Babulona inthawkin sâwt- nawtêa hung lâk nîng an tih,’ titu in zâwlneihai thu chu ngai naw ro; in kuomah thukhêl an hril a ni sih a."
17,"Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation?","Anni thu chu ngai naw unla, Babulon lal rawng chu bâwl unla, damin um ro, ieng dingin am hi khawpui hi râusanin um el a ta?"
18,"But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.","Amiruokchu, zâwlnei an nia, an kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a um chun, tuhin sipaihai LALPA kuoma chun hnina siem hai sienla, LALPA ina bûr le bêl mâksana la umhai le, Jerusalem le lal ina mâksana la umhai chu Babulona a fe ve nawna dingin."
19,"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,","Sipaihai LALPA chun sûtpuihai chungthua le, châwtawl lien chung- thua le, ân ṭhutna chungthua le, khawpuia bûr le bêl mâksana la umhai chungthua chun, hieng hin a tih:"
20,"which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;",chuong Babulon lal Nebukad- nezzarin Juda lal Jehoiakim naupa Jekonia chu sala Jerusalema in- thawka Babulona Jerusalem le Juda rama mi ṭhahai po po chu sala a ṭhuoi laia a lâk sa ve nawhai chung- thu chu;
21,"yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:","anih, sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: LALPA ina bûr le bêl mâksana la umhai chungthua, Juda ram lal ina le Jerusalema mihai le chun sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih:"
22,"They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.","Babulona chun phur hmang nîng an ta, chutaka chun um an tih, anni ka va sir ni chen chun, LALPA chun a tih: chun, hung la nâwk tâwl ka ta, hi hmuna hin sie nâwk ka tih,” tiin."
