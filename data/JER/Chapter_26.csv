1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from Jehovah, saying,",Juda lal Josia naupa Jehoia- kim rorêl ṭantir laiin hi thu hi LALPA kuoma inthawkin a hung tlung a:
2,"Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovah’s house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Jehovah’s house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word.","“LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: LALPA in huon tuollaia chun ngîr la, an kuoma thuhril ding ka thupêk po po che chu, LALPA ina Pathien be dinga hung khâwm, Juda khawpui- hai po po kuoma chun hril rawh; thu khat chau khawm ip naw rawh."
3,"It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.","Anni chun ngai an ta, mi tin chu mâni lampui suola inthawk chun an kîr el thei a nih; chuongchun, an thilthawhai suol leia an chunga thil ṭhalo thaw dinga ka tumhai khawm chu kân sîr el thei a nih."
4,"And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,","Chun, an kuoma chun hieng hin tîng i ta: LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: in hmaa ka sie ka dân chu hraw dinga ka thu in ngai naw chun,"
5,"to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send unto you, even rising up early and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;","inhmataka thoa anni hung tira, ka siehlaw zâwlneihai in kuoma ka hungtirhai thuhai in ngai dinghai chu, in ngai ta nawh a;"
6,"then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.","chuongchun, hi in hi Silo angah siem ka ta, hi khawpui hi hnuoia hnam po pohai ṭawngse hnâwknaah siem bawk ka tih,” tiin."
7,And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.,"Chun, thiempuhai, zâwlneihai le mi po po chun hieng thuhai hi LALPA ina Jeremia chun a hril chu an hriet a."
8,"And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.","Chun, LALPAIN hril dinga thu a pêk po po mipuihai po po kuoma Jeremia chun a hril zo chun, thiem- puhai le, zâwlneihai le mipui po po chun ama chu an man a, “I thi ngei ngei ding a nih."
9,"Why hast thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered unto Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.","Iengdinga LALPA hminga thu hrila, ‘Hi in hi Silo ang nîng a ta, hi khawpui hi hluotu um loa rausan nîng a tih,’ i ti am a na?” an tih a. Chuongchun, LALPA ina chun Jeremia chu mipui po po chun an bâwr ta hut hut a."
10,"And when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house unto the house of Jehovah; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Jehovah’s house.","Juda ram lalhai chu chuong thuhai chu an lo hriet chun, lal ina inthawk chun LALPA ina chun an hung tâwl a; chuongchun, LALPA in dai kawtkhâr thar lûtnaa chun an ṭhung tâwl a."
11,"Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.","Chun, thiempuhai le zâwlneihai chun lalhai le mipuihai po po kuoma chun, “Hi mipa hi thi tlâk a nih, in nahaia in hriet ta ang ngei khan hi khawpui siet ding thu a hril a nih,” tiin an hril a."
12,"Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.","Chun, Jeremia chun lalhai po po le mipuihai po po kuoma chun thu a hril tah a, “LALPA chun thu in lo hriet ta ang po po khan hi khawpui le hi in siet ding thu hril dingin a mi hung tir a nih."
13,"Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.","Chuleiin, tuhin in thilthawhai le in umdânhai chu siemṭha unla, LALPA in Pathien râwl chu awi ro; chuongchun, nangni dodâla LALPA- IN thil ṭha naw a lo hril ta khawm chu lamlêt a tih."
14,"But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes.","Chun, keia chungchâng thua chun, in kutah ka um a nih, in mithmua ṭha le ân dik ang chun ka chungah thaw el ro."
15,"Only know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.","Hi hi hre ngei unla, kei in mi sukhlum chun, nangni chunga le, hi khawpui chunga le, chu chu hluo- tuhai chunga chun mi thiem thisen chu in intlungtir ngei ding a nih; thil dikah, LALPA chun in na hrieta hieng thuhai po po hi hril dingin in kuomah a mi hung tir a ni sih a,” tiin."
16,Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.,"Chun, lalhai le mipuihai po po chun zâwlneihai le thiempuhai kuoma chun, “Hi mipa hi thi tlâk a ni naw ie; ama hi LALPA ei Pathien hmingin thu a hril a ni sih a,” an tih a."
17,"Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,","Chun, chu rama upa ṭhenkhat- hai chu an tho a, mipui inkhâwmhai po po kuoma chun thu an hril tah a,"
18,"Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.","“Moras mi Mikaia khan Juda ram lal Hezekia inlal laiin thu a hril a; Juda rama mi po pohai kuoma chun ‘Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Zion chu lo anga inlet nîng a ta; Jerusalem chu hmunhnawk sie- khâwm nîng a ta, in hmun tlâng chu ramhnuoia bâwlhmun tlâng ang nîng a tih,’ tiin."
19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat the favor of Jehovah, and Jehovah repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.","Juda ram lal Hezekia le, Juda mihai po po chun ama chu an that el am a nih? LALPA chu a ṭih a, LALPA ditsakna chu a hnih a; chuongchun, LALPA chun an chunga thil ṭha naw a lo hril ta kha a lamlêt a ni nâwm a ni kha? Chuong a ni chun eini thlatuhai ta ding ngeiin thil ṭha nawtak ei thaw a ni ding a nih,” an tih a."
20,"And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.","Chun, mi pakhat, LALPA hminga thuhriltu, Kiriath-Jearima Semaia naupa Uria chu a um a, ama khawm chun Jeremia thu ang tak pei chun hi ram le hi khawpui siet ding thu a hril veh a;"
21,"And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt.","chun, lal Jehoiakim le, a mi hrâthai po po le, lalhai po poin a hril an hriet chun lal chun ama chu sukhlum a tum tah a; nisienla- khawm, Uria chun a lo hriet chun a ṭih a, a tlân a, Aigupta rama chun a fe tah a;"
22,"And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt;","chun, lal Jehoiakim chun Aigupta rama chun mihai a tir a, Akbor naupa Elnathan le mi ṭhen- khat chu Aiguptaa chun a tir a;"
23,"and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.","Aigupta rama inthawk chun Uria chu an hung ṭhuoi a, lal Jehoia- kim kuoma chun an hung ṭhuoi tah a, chun, ama chun kâwlhnâmin a that a, a ruong chu mi narânhai thlâna chun a pei lût a."
24,"But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.","Nisienlakhawm, Saphan naupa Ahikam kut chu Jeremia kuoma chun a um a, ama chu that dinga mipui kuoma an pêk nawna dingin."
