1,"And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,","Chun, Juda ram lal Zedekia rorêl ṭantir, a kum lina, a thla ngana, chu kum ma chun zâwlnei Azzur naupa Hanania, Gibeon mi chun, mipuihai po po le thiempuhai hmaihmaah, LALPA ina chun ka kuomah hieng hin thu a hril a,"
2,"Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.",“Israel Pathien sipaihai LALPA chun hienghin a tih: Babulon lal rîngkawl chu ka sukthliek tah a.
3,"Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:","Kum hni pumhlûm sûngin LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai po po Babulon lal Nebukadnezzarin hi hmuna inthawka a lâk a, Babulona a phurhai kha hi hmuna hin hung la kîr nâwk vawng ka ta;"
4,"and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.","hi hmuna hin Juda ram lal Jehoiakim naupa Jekonia le Juda sal intânghai po po Babulona fe tahai chu hung ṭhuoi kîr nâwk ka ta; LALPA chun a tih; Babulon lal rîngkawl chu ka sukthliek ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah,","Chun, thiempuhai, mipui po po LALPA ina ngîrhai kuoma chun zâwlnei Jeremia chun zâwlnei Hanania kuomah,"
6,"even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Jehovah do so; Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Jehovah’s house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon unto this place.","zâwlnei Jeremia ngei chun a hril a, “Amen: LALPA chun chuong chun thaw raw se; Babulona inthawka hi hmuna, sala lo intânghai po po le, LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai chu hung la kîr dingin, i thuhril chu LALPA chun thaw raw se."
7,"Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:","Nisienlakhawm, mipui po po na hrieta le nangma na hriet ngeia hi thu ka hril hi tuhin lo ngai ta;"
8,"The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.","Zâwlnei keia hma le nangma hmaa, kha hmaa lo um tahai khan ram tamtak chunga le, lalram ropui- takhai chunga le, indo thu dâm, thil ṭha naw thu dâm, hripui thu dâm an lo hril hlak a."
9,"The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that Jehovah hath truly sent him.","Zâwlnei thlamuongna thu hriltu chu, chu zâwlnei thuhril chu a hung tlung pha chun, chu zâwlnei chu LALPA chun ama chu a tir taktak a nih ti hriet a nih,” tiin."
10,"Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.","Chun, zâwlnei Hanania chun zâwlnei Jeremia rînga rîngkawl chu a lâk a, a sukthliek tah a."
11,"And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.","Chun, Hanania chun mipuihai po po hmaihmaa chun thu a hril tah a, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hnam po pohai rînga inthawkin kum hni pumhlûm sûngin Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar rîngkawl chu hieng ang ngei hin ka sukthliek ding a nih, a tih,” a ta, zâwlnei Jeremia ruok chu a fe hmang tah a."
12,"Then the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, zâwlnei Hananiain zâwl- nei Jeremia rînga inthawka rîngkawl a sukthliek hnung chun Jeremia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu hieng ang hin a hung tlung a,"
13,"Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou hast made in their stead bars of iron.","“Fe la, Hanania chu hieng ang hin va hril rawh: LALPA chun hieng- hin a tih: Thinga siem rîngkawlhai chu i sukthliek a; amiruokchu, an aia chun thîrin rîngkawl i siem ding a nih."
14,"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.","Israel Pathien, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar rawng chu an bâwl theina dingin hieng hnam po pohai rînga hin thîr rîngkawl chu kân kawl- tir tah a nih; ama rawng chu bâwl an ta, ramhnuoia ram sahai chenin ama chu ka pêk tah a nih,” tiin."
15,"Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.","Chun, zâwlnei Jeremia chun zâwlnei Hanania kuoma chun, “Hanania, tuhin lo ngai ta, LALPA chun nang a tir naw cheh a, nisien- lakhawm, hi mipui hi khêlthu chu în ringtir a ni hi."
16,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against Jehovah.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, leihnuoi chunga in- thawk hin ka tir hmang ding che a nih; LALPA kala khêlthu i hril leiin, tu kum hin i thi ding a nih,” tiin."
17,So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.,"Chuongchun, zâwlnei Hanania chu chu kum ma thla sarinaa chun a thi tah a."
