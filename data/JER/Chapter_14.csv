1,The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.,Khawinṭhâl chungthua Jere- mia kuoma LALPA thu hung tlung chu:
2,"Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.","Juda chun a sûn a; chutaka a dai kawtkhârhai khawm chu an ṭâwp zo a, hnuoi chunga chun a duma inbelin ân ṭhung a; Jerusalem khêk ri chu chungtieng a feh a."
3,"And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads.","A miṭhahai chun an nauhai chu tui chawi dingin an tir a, khurahai chun an hung a, tui hlak an hmu nawh a; an tuitheihai chu a ruokin an kîr a, an inzakin an buoi a, an luhai chu an inkhum a."
4,"Because of the ground which is cracked, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads.","Rama chun ruotui a um si nawh a, leihnuoi beidawngumtak lei chun hnuoi inlettuhai chu an inzak a, an luhai an khum a."
5,"Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh her young, because there is no grass.","Anih, sazukpui khawm rama chun ân teh a, hlohna a um naw leiin a tê chu a mâksan a."
6,"And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.","Ram sabengtunghai khawm chu tlâng sâng chungahai chun an ngîr a, sihalhai angin thli an dawng a, hlo pet ding a um naw leiin an mit ân thim a."
7,"Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name’s sake, O Jehovah; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.","Kan suolnahai chun keini a mi hêk khawma, Aw LALPA, i hming leiin nangin sin thaw la, kan hnung- tawlnahai chu a tam hle ta sih a; i chunga chun thil kan lo suksuol ta a nih."
8,"O thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?","Aw nang Israel beisei, buoina hun laia sandamtu, hi rama hin ieng dingin am mikhuol ang chau, zân khat riek dinga inzin mi puon in zartu ang el chu nîng i ta?"
9,"Why shouldest thou be as a man affrighted, as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet thou, O Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.","Ieng dingin am mi maktia um, mi thilthawtheitak sandam thei silo ang chu nîng i ta? Nang chu, Aw LALPA, keini lai hin i um a, i hming chawia ko kan na; keini mi mâksan naw rawh."
10,"Thus saith Jehovah unto this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Jehovah doth not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.","LALPA chun hi mihai chung- thua chun hieng hin a tih: Invâk invâk hi an nuom zâwngtak a lo ni tah a: an kehai khawm an thunun nawh a; chuleiin, LALPA chun anni chu a pawm nawh a; tuhin an suol- nahai chu hre zing a ta, an suolhai lei chun anni chu hrem a tih."
11,"And Jehovah said unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuoma chun, “Hi hnam ta ding hin an ṭhatna dingin ṭawngṭaipêk naw rawh."
12,"When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.","Bu an nghei pha khawm, an khêkri chu ngai naw ning a; in- thâwina le pumrawhmang thilinhlân an inhlân pha khawm pawmpêk naw ningah; amiruokchu, anni chu kâwl- hnâm le, ṭâm le hripuiin sukbohmang lem ka tih” a ta."
13,"Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.","Chun, kei chun, “Aw LALPA Pathien, ngai ta, zâwlneihai chun an kuoma chun, ‘Kâwlhnâmhai chu hmu ngai naw ti niu a, ṭâm khawm nei ngai naw ti niu a, amiruokchu, hi hmuna hin thlamuongna diktak chu pêng ka ti cheu,’ an lo tipêk hlak a,” ka tih a;"
14,"Then Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart.","chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah a hril a, “Zâwlneihai chun ka hmingin thukhêlhai an hril a; anni chu ka tir nawh a, thu khawm ka pêk nawh a, an kuoma khawm thu ka hril bawk nawh; in kuoma chun thil hmulâwk indik nawhai, khawhri zâwl thuhai, thil iengkhawm ni lo, an lungrila thukhêl chu an hril lem hlak a."
15,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.","Chuleiin, ka hminga zâwlnei thuhriltuhai chungthua chun, LAL- PA chun hieng hin a tih: anni chu ka tir nawh a; amiruokchu, hi rama hin kâwlhnâm le ṭâm tla naw ni, tituhai, chuong zâwlneihai chu kâwlhnâm le ṭâmin sukbohmang nîng an tih."
16,"And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them—them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.","Chun, chuong mipuihai an thuhrilnahai chu ṭâmna le kâwlhnâm leiin Jerusalem kawtthlêrahai chun pei suokin um an ta; anni phûmtu ding tukhawm nei naw ni hai, anni leh, an nuhmeihai le an naupasalhai, an naunuhmeihai leh; anni chunga chun an rîtlona chu ka bunthlâk ding a ni sih a."
17,"And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.","Chun, an kuoma chun hieng thu hi hril rawh: Sûn le zâna khawm ka mithai chu mitthliin luong thla raw se; ma lo tawpin; ka chipui naunu inthieng chu hliemna nasatakin, pawpna nasataka suknawiin a um a."
18,"If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, they that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.","Ramhnuoiah ka va fe leh, kâwl- hnâma thihai hmu a na! khawpui sûng ka lût leh, ṭâmnaa na tuorhai hmu a na! zâwlneihai le thiempuhai chu ram sûnga chun an invâk vêl a, hrietna nei si loin,” tiin."
19,"Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!","Juda chu i hnâwl pumhlûm dêr am a nih? I thla chun Zion chu a tirdak am a nih? Iengdinga nangin i mi hrema, kan ta dinga sukdamna um lo am a na? Inremna kan enkai a, nisienlakhawm, thil ṭha hrim a hung tlung nawh a; sukdamna ding huna khawm chun lunginzîngna hmu a nih!"
20,"We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.","Aw LALPA, kan suolnahai ka hung inhriettir a, kan thlatuhai suolna leh; nangma chunga chun thil kan lo suksuol ta sih a."
21,"Do not abhor us, for thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.","Nangma hming leiin keini chu mi hmusit naw la, i ropuina lalṭhung- pha chu sukhmaimâwk naw rawh; keini le i thuthlung kha hre zing la, sukse naw rawh."
22,"Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O Jehovah our God? therefore we will wait for thee; for thou hast made all these things.","Khawhri be mihai teplohai lai chun ruo insûrtir thei hrim an um am? Annawleh, vânhai chun ruohai chu a pêk thei am a nih? Aw LALPA kan Pathien, nang chu ama chu i ni a ni naw maw? Chuleiin, nangma chu nghâk zing kan ti che, hieng thilhai po po hi i siem sih a."
