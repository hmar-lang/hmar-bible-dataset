1,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,",Chu nawa khawm vêngtu kulbînga khârkhum a ni sûng chun a vawi hninaah Jeremia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:
2,"Thus saith Jehovah that doeth it, Jehovah that formeth it to establish it; Jehovah is his name:","“LALPA a thawtu, indin dinga LALPA a siemtu chun hieng hin a tih: LALPA ti chu a hming a nih:"
3,"Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and will show thee great things, and difficult, which thou knowest not.","Kei mi hung ko la, lo dawn ka ti cheh a, thil ropui le inthup i hriet naw hai chu inentir ka ti che."
4,"For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defence against the mounds and against the sword;",Hi khawpui inhai chungthua le Juda ram lalhai in kâwlhnâm le hnuoi dêng pâwng lama inthawka dangna siemna dinga sukchima um- hai chungthua chun Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih:
5,"while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:","Kaldaihai chu do dingin an hung a, ka lunginthaknaa le ka lungin- sennaa ka that ding mi ruonghaia suksip dingin, an suolnahai po po leiin hi khawpuia inthawk ka hmai ka thup ta si a."
6,"Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth.","Ngai ta u, hrisêlna le sukdamna intlungtir ka ta, anni chu sukdam ka tih; chun, an kuoma chun thudik le thlamuongna tamtak chu suklang bawk ka tih."
7,"And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.","Juda sal intângna le Israel sal intângna chu inlamlêttir ka ta, a tîra ang khan anni chu rem ka tih."
8,"And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me.","An suolna po po, ka chunga an lo suksuolnahaia inthawk khan anni chu sukthieng ka ta, an bawsietnahai po po chu ngaidam ka ta, ka chunga an lo suksuolnahai le, ka chunga an lo bawsietnahai chu."
9,"And this city shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure unto it.","Chun, hnuoi chunga hnam po pohai, an chunga thil ṭha ka thaw po po hretuhai le, thil ṭha po po le thlamuongna po po a ta dinga kân neitir hretuhai ṭiin inthin an tih; ka ta dingin hi khawpui hi hlimna hming le, inpâkna ding le ropuina ding hung nîng a tih."
10,"Thus saith Jehovah: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, whereof ye say, It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,","“LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ‘Sa le mihriem khawm um loin a sie a,’ in ti, hi hmuna le, Juda ram khawpui- haia le, hluotu um loa, ran khawm um loa râusan Jerusalem kawtthlêrahai chun hieng hi hriet la nîng a tih:"
11,"the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say, Give thanks to Jehovah of hosts, for Jehovah is good, for his lovingkindness endureth for ever; and of them that bring sacrifices of thanksgiving into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith Jehovah.","hlimna râwl dâm, lâwmna râwl dâm, moneitu râwl dâm, mo le, ‘Sipaihai LALPA kuoma chun lâwmthu hril ro, LALPA chu a ṭha sih a; a zainêmna chu kumkhuoin um zing a tih,’ tituhai râwl le, LALPA ina lâwmthu hrilna inthâwinahai hung chawituhai râwl ri chu. Hi ram sal intângna hi a tîr ang khan ka lamlêt ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
12,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Chu nawa khawm, hi hmuna hin, mihriem le sa khawm um loa se ta le chutaka khawpuihaia po po chun, berâmpuhai an ran ruol chu inbawktirin la um an tih."
13,"In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that numbereth them, saith Jehovah.","Tlângrama khawpuiahai le, phairuoma khawpuiahai le, Sima khawpuiahai le, Benjamin rama khawpuiahai le, Jerusalem vêl hmun- ahai le, Juda khawpuiahai chun berâm ruolhai chu anni tiemtu kut hnuoiah la tla nâwk an tih, LALPA chun a tih:"
14,"Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.","“Ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung, LALPA chun a tih: Juda sûng- kuo chungthua le, Israel sûngkuo chungthua thil ṭha ka hril kha ka thaw ding a nih."
15,"In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.","Chuong nihaia le, chu huna chun, David kuoma chun felna Kau hung indâwntir ka ta, rama chun rorêlna le felna chu tir suok a tih."
16,"In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby she shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.","Chuong nihaia chun Juda chu sandam ni tâng a ta, Jerusalem khawm chu himtakin chêng tâng a tih: chun, ‘LALPA chu ei felna a nih,’ ti hi koa a umna ding hming chu ni ta bawk a tih."
17,For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;,"“LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Israel sûngkuo lalṭhungpha chung- a ṭhung ding, David chun mi tlasam ngai naw ni;"
18,"neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.","thiempu Levi mihai chun ka hmaa pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai, bu thilinhlânhai, châmchia inthâwi- na inhlân dingin mi tlasam bawk naw ni hai,” tiin."
19,"And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung a,"
20,"Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;","“LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: sûn le zân an huntaka um lo dinga ka sûn thuthlung le ka zân thuthlung hi in suksiet thei a ni chun,"
21,"then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.","chuong ang bawk chun a lalṭhungphaa ṭhung ding naupasal nei lo dingin ka siehlaw David le ka thuthlung khawm hi suksiet thei nîng a tih; ka rawngbâwltuhai, thiem- puhai le Levi mihai le thuthlunghai khawm chu."
22,"As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.","Vâna umhai chu tiem sêng an ni nawh a, tuisuoriet phaiphin chu inkhi ruol a ni naw ang bawkin; ka siehlaw David chithla chu sukpung ka ta, keia ta dinga rawngbâwltu Levi mihai le chun” tiin."
23,"And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, Jeremia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a,"
24,"Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah did choose, he hath cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.","“Hi mi, Hnam pahni LALPA thlanghai chu, anni chu a pei thlâk tah, tituhai chu ngaituo naw rawh; chuongchun, anni hmaa hnam hrim an ni ta nawna dingin, anni chun ka mihai chu an hmusit a nih."
25,"Thus saith Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night stand not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Zân le sûn dinga ka thuthlung hi a um zing nawha, hnuoi le vâna thil ruota umhai chu ka sukdet naw chun,"
26,"then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.","Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai thlahai chunga rorêltuhai ding ka lâk nawna dingin, ka siehlaw David le Jakob thla chu peihâwn vêng ka tih; an sal intângna chu kân kîrtir ding a na, an chunga chun zângaina ka nei ding a ni sih a” tiin."
