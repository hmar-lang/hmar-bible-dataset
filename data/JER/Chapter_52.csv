1,Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.,"Zedekia chu rorêl a ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pakhat mi a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmpakhat sûng ro a rêl a; a nu hming chu, Libnaa Jeremia naunu Hamutal a nih."
2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.","Chun, ama chun LALPA mit- hmua thil ṭha naw chu a thawh a, Jehoiakimin a thaw ang chie el kha."
3,"For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.",LALPA lunginsenna leia anni chu Juda le Jerusalema a hmaihmaa inthawka anni a pei suok hmakhat chun Zedekia chu Babulon lal chungah a hel zing a.
4,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.","Chun, a rorêl kum kuona, thla sâwmnaa, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar le, a si- paihai po po chu Jerusalem do ding chun an hung a, an umngha tah a; a vêl ela chun kulhai an bâwl khum tah a."
5,So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.,"Chuongchun, khawpui chu lal Zedekia inlal kum sâwm pakhatna chen inhuolin a um a."
6,"In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.","A thla linaa, chu thla ni kuo ni chun khawpui sûnga ṭâmna chu a nasa ta êm êm a; chu rama mipuihai ta ding chun bei hrim a um ta nawh a."
7,"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and they went toward the Arabah.","Chun, khawpuia chun lamrel siem a ni tah a, lal huon sîra, bang pahnihai inkâra dai kawtkhâr lam- puia chun zânah indo mihai po po chu an tlân suok tah a (chuongchun, Kal- daihai chun khawpui chu a vêlin an umngha a na) Araba tieng lampuia chun an fe tah a."
8,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.","Nisienlakhawm, Kaldai sipaihai chun lal chu an hnawt tah a, Jeriko phairuoma chun Zedekia chu an va hnawt phâk tah a; chuongchun, a sipaihai po po chun ama chu an indar san tah a."
9,"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.","Chun, lal chu an man a, Hamath rama Riblaa chun Babulon lal kuoma chun an ṭhuoi tah a; chun, ama chun a chungthu a lo rêlthlûk tah a."
10,And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.,"Chun, Babulon lal chun a mit- hmu ngeia chun Zedekia naupasalhai chu a that tah a; chun, Riblaa chun Juda ram lalhai po po chu a that vawng bawk a."
11,"And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.","Chun, Zedekia mithai chu a kheldawkpêk a, Babulon lal chun ama chu thîrkawl ân buntir a, Babu- lon tieng a ṭhuoi a, a thi ni chenin lung inah a sie tah a."
12,"Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem.","Chun, thla nganaa, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun, chu chu Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar inlal kum sâwm- pakuona a nih; vêngtu hotu Nebuza- radan lal hmaa ngîr hlak chu Jerusalema chun a hung a,"
13,"And he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned he with fire.","LALPA in le lal in chu a rawh a; Jerusalema in po pohai, in ropui takhai khawm chu meiin a raw tah a."
14,"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.","Chun, Kaldai sipaihai vêngtu pâwlhai la umhai po po chun Jerusalem kulbang chu a vêlin an sukchim tah a."
15,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.","Chuongchun, vêngtu pâwl hotu Nebuzaradan chun, mi rimsihai pâwl le, khawpuia a mahlaa mâksana la um pâwlhai le, hung inrelruhai, Babulon lal kuoma hung tlân lûthai le, mipui la um sunhai hrim hrim chu sal dingin a ṭhuoi tâwl a."
16,But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.,"Nisienlakhawm, Nebuzaradan chun chu rama mi inrim zuol taluohai chu lo neitu dinghaia le, grêp huon enkawltu dinghaiah a mâksan a."
17,"And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.","Chun, LALPA ina dârsen sût- puihai, dârsen maihûn le ân ṭhut- nahai LALPA ina umhai chu Kaldaihai chun an suknawi vawng a, a dârsenhai po po chu Babulon tieng chun an phur tah a."
18,"The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.","Chun, bêlhai, vutluohai, mei chepnahai, maihûnhai, thîrhaihaw- hai, bûr le bêl dârsena siemhai po po rawngbâwlnaa an hmang hlakhai chu an lâk hmang vawng a."
19,"And the cups, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls—that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,—the captain of the guard took away.","Chun, nohai, vutluohai, mai- hûnhai, bêlhai, chawtawlhai, rângka- chaka siemhai chu rângkachakin tangkaruoa siemhai chu tangka- ruoin, vengtu pâwl sipai hotu chun a lâk vawng a."
20,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah—the brass of all these vessels was without weight.","Sûtpui pahnihai, chawtawl pakhat, ân ṭhutna hnuoia dârsen bâwngchal sâwm le pahni LALPA in ta dinga lal Solomonin a siemhai chu: hieng bûr le bêl dârsenhai po po hi a bûk chin hrietlo an nih."
21,"And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.","Sûtpui chungthua chun, sûtpui pakhat seizie chu tawng sâwmpariet a nih; chun, tawng sâwmpahni vêl- tuok a nih; chu chu sazie chu kut bel li bawk a na, kawrawng a nih."
22,"And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates.","Chun, a chunga chun dâra siem a lubâwk a um a, a lubâwk pakhat insângzie chu tawng nga a na, a vêl chun lênkal le, theibufai chu a lubâwk chunga dârsena siem vawng a um a, chun, sûtpui pahnina khawm chun chuong ang bawk chu, theibu- faihai le chun a ni ve bawk a."
23,And there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.,A sîra chun theibufai chu sâwm- kuo le paruk an na; a lênkal chunga a vêla theibufai po po chu za a nih.
24,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:","Chun, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun thiempu laltak Seraia le, a dawttu Zephania le, kawtkhâr vêngtu pathum a ṭhuoi a;"
25,"and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the king’s face, that were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.","khawpui sûnga inthawk chun indo mihai enkawltu hotu a ṭhuoi bawk a; chun lal hmaa ngîr hlak, chu khawpuia hmua um mi pasari leh; indo mihai hotu ziektu, a ram mihai hming ziektu, le khawpui sûnga mi hmua um chu ram mi sâwmruk leh a ṭhuoi a."
26,"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.","Chun, Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun anni chu a ṭhuoi a, Babulon lal kuomah Riblaa chun a hung ṭhuoi tâwl a."
27,"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.","Babulon lal chun anni chu a hrem a, Hamath rama Riblaa chun anni chu a that tâwl tah a. Chuong- chun, a rama inthawk chun Juda chu sala intâng dinga ṭhuoi a ni tah a."
28,This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty;,Hienghai hi Nebukadnezzarin sala intâng dinga a ṭhuoihai chu an nih: kum sari kum chun Juda mi sâng thum le sâwmhni pathum;
29,in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons;,Nebukadnezzar inlal kum sâwmpariet kum chun Jerusalema inthawkin mi za riet le sâwmthum pahni a ṭhuoi a;
30,in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.,"Nebukadnezzar inlal kum sâwmhni pathum kum chun Nebuza- radan, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun Juda mi sala intâng ding chu za sari, sâwmli panga a ṭhuoi a; chuongchun, mihriem po po chu sâng li le za ruk an nih.Jehoiakin insuoa a um thu le Babulona chawisânga a um thu (2 Lal 25.27-30)"
31,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;","Chun, Juda ram lal Jehoiakin sala ân tâng kum sâwmthum pasa- rina, thla sâwm pahnina, chu thla ni sâwmhni panga ni chun Evil- merodak Babulon lal ân lal kum, kum khatnaa chun Juda lal Jehoiakin lu chu a dawm kâng a, lung ina inthawk chun a hung ṭhuoi suok tah a;"
32,"and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,","a kuoma chun ngilneitakin thu a hril a, a lalṭhungpha chu Babulona lal um mi danghai nêka insânga chun a siepêk a."
33,and changed his prison garments. And Jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:,"Chun, a lung in intângna silfênhai chu a thlengpêk a, a kuoma chun ni tinin a dam sûng po chu bu a fâk ve hlak a."
34,"and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.","Chun, a hlaw ding khawm Babulon lal chun a pêk zing a, a dam sûng nihai po poa chun, a thi hma- khat chun ni tin a chanpuol a pêk a."
