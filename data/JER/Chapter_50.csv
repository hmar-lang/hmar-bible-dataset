2,"Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.","“Hnamhai laia chun hril la, phuong rawh, chun, puonzâr chu khai la, phuong la, thup naw rawh, ‘Babulon chu lâkin a um a, Bêl chu sukzak a na, Merodak chu a bei- dawng a, a milimhai po po chu sukzakin an um a, a milimhai chu an beidawng zo tah,’ ti rawh."
3,"For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast.","Hmârtienga inthawk chun hnam pakhat a ram chu râusana siema tukhawm chêng lo dinga siem dingin a hung mêk a; an tlânseh a, mihriem le ramsahai khawm chu, an fe hmang zo tah a."
4,"In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God.","Chuong niahai chun, chuong hunahai chun, LALPA chun a tih: Israel thlahai chu hung an ta, anni le Juda thlahai chu a ruolin hung an ta; an ṭap malamin hung an ta, LALPA an Pathien chu zawng an tih."

6,My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.,"“Ka mihai chu berâm inhmang- hai an lo ni tah a, an vêngtuhai chun anni chu tlângahai chun inherhmang- tirin, an ṭhuoi hmang a; tlânga in- thawkin muola dâm chun an fe a, an riekna hmun chu an theinghil tah a."
7,"All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.","A hmu taphawthai hlak chun anni chu an fâkzo a, an hmêlmahai chun, ‘Thudik umna LALPA, an thla- tuhai beiseitak, LALPA chunga chun thil an suksuol lei a nih, ei sukpawi nawh,’ an tih a."
8,"Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.","Babulona inthawk chun tlânsuok unla, Kaldaihai rama inthawk chun fe suok unla, kêl ruol hmaa kêlchal ang ni ro."
9,"For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.","Ngai ta u, hmârtieng rama inthawka hnam ropuitak inkhâwm chu Babulon hung rûn dingin hung chawktho ka ta, in hungtir ka tih; a chunga chun hung intlar an ta; chutaka inthawk chun lâkin um a ta, an thalhai chu mi hrât indo thiemtak a thlâwna kîr nâwk ngai naw ang a nih."
10,"And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Kaldai chu râllâk- sum hung nîng a ta, ama suksetuhai taphawt chu lungawi êm êm an tih, LALPA chun a tih."
11,"Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out the grain, and neigh as strong horses;","Aw nangni ka rochan hung rûntuhai, in hlima in lâwm lei le, sazukpui bu chilse a, sakawr hrâttak inhrâm anga in tha a fân leiin; in nu chu nasatakin inzak a tih;"
12,"your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.","nangni neitu cheu chu buoi a ta, ngai ta u, hnam po poa hnuoihnung tak, thlalêr le, ram ṭâwl le fienriel hmun nîng a tih."
13,"Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.","LALPA lunginsenna lei chun hluoin um naw nih a, a pumpuia râusan nîng a ta, mi tin Babulon fekhêltuhai phawt chun mak tîng an ta, a sietna po poa chun inchek an tih."
14,"Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah.","Babulon chu a vêlin nangni khawma intlar khum ro, thalngul kuoituhai, ama chu kâp unla, thal chu ren naw ro, LALPA chungah thil a lo suksuol ta sih a."
15,"Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.","A vêlin ama chu khêkkhum unla; ama chu a hung inpêklût tah a, a kulhai chu a chim a, a banghai chu sukchim an na. Lalpa phubalâkna a ni sih a; ama chunga chun phuba la unla, amain a lo thaw ta ang khan a chunga khawm thaw ve ro."
16,"Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.","Babulona inthawk chu chi thetu chu sât thla unla, busîk laia kâwite hmangtu le chun; nêksâwrna kâwl- hnâm ṭi leiin mi tin chu mâni mihai tiengah kîr seng an ta, mi tin chu mâni rama seng chun tlân an tih."
17,"Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.",“Israel chu berâm indar a nih: sakeibakneihai chun ama chu an lo hnawt hmang tah a; a hmasatak chun Assuria lal chun anni chu a fâkzo a; a tâwpah Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar hin a ruhai chu a sukthliek tah a.
18,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.","Chuleiin, sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, Assuria lal ka hrem ang bawk khan Babulon lal le a ram chu ka hrem ding a nih."
19,"And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.","Israel chu a tlatna hmuna chun hung ṭhuoi nâwk ka ta, Karmel le Basana chun tlâng a ta, a thla chu Ephraim le Gilead tlângahai chun lungawi tâwk tâng a tih."
20,"In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.","Chuong niahai chun, chuong pha chun, LALPA chun a tih: Israel suolna chu zawng nîng a ta, ieng- khawm um naw ni; chun, Juda suolna khawm chu hmu ni ta naw nih a; a mahla anga ka hla tahai chu ka ngaidam ding a ni sih a."
21,"Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.","“Merathaim ram chu, chu ngei chu, Pekod hluotuhai le chun hang rûn ro; anni chu that unla, sukbo- hmang vawng ro, LALPA chun a tih: thu ka pêk ang tak cheu chun thaw unla."
22,"A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.","Suksietna ropuitak le, indona ri chu rama chun a um a."

24,"I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Jehovah.","I ta dingin châng ka kam a, i âwk a ni tah, aw Babulon, i lo inring nawh a, LALPA chu i kal leiin hmu suokin i um a, manin i um an tah."
25,"Jehovah hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.","LALPA chun a râlthuom sie- khâwmna chu a hawng a, a lungin- senna hriemhreihai chu a hung lâk suok a, LALPA sipaihai LALPA chun Kaldaihai rama chun thaw ding a nei sih a."
26,"Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.","Kil tina inthawk chun ama chu hung rûn unla, a siekhâwmna inhai chu hawng unla, ama chu pil dêng pâwng angin dêng pâwng unla, sukse letdêr ro; a ieng iengkhawm hlain um naw raw se."
27,"Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.","A bâwngchalhai po po chu that vawng unla, sa thattu kuomah infetir ro; an chung a va rik de! an ni, anni hung hremna hun chu a hung tlung ta sih a. Babulon rama inthawka tlân- sea suokthlenghai râwlhai chu e!"
28,"The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.",“LALPA ei Pathien phubalâkna a biekin phubalâkna ngei chu Ziona hril ding a nih.
29,"Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.","“Thalkâptuhai, thalngul kuoi- hai po po chu Babulon chunga chun ko khâwm ro; a vêl el chun riekngha unla, chutaka inthawk chun tu- khawm insuokthlengtir naw ro; a sinthaw ang pei chun ama chu thung unla, a lo thaw ta ang tak khan ama chungah thaw ve ro; LALPA chungah, Israel Mi Inthieng chunga chun a lo chapo ta sih a."
30,"Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah.","Chuleiin, a tlangvâlhai chu a kawtthlêrahai chun tlûng an ta; chu ni chun a mi indo mihai po po khawm chu sukto ṭawk ṭawk nîng an tih, LALPA chun a tih."
31,"Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.","Ngai ta, nang ka dodâl che a nih, Aw nang mi chapo, LALPA, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih; i ni, ka hung hremna ding che ni chu a hung tlung mêk sih a."
32,"And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.","Chun, mi chapo chu insui a ta, tlûng a tih, tukhawma ama chu keitho naw ni hai; a khawpuiahai chun mei sêm ka ta, ama vêla umhai po po chu kâng hmang vawng a tih."
33,Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.,"“Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Israel thlahai le Juda thla- hai chu nêksâwrin an um rêl a; anni sala mantuhai taphawt hlak chun an chel det tlat a, an infetir nuom nawh a."
34,"Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.","Anni sanhimtu chu a hrât a, a hming khawm, sipaihai LALPA a nih, ama chun an chungthu chu ṭan tlat a ta; hnuoi chunga chun châwlna a pêk thei a, Babulon hluotuhai ruok chu a sukto ṭawkṭawk nawna dingin."
35,"A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.","Kâwlhnâm chu Kaldaihai chunga dâm, Babulon hluotuhai chunga dâm, a rorêltuhai le a mivar- hai chunga chun a um a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
36,"A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.","Chapohai chunga chun kâwl- hnâm chu a um a, invêtpui an ta, kâwlhnâm chu a mi thilthawtheihai chungah a um a, beidawng an tih."
37,"A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.","Kâwlhnâm chu an sakawrhai chunga dâm, an sakawr tawlailîrhai chunga dâm, ama sûnga mi chilakhai po po chunga dâm chun a um a, chuongchun, anni chu nuhmei ang el nîng an ta, kâwlhnâm chu a ro inhai chunga chun a um a, inrûkin um a tih."
38,"A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols.","A tuihai chunga chun kangna a um a, kangchat an tih; milim ker- fâwm ram a na, milimah an invêt ri ngawt el a ni sih a."
39,"Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.","“Chuleiin, thlalêr ramsa hrâng- hai chu sihalhai leh chutaka chun chêng an ta; vangalsânghai khawm chêng an ta; kumkhuoin hluo hrim hrim ni ta naw ni; suona inthawka suon dang chena khawm hluo ni naw ni."
40,"As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.","Pathien chun Gomorra le Sodom le a vêl khuohai chu a pei thlâk lai ang khan, LALPA chun a tih: chutaka chun mi chêng naw ni hai a, mihriem nau tukhawm chutaka chun inzin khawm vân zin naw ni hai."
41,"Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.","Ngai ta u, hmâr tienga in- thawkin hnam pakhat an hung a, hnam ropuitak el, lal tamtakhai le chun leihnuoi kilkhâwrtaka inthawk chen chun chawktho nîng an ta."
42,"They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.","Anni chun thalngul le fei an chawi a; an rilo hle a, lunginsietna an nei nawh; an râwlhai chu tuisuoriet angin ân rûm a, sakawr chungahai chun an chuong a; Aw Babulon nau- nu, nangma chunga chun, indonaa mi angin, mi tin chu an intlar a nih."
43,"The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.","Babulona lal chun an ri chu a lo hriet a, a kuthai chu a hung chau a, ama chu lunginzîngna chun a man tah a, nuhmei nauhase nat tuor angin a na tah a."
44,"Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that can stand before me?","“Ngai ta u, umhmun det chu doin, Jordan chaponaa inthawk chun sakeibaknei angin hung suok a ta; amiruokchu, amaa inthawk chun intlânsiettir vak ka tih; chun mi ama chunga thunei ding chun ruot ka ta; kei ang hi tu am an um hrim a? Tuin am hun mi ruotpêk a ta? Berâm vêngtu ka hmaa ngîr ding chu tu am a na?"
45,"Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.","Chuleiin, Babulon chungthua LALPAIN thurâwn a nei chu lo ngai ta u, Kaldaihai ram chunga thiltum a nei tâk le chun. Matheiloin anni chu ran ruol têhai hnûkhmangin um ngei ngei an ta, an chêngna chu anni irâusanin siempêk a tih."
46,"At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.","Babulon lâkna ria chun hnuoi chu ân thin a, hnamhai laia chun a khêk ri chu hrietin a um a,” tiin."
