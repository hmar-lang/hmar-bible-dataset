1,"The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","Benjamin rama Anathotha um thiempuhai laia mi, Hilkia naupa Jeremia thuhai chu."
2,"to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.","Ama kuoma chun Juda lal Amon naupa Josia hun lai, a rorêl a kum sâwm le pathum kum chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a,"
3,"It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.","Juda lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim hun lai, Juda lal Josia naupa Zedekia kum sâwm pakhat kum tâwp chen; Jerusalem sala ṭhuoihmanga a um a thla ngana chen chun a hung tlung zing a."
4,"Now the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:"
5,"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.","“Phîng sûnga ka siem hma che khawma ka hriet cheh a, Sula inthawka i hung suok hma khawma ka sukthieng ta cheh a: Hnamhai kuoma zâwlnei dingin ka lo thlang ta che a nih,” tiin."
6,"Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am a child.","Chun, kei chun, “E, Lalpa PATHIEN, ngai ta, thu ka hril thei le; naupang el ka ni sih a,” ka tih a."
7,"But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go, and whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun ka kuomah hieng hin a hril a: “Naupang el ka nih, ti naw rawh, Tu kuoma khawm ka tirna phawt che kuoma chun i fe ding a ni sih a; Thu ka pêk ang pei che chun thu hril bawk i tih."
8,"Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.","Anni lei chun ṭi naw la, Nang chu sanhim ding chein i kuomah ka um sih a; LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
9,"Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth:","Chun, LALPA chun a kutin a hung ban a, ka bau chu a tâwk tah a; chun, LALPA chun ka kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, i baua chun ka thuhai chu ka sie tah,"
10,"see, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.","En ta, vawisûn hin, hnamhai chunga le ramhai chunga chun, Hrukbit ding le, sukchim ding le, Sukse ding le, Pei thla ding le, bâwl ding le Phun dingin ka sie ta che a nih,” a ta."
11,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.","Chu naw khawm chu LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a, “Jeremia, ieng am i hmuh a?” a mi tih a. Kei chun, “Almon thing hmawl ka hmu,” ka tih a."
12,"Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.","LALPA chun ka kuomah, “I hmu ṭha ngawt el; ka thu chu sukpuitlinga um dingin ka tûng tlat a nih,” a ta."
13,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face thereof is from the north.","Chun, a vawi hninaa chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a, “Ieng am i hmuh a?” tiin. Kei chun, “Sumbepui so lai ka hmuh a, chu hmai chu hmâr tienga inthawka hung ngha a nih,” ka tih a."
14,"Then Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Hmâr tienga inthawkin ram hluotu- hai po po chungah thil ṭha naw hung so suok a ta."
15,"For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.","Ngai ta, hmâr tienga lalram sûngkuohai po po chu ka ko ding a ni si a, LALPA chun a tih; chun, hung an ta, mi tin chun Jerusalem dai kawt- khâr lûtnaa le a vêlsuokin kul bang- hai bula le, Juda khawpuihai po poa chun an lalṭhungpha chu hung innghat an tih."
16,"And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.","Chun, an khawhlonahai thuah anni kalin ka rorêlnahai chu hrilsuok ka tih, kei mi mâksana, pathien danghai kuoma riminhnik rawh a, an kut sinthawhai ngei chu chibai an lo bûk ta leiin."
17,"Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them.","Chuleiin, nang chun i dier kei la, tho la, thu ka pêkhai po po che kha an kuomah hril rawh; annia chun beidawng naw la, chuong naw chun, an hmaa chun sukbeidawng rawi ka ti che."
18,"For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.","Ngai ta, vawisûn hin ram po po hmaah, Juda lalhai chunga le, chu- taka rorêltuhai chunga le, thiempu- hai chunga le, chu rama mipuihai po po chunga chun dârsen banghai, thîr sûtpuihai le khawpui kul neiah ka siem che hi."
19,"And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee.","Chuongchun, do an ti cheh a; amiruokchu, hne naw ni hai che; nangma sanhim ding chein i kuom- ah ka um sih a, LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
