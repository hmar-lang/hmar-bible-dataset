2,"thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hnamhai lampuihai chu inchûk naw la, chungtienga inchiknahaia chun lunginzîng el bawk naw rawh, hnam- hai chu chuonghaia chun an lungin- zîng hlak sih a."
3,"For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.","Hnamhai dânhai chu teplo mei mei an na; rama inthawkin thing an hang phûr thlûk a, themthiem mi chun a hreipuiin a chei a."

5,"They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.","Leipuia vate ṭi milim ang an na, nisienlakhawm, an ṭawng nawh a; an fe thei naw leiin zâwn an ngai a. Anni chu ṭi naw la, thil suol khawm an thaw thei nawh a, annia chun thil ṭha thawna ding khawm a um bawk nawh."

7,"Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.","Aw hnamhai Laltak, tuin am ṭi nâwng an ti cheh a? Nang chun i phu hrim sih a, hnamhai laia mi var po po lai le, an lalram sûngahai chun, nang- a ang hrim tukhawm an um nawh."
8,But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.,"Anni chu ngawngtak le invêt an na, milim inchûktirna chu thing bul el chu a nih."
9,"There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.","Tangkaruo thlênghaia sut, Tar- sisa inthawka hung lâkhai le, Uphaza inthawka rângkachak, themthiem le rângkachak thîrsu kuthai sinthaw chu: a dum pâwl le a dum êm chu an thuom dingin, mi themthiemhai kutsuok vawng an nih."
10,"But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.","Amiruokchu, LALPA chau Pathien diktak chu a na, Pathien hring chu a na, chatuon lal a nih; a lunginsenna chun hnuoi chu ân thin a, a lungawi nawna chu hnamhai chun an tuor thei nawh."
11,"Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.","Hieng hin an kuoma chun hril i tih: hnuoi le vânhai siemtu ni lo pathienhai chu, chuonghai chu vân- khuphnuoia inthawk le leihnuoia inthawk chun bohmang an tih."
12,"He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens.","A thilthawtheina chun hnuoi chu a siem a, a varna chun khawvêl chu a lo tungding tah a, a hrietthiem- nahai chun vânhai khawm chu a lo keiphar tah a;"
13,"When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.","a râwl a hung insuo pha chun vânhaia tuihai chu a hung phul a, leihnuoi tâwpnaa inthawk dâm chun tuihu chu ân kaitir a, ruo ta ding chun kâwlinlephai a siem a, a robâwmhaia inthawk chun thli chu a hung lâk suok a."
14,"Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.","Mi tin el chu ngawngtak, hriet- na nei lo an na; rângkachak suttu tinhai khawm chu a milim kera siem lei chun sukzakin a um a; a milim sunghai chu khêlthu ngawt a na, an- nia chun inthuokna a um si nawh a."

17,"Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.","Aw nang inhuola um, rama inthawk chun i thuomhnawhai chu la khâwm rawh."
18,"For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Hieng ang huna hin ram hluotuhai chu the suok ka ta, an tuorna dingin anni chu sukrinum ka tih."
19,"Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.","Ka natna lei chun ka chung a va rik de! ka hliemna chu a nasa hle a; nisienlakhawm, “Indiktakin hi hi ka natna chu a na, ka tuor ding hrim a nih,” ka tih a."
20,"My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.","Ka puon in chu suksiet a ni tah a; ka hruihai po po khawm suktan an ni tah a; ka nauhai khawm chu keimaa inthawkin an fe hmang a, an um ta nawh a; ka puon in keiphar nâwk ding tukhawm an um ta nawh a, ka puonzârhai zâr ding leh."
21,"For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.","Berâmpuhai hlak chu an ngawng êm a, LALPA chu an râwn si nawh a; chuleiin, an hlawtling nawh a, an berâm ruolhai po po chu an indar zo a."
22,"The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.","Thuthang râwl chu, ngai ta, a hung mêk a nih, Juda ram chu râusan le sihalhai chêngna hmuna siem dingin hmâr ram tienga inthawk buoina nasatak a hung mêk a nih."
23,"O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.","Aw LALPA, mihriem lampui chu amaa chun a um nawh ti ka hriet a; a kepênhai sukdik dingin mihriem- a chun infetirtu chu a um nawh."
24,"O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.","Aw LALPA, mi sukdik la, ami- ruokchu, rorêlnain, i lunginsennain ni loin, chuong naw chun iengkhawm ni loin mi siem rawi i tih."
25,"Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name; for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.","Khawhri be mi, nang hre lohai chunga le, hnam nangma hming lam ngailohai chunga chun i ṭiumna chu bunthla la, Jakob chu an fâk zo sih a; anih, ama chu an fâk zo a, an kâng- hmang dêr a, a umna khawm chu an suksiet a."
