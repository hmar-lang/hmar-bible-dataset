1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,",Juda ram lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim inlal kum linaa chun hi thu hi LALPA kuoma in- thawk chun Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung tah a:
2,"Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.","“Lekhabu zuol la la, chutaka chun Israel ram chungthu le, Juda ram chungthu le, hnam po pohai chungthu, Josia hun laia inthawka i kuoma thu ka hril nia inthawka vawisûn ni chena mi hi, thu ka hrilhai po po chu ziek rawh."
3,It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.,"An chunga thil ṭha naw thaw ka tum chu Juda sûngkuohai chun an hrietin, an suolna chu ka ngaidam theina dingin mi tin chu mâni um dân suola inthawk chun an hung kîr rawi mawh,” tiin."
4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.","Chun, Jeremia chun Neria naupa Baruk chu a ko a; Baruk chun LALPAIN a kuoma thu a hrilhai po po chu lekhabu zuola chun Jeremia baua inthawk chun a ziek tah a."
5,"And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah:","Jeremia chun Baruk chu thu a pêk a, “Kei chu khum ka na, LALPA ina chun ka fe thei nawh a;"
6,"therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovah’s house upon the fast-day; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.","chuleiin, nang va fe la, lekhabu zuola ka baua inthawka LALPA thuhai i ziekhai kha bunghei niin LALPA inah mipui na hrieta chun va tiem rawh; chun, Juda mi an khawpuihaia inthawka hung suokhai po po na hrieta chun tiem bawk rawh."
7,"It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Jehovah hath pronounced against this people.","An hnina chu LALPA hmaa pein, mi tin chu mâni um dân suola inthawk chun an hung kîr rawi mawh: hi mihai chunga lunginsenna le ṭitumna LALPAIN a hril chu a nasa hle sih a,” tiin."
8,"And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovah’s house.","Chun, Neria naupa Baruk chun, LALPA ina chun LALPA thuhai chu lekhabua chun tiemin zâwlnei Jeremia thupêk po po angtak chun a thaw tah a."
9,"Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Jehovah.","Chun, Juda ram lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim inlal kum ngana, thla kuonaa chun Jerusalema mi po pohai, Juda ram khawpuihaia inthawka Jerusalema mipui hung po pohai chun LALPA hmaa bunghei chu an phuong tah a."
10,"Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Jehovah’s house, in the ears of all the people.","Chun, mipui po po na hrieta chun, LALPA in dai kawtkhâr thar lûtnaa, huong sûng tuollai chung- hnung lema um, lekhaziektu Saphan naupa Gemaria pindanah, LALPA ina chun Baruk chun Jeremia thuhai chu a tiem tah a."
11,"And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah,","Chun, Saphan naupa, Gemaria naupa Mikaia chun lekhabua LALPA thu po pohai chu a hriet chun,"
12,"he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes were sitting there, to wit, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.","lekhaziektuhai pindanah lal ina chun a zu fe thla tah a; chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun lalhai po po, lekhaziek- tu Elisama, Semaia naupa Delaia, Akbor naupa Elnathan, Saphan naupa Gemaria, Hanania naupa Zedekia le lalhai po po chu an ṭhung a."
13,"Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.","Chun, Mikaia chun mipui na hrieta Barukin lekhabu chu a tiem laia a lo hriet thuhai po po chu anni kuoma chun a hrilfie tah a."
14,"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.","Chuleiin, lalhai po po chun Kusi naupa Selemia, chu naupa Nethania naupa Jehudi chu Baruk kâwlah an tir a, “Mipuihai na hrieta lekha zuol i tiemna kha la la, hung chawi la, hung rawh,” tiin. Chuongchun, Neria naupa Baruk chun Lekhabu zuol chu a kutin a lâk a, an kuoma chun a hung tah a."
15,"And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Tuhin ṭhung la, kan na hrieta hin tiem ta,” an tih a. Chuongchun, Baruk chun an na hrieta chun a tiem tah a."
16,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.","Chun, chuong thuhai po po chu an hriet chun, anni le anni chu an inṭi tuo seng tah a, chuongchun, Baruk kuoma chun, “Hieng thuhai po po hi lal chu hril ngei ngei kan tih,” an tih a."
17,"And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?","Chun, Baruk kuoma chun, “A baua inthawk chun hieng thuhai po po hi ieng tiziea ziek am i na, mi hril rawh,” tiin an indawn a."
18,"Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.","Baruk chun anni chu a dawn a, “A bauin hieng thuhai po po hi ka kuomah a hung hril a, kei chun lekha- bua chun lekhatuiin ka lo ziek el a nih,” tiin."
19,"Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.","Chuongchun, lalhai chun Baruk kuoma chun, “Fe la, Jeremia le nang chu inbihmang ro, khaw lai am in um ti tukhawm inhriettir naw ro,” an tih a."
20,And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.,"Chun, anni chu huong sûng tuollaia chun lal kuomah an va feh a; amiruokchu, lekhabu zuol chu lekha- ziektu Elisama pindana khan an mâksan a; chuongchun, lal na hrieta chun thuhai po po chu an hril tah a."
21,"So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.","Chuongchun, lal chun Jehudi chu lekhabu zuol chu hung la dingin a tir a; ama chun lekhaziektu Elisama pindana inthawk chun a lâk suok a. Jehudi chun lal na hrieta le, a sîra ngîrhai lalhai po po na hrieta chun a tiem tah a."
22,Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.,"Thla kuona a na, lal chu thlasik ina chun a ṭhung a, a hmaa chun meithuk a um a. Chun, mei inti hi a um a."
23,"And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.","Chun, Jehudi chun phêk thum amanih, phêk li amanih a tiem phing chun lal chun chemtê hin a ât thlâk a, meithuka meiin lekhabu zuol chu a kâng zo vawng chenin, meithuka meia chun a pei lût pei tah a."
24,"And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.","Anni chu an ṭi nawh a, an silfênhai khawm an keithlêr bawk nawh a, hieng thuhai hretu lal le a siehlawhai hrim hrim khawm chun."
25,Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.,"Chu naw khawm Elnathan le Delaia le Gemaria chun lal kuoma chun lekhabu zuol chu raw lo dingin hnina an siem a, nisienlakhawm, anni chu a ngai nawh a."
26,"And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them.","Chun, lal chun lal naupa Jerahmeel le, Azriel naupa Seraia le, Abdeel naupa Selemia chu lekhaziek- tu Baruk le zâwlnei Jeremia chu man dingin thu a pêk a; nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun anni chu a thup a."
27,"Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, Jeremia baua inthawka Barukin thu a ziekhai le, lekhabu zuol chu lal chun a raw zo vawng chun Jeremia kuomah LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:"
28,"Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.","“Lekhabu zuol dang la nâwk la, Juda ram lal Jehoiakimin a raw tah, lekhabu zuol hmasaa um thu hma- sahai po po kha ziek rawh."
29,"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?","Chun, Juda ram lal Jehoiakim chungthua chun hieng ang hin hril i tih; ‘LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Babulon lal chu hung a ta, hi ram hi hung sukse ngei a ta, chutaka in- thawk chun ramsa le mihriem khawm sukchavai a tih, tia, ieng- dinga hitaka hi ziek am in nih a?’ tiin, hi lekhabu zuol hi i raw ta chu a na."
30,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.","Chuleiin, Juda ram lal Jehoia- kim chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: David lalṭhungpha chunga ṭhung ding tukhawm nei naw nih a; chun, a taksa thi chu sûnah lumah, zânah zildeiah peihâwn nîng a tih."
31,"And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.","Chun, ama le a thla le sie- hlawhai chu an suolna leiin hrem ka ta, chun, an chunga le, Jerusalem hluotuhai chunga le, Juda rama mihai chunga chun, an chunga tlung dinga ka hril, thil ṭha nawhai po po kha intlungtir ka tih; nisienla- khawm, an la ngai naw rawp a,” tiin."
32,"Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words.","Chun, Jeremia chun lekhabu zuol dang chu a lâk a, Neria naupa Baruk, lekhaziektu kuoma chun a pêk tah a; ama chun Juda ram lal Jehoiakimin a lo raw tah lekhabua thuhai po po chu Jeremia baua inthawk chun a ziek tah a; chu naw khawm chu thu angkhat tamtakhai chu an kuoma belsain a um a."
