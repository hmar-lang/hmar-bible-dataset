1,"Thus said Jehovah, Go, and buy a potter’s earthen bottle, and take of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Fe la, bêl hemtu pil bêl inchaw la, chun, mipuihai laia upahai le, thiempuhai laia upahai ṭhuoi la."
2,"and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee;","Hinnom naupa phairuom, Harsith dâi kawtkhâr lûtna bula uma chun fe unla, chutaka chun thu ka hril che chu hril suok rawh."
3,"and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.","Hieng hin ti la. Nangni Juda ram lalhai le, Jerusalem hluotuhai, LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u; sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, hi hmuna hin thil ṭha naw kân tlungtir ding a nih; a hre taphawt chu an nahai chu khel a tih."
4,"Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, that they knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,","Kei an mi lo nghatsan tah a, hi hmun khawm hi an lo sukhran tah a, an hriet lo pathienhai kuoma chun a sûnga hin riminhnik chu, anni le an thlatuhai le Juda ram lalhai ngei khawma an lo raw tâk leiin; hi hi hmun hi mi thiem thisen chun an lo suksip tah a;"
5,"and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:","Baal bâwlhmunhai chu an bâwl a, Baal kuoma pumrawhmang thilin- hlân dinga an naupasalhai râwna dingin; chu chu thu ka pêk hlek nawh a, hril khawm ka hril nawh a, ka lungrila khawm a hung lût ngai nawh;"
6,"therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.","chuleiin, ngai ta u, a nihai chu a hung tlung, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hi hi phairuom hi Topheth ama- nih, Hinnom naupa Phairuom ama- nih ti ni ta naw nih a. Inthatna Ruom ti ni lem tâng a tih."
7,"And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.","Chun, hi hmuna hin Juda ram le Jerusalem thurawt chu inthlâwntir ka ta; an hringna zawngtuhai le, an hmêlmahai hmaa chun kâwlhnâmah intlûktir ka tih; chun, an ruonghai chu chunglêng vatehai le, hnuoia ramsahai ta dingin bu dingin pêng ka tih."
8,"And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.","Hi khawpui hi maktia le thuok- dawngumah siem ka ta; mi tin a fe khêltuhai taphawt chun mak tîng an ta, an thuok dawng a tih, chu chu hmun po po a se ta lei chun."
9,"And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall distress them.","Chun, an naupasalhai le an nau- nuhmeihai sahai chu infâktir ka ta; mi tin chun, inhuolnaa le chârchil- naah, an hmêlmahai le an hringna zawngtuhaiin an chârchilnaa chun, mâni ruolhai sa chu fa tâwl an tih."
10,"Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,","Chun, nangma hung zuitu mi- hai mithmua chun bêl chu sukkhawi i ta,"
11,"and shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.","an kuoma chun, Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a ti a nih: Hieng ang bawk hin, bêl hemtu bûr chu miin siem ṭhat nâwk thei ni ta loa a suksiet ang hin hi khawpui le hi hnam hi ka suksiet ding a nih; chuongchun, inphûmna ding um naw khawp rauin Tophetha chun inphûm an tih."
12,"Thus will I do unto this place, saith Jehovah, and to the inhabitants thereof, even making this city as Topheth:","Hi hmun hi Topheth ang ela siemin, hi hmun hluotuhai chunga le hi hmun chunga hin ka thaw ding a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
13,"and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods.","Jerusalem inhai le Juda lalhai inhai sukpawrchea lo um tahai chu Topheth hmun ang lo ni tâng a ta, in a chunga vâna umhai po po kuoma riminhnik an lo râwna, pathienhai kuoma dâwnmi thilinhlânhai an lo bunthlâkna po pohai chu,” tiin."
14,"Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Jehovah’s house, and said to all the people:","Chun, LALPAIN thuhril dinga a tirna Tophetha inthawk chun Jere- mia chu a hung a; LALPA in inhuon- na tuollaia chun a ngîr a, mipuihai po po kuoma chun,"
15,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.","“Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih. Ngai ta u, a chunga tlung dinga ka lo hril ta po po, thil ṭha naw po po chu hi khawpui le a khawperhai po po chunga chun ka hung intlungtir ding a nih, anni chun an lungril an sukngar a; ka thuhai chu an ngai nawna dingin,” a ta."
