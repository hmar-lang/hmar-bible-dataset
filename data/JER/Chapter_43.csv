1,"And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, wherewith Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,","Chun, hieng thuhai po po, LALPA an Pathienin an kuom- a ama a tirna, LALPA an Pathien thuhai po po chu mipuihai po po kuoma Jeremia chun a hril zo chun,"
2,"then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say, Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;","Hossia naupa Azaria hai, Karea naupa Johanan hai, mi chapo po pohai chun Jeremia kuomah thu an hril a “Thukhêl i hril dêr a nih: ‘Chutaka va mikhuol dingin, Aigupta rama chun in fe ding a ni nawh,’ ti dingin LALPA kan Pathien chun a hung tir naw cheh a;"
3,"but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.","Neria naupa Baruk chun an mi that theina ding le, Babulona sala an mi ṭhuoi theina dingin Kaldaihai kuta mîn hlân dingin, nang hi kan chunga chun a hung tir che a ni hi,” tiin."
4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, to dwell in the land of Judah.","Chuongchun, Karea naupa Johanan hai, sipai hotuhai po po le mipuihai po po chun Juda rama chêng zing ding thu LALPA râwl chu an awi nawh a."
5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven, to sojourn in the land of Judah;","Chuongchun, Karea naupa Joha- nan le, sipai hotuhai po po chun Juda rama la um sunhai, Juda rama hnawt hmang an nina hnamhaia inthawka hung kîr nâwkhai,"
6,"the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.","pasalhai, nuhmeihai, naupang- hai, lal naunuhmeihai le, mi tin Nebuzaradanin Saphan naupa Ahikam, chu naupa Gedalia le zâwl- nei Jeremia le, Neria naupa Baruk kuoma a mâksanhai chu an ṭhuoi a;"
7,And they came into the land of Egypt; for they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah: and they came unto Tahpanhes.,"Aigupta rama chun an fe tah a; LALPA râwl chu an awi si nawh a; chuongchun, Tahpanhes chenin an fe tah a."
8,"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,","Chun, Tahpanhesa chun Jeremia kuomah LALPA kuoma inthawka thu chu a hung tlung a;"
9,"Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in mortar in the brickwork, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;","“Lung lientak takhai i kutin la la, Juda mihai mithmua chun, Tahpan- hesa Pharao in lûtna bula um, ṭêklei siemna hmuna a chârna chira chun phûm rawh;"
10,"and say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.","chun, an kuoma chun, ‘Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, mi tir ka ta, ka siehlaw Nebukadnezzar Babulon lal chu hung ṭhuoi ka ta, kha lung ka phûmhai chunga khan a lalṭhungpha chu innghat a tih; chuong chunga chun a lal puon in chu zar a tih."
11,"And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death shall be given to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.","Ama chu hung a ta, Aigupta rama chu hung hrem a ta, thinaa pêk dinghai chu thinaah, sala intâng dinghai chu salah, kâwlhnâma ding- hai chu kâwlhnâm kuoma pêk nîng an tih."
12,"And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.","Chun, Aigupta pathienhai ina chun mei sêm a ta; ama chun râwng a ta, salah ṭhuoi hmang a tih; berâmpu chu ama silfêna ân chei angin, ama chu Aigupta ram chun inchei a tih; chutaka inthawk chun thlamuong- takin fe suok tâng a tih."
13,"He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.","Chun, Beth-semes sûtpuihai Aigupta rama um khawm chu suk- thliek bawk a ta, Aigupta ram pa- thienhai inhai khawm chu meia raw ni bawk an tih,’ a tih, ti rawh,” tiin."
