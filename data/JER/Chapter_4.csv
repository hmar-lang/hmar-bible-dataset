1,"If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, if thou wilt return unto me, and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight; then shalt thou not be removed;","“Aw Israel, i hung kîr chun, LALPA Pathien chun a tih: ka kuomah i hung kîr ding a nih; i tirdakumnahai chu ka mithmua inthawka i sie hmang chun nang chu sukchângin um naw ti nih;"
2,"and thou shalt swear, As Jehovah liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.","chuongchun, nang chun, ‘LALPA chu a hring zing angin, thudikah, rorêlnaah, felnaah, hnamhai chu amaa chun engthâwl an ta, amaa chun chawimawiin um an tih,’ tiin ṭawng inkhâm i ta.”"
3,"For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.","Jerusalema le Juda rama mihai kuoma chun, LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: In hnuoi inlet lo chu suknawi unla, hling lai chun chi thlâk naw ro."
4,"Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.","LALPA kuoma chun ser intan unla, in lungril ser chu tan ro, nangni Jerusalema mihai le, Juda rama mi- hai; chuong naw chun ka lunginsenna chu mei angin fe suok a ta, i thilthaw- hai rîtlona lei chun; tukhawm iṭhel ruol loin kâng a tih."
5,"Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.","Juda rama chun hrilfie unla, Jerusalema chun phuong ro, “Rama chun tawtawrâwt chu mût unla, khêk inring unla, hieng hin ti ro: Hung inkhâwm tâwl unla, khawpui kul- neiahai chun fêng ei tiu,” tiin."
6,"Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.","Zion tienga chun puonzâr chu khai unla, himna dingin tlânhmang unla, muong naw ro; hmar tienga inthawkin thil ṭha naw sietna nasa- tak chu ka hung intlungtir ding a ni sih a."
7,"A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.","Sakeibaknei chu a chîmbuka in- thawk chun a hung suok tah a, hnam- hai sukbohmangtu ding chu; a lam- puia chun a thang mêk a, a hmuna inthawk chun a suok tah a, i ram chu râusana siem ding le, i khawpuihai khawm hluotuhai um loa sukse dingin."
8,"For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.","Hi hi lei hin saiip puon dierkei unla, sûn unla, ṭap inrûm ro; LALPA lunginsenna ṭium chu einia inthawk- in a hnungkîr si nawh a."
9,"And it shall come to pass at that day, saith Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.","Chuong nia chun LALPA chun a tih: Lal lungril chu bohmang a ta, rorêltuhai le thiempuhai lungril chun maktîng a tih; zâwlneihai khawma maktîng an tih."
10,"Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the life.","Chun, kei chun, “E, Lalpa PATHIEN! Hi hnam le Jerusalem hi i lo hlêm let dêr a ni hi, ‘Muongna nei in tih,’ tiin i lo hril a, kâwlhnâm hlak chun hringna ngei a sun ta lem si hi,” ka tih a."
11,"At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;","Chu huna chun chu hnam le Jerusalem kuoma chun, “Thlalêra bâwlhmunhaia inthawkin ka mihai naunuhai tienga chun thli lum tak, mûtdeina ding ni si lo, sukfai ding khawm ni lo;"
12,a full wind from these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgments against them.,"thli hrâttak hienga inthawk hin ka kuomah hung a tih; tuta an chungthu rêla hriltu khawm hi kei ka nih,” ti nîng a tih."
13,"Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are ruined.","Ngai ta, ama chu sûmhai angin a tungin hung a ta, a sakawr tawlai- lîrhai chu thlivir ang nîng an tih, a sakawrhai khawm chu mupuihai nêkin an hrât lem a nih. Ei chung a va rik de! suksietin ei um sih a."
14,"O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee?","Aw Jerusalem, sandama i um theina dingin i khawhlonaa inthawk chun i lungril chu sâwpfai rawh. I ngaituona rilohai hi ieng chen am i lungrila chun a châm ding a na?"
15,"For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth evil from the hills of Ephraim.","Dana inthawk chun râwl chun a hung hrilfieh a, Ephraim muolhaia inthawk chun thil suol a hung phuongdar a;"
16,"Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.","hnamhai kuoma chun hrilna nei rawh; ngai ta, Jerusalem chunga chun phuong la, vêngtuhai chu ram hlataka inthawkin an hung a, Juda khawpuihai chu demin an râwlhai an insuo a nih."
17,"As keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah.","Lo vêngtuhai ang elin, a vêlin an umnghah a; keia chungah a lo hel ta leiin, LALPA chun a tih."
18,"Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reacheth unto thy heart.",I thilthawhai le i lampui chun hieng thilhai hi ân neitir che a ni hi; hi hi i khawhlona chu a nih: khâk khawm a kha sih a; i lung chen a tlung ta sih a.
19,"My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.","Ka phîng, ka phîng! ka lungah a na; ka lung chu a to ṭawk ṭawk naw tawp a; ka to ṭawk ṭawk thei nawh; indona inṭhi lâwkna tawtawrâwt ri chu, aw ka thla, i lo hriet ta leiin."
20,"Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, and my curtains in a moment.","Bohmangna chungah bohmang- na a tlung a; ram pumpui chu suksiet a ni ta sih a, chawmkhat kârin ka puon inhai chu suksiet an na, mit- khap kâr loin ka puonzârhai khawm chu."
21,"How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?","Ieng chen am puonzâr chu ka hmuin, tawtawrâwt ri chu ka hriet zing ding a na?"
22,"For my people are foolish, they know me not; they are sottish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.","“Ka mihai an invêt a, an mi hriet si nawh a; naupang invêttak ang, hrietthiemna hrim khawm an nei naw, thil ṭha naw thaw dingin an var a, thil ṭha thaw ding ruok chun hrietna an nei nawh.”"
23,"I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.","Leihnuoi chu ka en leh, ngai ta, a ruok le a sie a na; vânhai khawm chun varna an nei nawh a."
24,"I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.","Tlânghai chu ka en leh, ngai ta, an inthin a, muolhai po po khawm chu hnungtieng hmatieng an in- sâwi a."
25,"I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.","Ka hei en a, chun, ngai ta, mihriem hrim hrim an um nawh a, chunglêng vatehai khawm chu an tlân hmang tah a."
26,"I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, and before his fierce anger.","Ka hei en a, ngai ta, ram rahlâwktakhai khawm chu thlalêr a lo ni tah a, chutaka khawpuihai po po chu LALPA hmaihmaa le, a lungin- senna ṭiumtak hmaa chun a lo chim tâwl tah a."
27,"For thus saith Jehovah, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a, “Ram pumpui chu râusan nîng a ta, a tâwp ruok chu intlungtir naw ning."
28,"For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.","Hi hi lei hin leihnuoi chun sûn a ta, chun, chunga vânhai inthim a tih; ka hril ta leiin, ka tum tlat tah a; kân sîr bawk nawh a; chutaka inthawk lamlêt bawk naw ning.”"
29,"Every city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein.","Khawpui sûng po po chu sakawr chung chuong mihai le, thal kâp mihai ria chun an tlânseh a; chîm- bukahai chun an feh a, râwlkhoahai chun an lâwn a; khawpui tinhai chu mâksanin a um a, mi hrim an chêng ta nawh a."
30,"And thou, when thou art made desolate, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlargest thine eyes with paint, in vain dost thou make thyself fair; thy lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.","Chun, nang suksieta um, ieng am thâwng i ta? Sen inlârin inthuom la khawm, rângkachak thuomhnaw- haiin inchei la khawm, i mithai khawm chu rawnga nâlin suklien la khawm; nang le nang în sukhmêlṭha thlâwn el nîng a tih; i hmangaihai chun an hnâwl cheh a, i hringna lâk an tum a nih."
31,"For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul fainteth before the murderers.","Nuhmei pakhat nauhase nat tuor, a nau lutîr hung suok dinga a na tuor râwl ang chu ka hriet sih a, Zion naunu, thuok insama, a kuthai phara, “Tuhin ka chung a rik de! tuolthattuhai hmaa chun ka thla chu a thidang sih a,” titu râwl chu a nih."
