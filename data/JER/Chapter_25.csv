1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon),",Juda ram lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim inlal kum linaa Juda mipui po po chungthua Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chu: chu kum ma chu Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar inlal kum khatna a na;
2,"which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:","chu chu zâwlnei Jeremia chun Juda mipui po po le Jerusalem hluo- tuhai po po kuoma chun a hril a,"
3,"From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of Jehovah hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.","“Juda ram lal Amon naupa Josia inlal kum sâwmpathum kuma in- thawka vawisûn ni chen hin, hi kum sâwmhni pathum sûng hin LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung hlak a; chun, in kuoma chun ṭhahnem- ngaitakin ka lo hril hlak cheu a; amiruokchu, in awi ngai nawh a."
4,"And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear),","Chun, LALPA chun inhmataka thoa anni chu hung tirin a siehlaw zâwlneihai po po chu in kuomah a hung tir a, amiruokchu, in lo ngai nawh a, in nahai khawm in sit bawk nawh."
5,"saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore;","‘Mi tin el chu tuhin in thilthaw indik nawhaia inthawk le, mâni lam- pui suola inthawk chun kîr seng unla; nangni le in thlatuhai kuoma inhma le kumkhuoa dinga, LALPAIN ram a pêk cheua chun chêng ro;"
6,"and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.","chun, pathien danghai chu an rawng bâwl ding le anni chibai bûk dingin zui naw unla, in kut sinthaw- hai chun mi suklungsen bawk naw ro; chuongchun, nangni khawm sukna naw ning cheu,’ an tih a."
7,"Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.","Ana chu, ka thu chu in ngai nawh a, LALPA chun a tih; in insuknatna dinga in kut sinthawhai chun in mi suklungsen a."
8,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words,","Chuleiin, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ka thuhai chu in ngai naw leiin,"
9,"behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith Jehovah, and I will send unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.","ngai ta u, mi tir ka ta, hmâr rama inthawk chun sûngkuohai po po chu ko ka tih, LALPA chun a tih; chun, ka siehlaw Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar kuoma chun mi tir ka ta; anni chu hi ram le, a hluotuhai le, a vêla hnamhai po po chunga do dingin hung ṭhuoi ka ta; chuongchun, anni chu sukse letdêr ka ta, makti ding le, inchekna ding le, kumkhaw rausanah ka siem ding a nih."
10,"Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.","Chu nawa khawm, anni laia inthawk chun, hlimna râwl dâm, lâwmna râwl dâm, mo neitu râwl dâm, mo râwl dâm, bu râwtna ri dâm, sathâu khâwnvar varna dâm chu sukbo vawng ka tih."
11,"And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.","Chuongchun, hi ram pumpui hi rausan le maktiah um a ta; chun, hnamhai chun kum sâwmsari sûng Babulon lal rawng chu bâwl an tih."
12,"And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate for ever.","Chun, kum sâwmsari chu ân vawi pha chun, an suolna leiin, Babulon lal le, chu hnam le, Kaldai- hai ram chu hrem ka ta; kumkhuoa rausanah siem ka tih, LALPA chun a tih."
13,"And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.","Chu ram chunga ka thuhai tlung dinga ka hril tah, hi lekhabua ziek ta ngeihai, Jeremia chun hnam- hai chu dodala a lo hril tahai ngei chu hung intlungtir ka ta."
14,"For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.","Hnam tam takhai le lal ropuihai chun anni chu anni ngei chu, suokah siem an ta; chuongchun, anni chu an kuthai sinthaw ang pei le, an thil- thawhai ang peiin ka thung ding a nih,” tiin."
15,"For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.","Israel Pathien, LALPA chun ka kuomah hieng hin a ti sih a: “Hi lung- insenna no ka kuta hi la la, hnam an kuoma ka tirnahai po po che chu indâwntir tâwl rawh."
16,"And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.","Chun, dâwn an ta, hnungtieng hmatieng insâwn an ta, invêt an tih; anni laia kâwlhnâm ka tir ding lei chun,” tiin."
17,"Then took I the cup at Jehovah’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah had sent me:","Chun, LALPA kuta no chu ka lâk a, LALPAIN a mi tirna hnamhai po po kân dâwntir a;"
18,"to wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;","Chuong chu hieng Jerusalem le Juda khawpuihai le a sûnga lalhai le rorêltuhai chu, vawisûn ni anga hi, anni chu râusan le maktia le, inchek- naa le, ṭawngsephura siem dingin;"
19,"Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;","Aigupta lal Pharao le a siehlaw- hai, a lalhai le a mihai po po leh;"
20,"and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;","mi chilakhai po po, Uz rama lalhai po po, Philistin mihai rama lal po pohai, (Askelon, Gaza, Ekron le Asdoda la mahlahai leh);"
21,"Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;","Edom, Moab le Ammon thlahai leh;"
22,"and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;","Zidon lalhai po po, Tura lalhai po po, tuisuoriet khêla thlierkâra lal- hai po po leh;"
23,"Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners of their hair cut off;","Dedan, Tema, Buz le an barêp hmul vâwtuhai po po leh;"
24,"and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness;",Arabia lalhai po po le thlalêra chêng mi chilakhai lalhai po po leh;
25,"and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;","Zimri lalhai po po, Elam lalhai po po, Media lalhai po po leh;"
26,"and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.","hmâr tienga lalhai a hla le hnaia mihai, pakhat khatin, hnuoi phêk chunga um khawvêla lalram po po hai leh: chun, Sesak lal chun anni zoa chun dâwn vêng a tih."
27,"And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.","Chun, an kuoma chun hieng hin tîng i ta: Israel Pathien, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Dâwn unla, inrui unla, inluok unla, tlu unla, tho nâwk ta naw ro, nangni laia kâwlhnâm ka hung tir ding lei chun."
28,"And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.","Chun, i kuta no chu dâwn dinga an nuom naw chun, an kuoma chun hieng hin tîng i tih: “Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: In dâwn ngei ding a nih,” tiin."
29,"For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Ngai ta, ka hming chawia khaw- pui inbûka uma chun thil ṭha naw ka thaw ṭan ta sih a, hrem dêr loin in um ding maw? Hrem lo ni naw ti niu; hnuoi hluotuhai po po chunga chun kâwlhnâm kân lêngtir ding a ni sih a, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
30,"Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.","Chuleiin, hieng thuhai po po hi anni kalin hril la, an kuoma chun, “LALPA chu chungtienga inthawkin hung inrûm a ta, a chêngna inthienga inthawk chun a râwl chu hung in- suong a tih; a hlo petna hmuna chun thilthawtheitakin inrûm a ta; grêp sir sâwrtuhai ang chun ama chu hnuoi chung hluotuhai po po chunga chun khêk a tih."
31,"A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, saith Jehovah.","Ri chu hnuoi tâwp chenah hung tlung a ta; LALPA chun hnamhai le chun inkalna an nei sih a; mi tin chu phût a ta; mi rilohai ruok chu kâwl- hnâm pêng a tih, LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
32,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, thil ṭha naw chu hnam khata inthawkin hnam dang chunga chun fe pei a ta, hnuoi tâwp- taka inthawk chun thlipui nasatak chu hung suok a tih."
33,"And the slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.","Chun, chu nia chun LALPA suk- hlumna chu hnuoi tâwp khing khata inthawka a tâwp khingtieng chen nîng a ta; chuonghai chu sûn ni naw ni hai a, lâk khâwm khawm ni naw ni hai a, phûm khawm ni bawk naw ni hai; leihnuoi chunga êk el ni lem an tih."
34,"Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow in ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.","Nangni berâmpuhai, inrûm unla, khêk ro; nangni ran ruol hotu- hai, vutah nangni le nangni intleng ro; that in nina ding ni chu a hung tlung tah a, nangni chu kei nâwi neng ka ti cheu a, bêl ditumtak angin tlûng in tih."
35,"And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.","Chun, berâmpuhai chun tlân- hmangna ding lampui nei naw ni hai a, ran ruol hotuhai khawm chun pumpelna ding nei bawk naw ni hai."
36,"A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Jehovah layeth waste their pasture.",Berâmpuhai khêk râwl ri le ran ruol hotuhai inrûm ri chu! LALPA chun an ran tlatna hmunhai chu a suksiet ta sih a.
37,And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.,"Chun, LALPA lunginsenna ṭiumna lei chun ran in muongum- takhai dâm chu an to ṭawk ṭawk a."
38,"He hath left his covert, as the lion; for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword, and because of his fierce anger.","Sakeibaknei angin a chîmbuk a mâksan a, a lunginsen ṭiumna lei le, nêksâwrna kâwlhnâm ṭiumna lei chun an ram chu a se zo ta sih a."
