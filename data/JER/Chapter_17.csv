6,"For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.","Ama chu thlalêra hlobuk ang nîng a ta, thil ṭha hung tlung khawm chu a hmu âwm si nawh a; amiruok- chu, thlalêra chun hmun ṭâwl lai lai chu hluong a ta, hluo ngai lo, chilung ram chu."

8,"For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that spreadeth out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat cometh, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.","Tuihai sîra thing phun, a zunghai khawm vadunga kai ang, lumna a hung tlung pha khawma ṭi lo, a hnahai hring zing lem, khaw inṭhâl kuma hai khawm pawisa lo, ra insuo zing hlak ang a nih."

11,"As the partridge that sitteth on eggs which she hath not laid, so is he that getteth riches, and not by right; in the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.","Indik loa hausaknahai neitu chu, varung ama awpkêu ni si lo te kei khâwmtu ang chu a nih; a dam sûng la la chun ama chu mâksan an ta, a tâwpa chun ama chu invêt nîng a tih."

13,"O Jehovah, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be put to shame. They that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters.","Aw LALPA, Israel beisei, nang- ma nghatsantuhai che chu inzak an tih; nangma mâksantuhai chu, LALPA, tuihring tuikhur chu an nghatsan tâk leiin hnuoia chun ziek nîng an tih."
14,"Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.","Aw LALPA, mi sukdam la, sukdamin um ka tih; mi sandam la, sandamin um ka tih; ka inpâkna chu nang i ni sih a."
15,"Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of Jehovah? let it come now.","Ngai ta, “LALPA thu chu khaw lai am a um a, tuhin hungtlung raw se,” an mi tih a."
16,"As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee; neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was before thy face.","Keia chungthua chun, nanga hnunga berâmpu ni chu ka tum ṭâl nawh a, ni chungpikum khawm chu ka châk bawk nawh a, i hriet a, ka hmûra inthawka suokhai chu i hmai- hmaa chun a um sih a."
17,Be not a terror unto me: thou art my refuge in the day of evil.,"Ka ta dingin ṭium ni naw la, ni ṭha nawa chun kân bîk himna i nih."
18,"Let them be put to shame that persecute me, but let not me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed; bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.","Kei mi sukrinumtuhai chu in- zakhai sienla, kei ruok chu mîn zaktir naw rawh; anni chu inbeidawngtir la, kei ruok chu mi sukbeidawng naw rawh; an chunga chun ni ṭha naw chu hung intlungtir la, anni sietna thuo hniin sukse rawh."
19,"Thus said Jehovah unto me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;","LALPA chun ka kuoma chun hieng hin a hril a: “Fe la, chu hnam thlahai dai kawtkhâr, Juda lalhai an hung lûtna le an fe suokna le, Jerusalem dai kawtkhârahai po po chun va ngîr rawh;"
20,"and say unto them, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:","chun, an kuoma chun hril la: Nangni Juda lalhai le, Juda po pohai le, Jerusalem hluotu hi dai kawt- khâra lût hlakhai po po, LALPA thu hi lo hre ta u:"
21,"Thus saith Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: In hringna thuah fîmkhur unla, châwlni chun phur phur naw unla, Jerusalem dai kawtkhâra chun hung la lût bawk naw ro;"
22,"neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work: but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.","châwlni chun in inhaia in- thawkin phur phur suok bawk naw unla, sin ieng ang khawm thaw bawk naw ro; amiruokchu, in thlatuhai thu ka pêk ta ang khan, châwlni chu inser ro;"
23,"But they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.","nisienlakhawm, an ngai nawh a, an na khawm an sit nawh a, an rîng an sukngar a, an hriet nawna ding le inchûktirna chu an pawm nawna dingin."
24,"And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;","Chun, ṭhahnemngaitaka ka thu in ngai chun, LALPA chun a tih, châwlnia hi khawpui dai kawtkhâr- haia phur hung la lût lo ding le, amiruokchu, châwlni chu insera, chu nia sin thaw lo dingin;"
25,"then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain for ever.","hi dai kawtkhârhaia hin lalhai le rorêltuhai David lalṭhungphaa ṭhunghai chu sakawr tawlailîr le sakawr chunga chuongin, anni le an rorêltuhai le Juda mihai le Jerusalem hluotuhai chu la lût an tih; chun, hi khawpui hi kumkhuoin um zing bawk a tih."
26,"And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill-country, and from the South, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meal-offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving, unto the house of Jehovah.","Chun, Juda ram khawpuihaia inthawk dâm, Jerusalem vêl khuo- haia inthawk dâm, Benjamin rama inthawk dâm, phai ram le tlâng rama inthawk dâm, Sim rama inthawk dâmin, LALPA ina lâwmthu hrilna inthâwinahai, berâm dâm, inthâwina hrim hrim dâm, bu thilinhlân dâm, pumrawhmang thilinhlân dâm chu hung chawiin hung an tih."
27,"But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.","Amiruokchu, châwlni chu in- sera, châwlnia Jerusalem dâi kawt- khârhaia phur phura lût lo dinga ka thu in ngai naw chun, chutaka dâi kawtkhâra chun mei sêm ka ta, Jerusalem in ropuihai chu kâng- hmang a ta, sukmit ni ngai hrim hrim naw ni."
