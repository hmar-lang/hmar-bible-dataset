1,"(in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;","Juda ram lal Zedekia inlal kum kuona, thla sâwmnaa chun Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chu a sipaihai po po leh Jerusalemah a hung a, a hung rûn tah a;"
2,"in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city),","chun, Zedekia inlal kum sâwm- pakhatna, thla lina, chu thla ni kuo ni chun chu khawpuia chun suksietna chu a um tah a."
3,"that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, to wit, Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.","Jerusalem lâk a ni ni chun, Babulon lal rorêltuhai po po chu an hung lût a, dai kawtkhâr lailung, Nergal-sarezera dâm, Samgar-neboa dâm, Sarsekima dâm, Rabsarisa dâm, Rabmaga dâm, Babulon lal rorêltu dang po pohai le chun an ṭhung tâwl a."
4,"And it came to pass that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.","Chun, Juda ram lal Zedekia le indo mihai po po chun chu chu an hmu chun an tlânseh a, kul pahni inkâra dai kawtkhârah, lal huon lampuia chun a zân a zân chun an tlânsuok tah a; chuongchun, ama chu Araba lampuia khan a feh a."
5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.","Nisienlakhawm, Kaldai sipaihai chun anni chu an hnawt a, Zedekia chu Jeriko phairuoma chun an hnawt phâk a, chun, ama chu an man chun, Hamath rama Riblaa Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a, ama chun a chungah ro a rêlthlûk a."
6,Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.,"Riblaa chun a mithmu ngeiah Nebukadnezzar chun Zedekia naupa- salhai chu a that a; chun, Babulon lal chun Juda mi ṭhahai po po khawm chu a that bawk a."
7,"Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.","Chu nawa khawm chun, Zedekia mithai chu a kheldawk a, thîrkawl ân buntir a, Babulona ṭhuoi ding- in."
8,"And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.","Chun, Kaldaihai chun lal in le mihai inhai chu meiin an rawh a, Jerusalem kulbanghai chu an sukchim tah a."
9,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained.","Chun, Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun khawpuia mi la um sunhai le, tlân hmangtuhai le, ama kuoma hung lûthai le, mipui a la mahla la um sunhai po chu Babulon tieng chun salah a ṭhuoi tah a."
10,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.","Nisienlakhawm, Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu chun mi rimsihai iengkhawm nei lohai chu Juda rama chun a mâksan a, grêp huonhai le lohai anni chu a pêk nghâl tâwl bawk a."
11,"Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,","Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chun Jeremia chu Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu, kuoma chun enkawl dingin a pêk a,"
12,"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.","“Ṭhuoi la, ama hi ṭhatakin enkawl la, sukpawi naw rawh; ami- ruokchu, i kuoma a hril ang ang chun thawpêk lem rawh,” a ta."
13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;","Chuongchun, Nebuzaradan, vêngtu pâwl hotu le Nebusazban, Rabsaris, Nergal-sarezer, Rabmag le Babulon lal rorêltuhai po po chun,"
14,"they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he dwelt among the people.","mi an tir a, Jeremia chu vêng- tuhai kulbînga inthawk chun an ṭhuoi suok a, Saphan naupa Ahikam, chu naupa Gedalia kuoma chun an pêk a, in tienga ṭhuoi dingin; chuong- chun, mipuihai laia chun a um ve tah a."
15,"Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung a, vêngtuhai kulbînga khum a ni lai khan,"
16,"Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day.","“Fe la, Ethiopia mi Ebed-melek kuoma khan hieng hin va hril rawh, Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, thil ṭha tiengah ni lovin, thil ṭha naw tiengah hi khawpui chunga hin ka thuhai chu ka hung intlungtir ding a nih; chun, chu nia chun nanga hmaa chun suk- kim nîng an tih."
17,"But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.","Nisienlakhawm, nang chu, chu ni chun sansuok ka ti cheh a, mi iṭihai kuta chun pêk ni naw ti ni, LALPA chun a tih."
18,"For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah.","Sandam ngei ngei ka ti cheh a, kâwlhnâmah i tlu naw ding a ni sih a; amiruokchu, i hringna chu nangma ta dinga sanhim nîng a tih; i ringna chu keimaa hin i sie leiin, LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
