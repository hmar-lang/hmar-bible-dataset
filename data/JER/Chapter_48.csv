1,"Of Moab. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe unto Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken down.","Moab chungthu chu, Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih “Nebo chu a chung a rik! suksiet a ni ta sih a; Kiriathaim chu sukzakin a um a, lâkin a um tah a; Misgab chu sukzakin a um a, sukchimin a um ta bawk a."
2,"The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue thee.","Moab inpâkna chu a um ta nawh a; Hesbona chun a chungah thil ṭha naw chu an rawt a, ‘Thaw ro, hnam ninaa inthawkin ama chu sât thlâng ei tiu,’ tiin. Nang khawm Aw Madmen, sukto ṭawk la nîng i tih; kâwlhnâmin hung hnawt bawk a ti che."
3,"The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction!","Horonaima inthawka khêkri chu, suksietna le sukbohmangna nasatak a nih a!"
4,Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.,"Moab chu suksiet a ni tah a, a têhai chun khêkri hriet dingin an hung thawh a."
5,For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.,Luhith hang fenaa chun ṭap pum zing zingin an hang fe hlak ding a ni sih a; Horonaim zuk fenaa chun sukbohmangna khêkri rinum tuor ri chu an hriet sih a.
6,"Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.","Tlân hmang unla, in hringnahai chu sanhim unla, thlalêra sabeng- tung ang chu ni unla."
7,"For, because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together.","I sinthawhaia le i roa chun i ringna în nghat leiin, nang khawm man nîng i ta; Kemos khawm chu sala intâng dingin fêng a ta, a thiempuhai le a rorêltuhai leh."
8,"And the destroyer shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as Jehovah hath spoken.","Khawpui tina chun suksetu hung tlung a ta, khawpui ieng khawm suokthleng naw ni, phairuomhai khawm chu suksiet nîng a ta, phai- zâwl khawm chu sukbohmang nîng a tih; LALPAIN a hril ta angin."
9,"Give wings unto Moab, that she may fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein.","Moab kuoma chun a vuong hmang theina dingin thlahai pe la: a khawpuihai chu râusan a ni ding a na, mi a chêng hrim hrim um loin."
10,Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently; and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.,LALPA sin hmusittaka thawtu chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se; thisen insuo dinga a kâwlhnâm la kîrtu chu ṭawngsephurin um bawk raw se.
11,"Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remaineth in him, and his scent is not changed.","Moab chu a naupang laia in- thawk tah nuomsain a um a, a mawng inkhâwnah a um a, bêl khata inthawka bêl danga inruokin a um nawh a, sala khawm ân tâng bawk nawh a, chuleiin, a rim chu amaa chun a um zing a, a riminhnikna chu a danglam nawh."
12,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will send unto him them that pour off, and they shall pour him off; and they shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.","“Chuleiin, ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung mêk, LALPA chun a tih; ama kuoma chun bunthlatuhai chu tir ka ta, anni chun ama chu bun- thlâng an tih, a bûrhai chu sukruok an ta, a bûrhai chu suknawi dar an tih."
13,"And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.","An ringtak Bethel chu Israel sûngkaw ta dinga inzapuium a ni ang khan, Moab chu Kemos chun inzapui a tih."
14,"How say ye, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?","‘Mi thilthawthei, indonaa mi hrât khawkhênghai ei nih,’ ieng tin am in ti thei a?"
15,"Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into his cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.","Moab chu suksietin a um a, a khawpuihai hlak chu meiin a khuh a, a tlangvâlhai hlak chu that thlâk zo an ni tah a, Laltak, a hming sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
16,"The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.","Moab lunginzîngna ding chu a hung tlung vâng vâng tah a, suk- rinuma a umna ding khawm chu a hung inhmaw tah."
17,"All ye that are round about him, bemoan him, and all ye that know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!","Nangni a vêla um po pohai, ama chu ṭa unla, a hming hretuhai po po chun, ‘Lalhmawl ngartak el, hmawl mawitak el chu iengtiziea tliek el am a na?’ ti ro."
18,"O thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moab is come up against thee, he hath destroyed thy strongholds.","“Aw nang Dibona chêng naunu- hmei, i ropuinaa inthawkin hung thla la, dangchârin ṭhung rawh; Moab suksetu chu i chungah a hung tlung a, i kul nghethai chu a suksiet ta sih a."
19,"O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch: ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What hath been done?","Aw Aroer hluotuhai, lampui sîrah ngîr unla, enthlit ro; a suok- thleng ta le, a tlân hmanghai kha indawn unla, ‘Ieng am thaw a ni ta leh?’ ti ro."
20,"Moab is put to shame; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell ye it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.","Moab chu sukzakin a um a; suksiet a ni ta sih a; ṭap inrûm unla, ṭap ro; Arnona chun va hril unla, Moab suksieta a um tâk thu chu."
21,"And judgment is come upon the plain country, upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath,","“Phaizâwl ram chunga chun rorêlna a hung tlung a; Holon chunga dâm, Jahza chunga dâm, Mephaath chunga dâm;"
22,"and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,","Dibon chunga dâm, Nebo chunga dâm, Beth-diblathaim chung- a dâm;"
23,"and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,","Kiriathaim chunga dâm, Beth- gamul chunga dâm, Beth-meon chunga dâm;"
24,"and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.","Kerioth chunga dâm, Bozra chunga dâm; Moab rama khawpui hla le hnaiahai po po chunga dâm chun."
25,"The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith Jehovah.","Moab mi chu sât thlâk a na, a bân khawm chu sukthliek a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
26,"Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against Jehovah: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.","“Ama chu vairui ta u, LALPA chu dodâlin ama le ama ân chawi- mawi sih a; Moab chu ama luoka ngei chun inbuol a ta, ama chu mi hrilin- sîm hung ni bawk a tih."
27,"For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for as often as thou speakest of him, thou waggest the head.","Nanga ta ding chun Israel chu hrilinsîm a ni naw am a nih? Inruhai lai hmu a ni am a nih? Ama thu chu i hril poleh, lu i lei el sih a."
28,"O ye inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that maketh her nest over the mouth of the abyss.","“Aw Moab hluotuhai, khawpui- hai chu mâksan unla, râwlahai chun va chêng ro; pûk bau sîra a bu septu vâṭhu ang chu ni ro."
29,"We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogancy, and the haughtiness of his heart.","Moab chapona chu kan hriet a, a chapo êm êm el a; ân suksângna le, a chapona le, a uongna le, a lungrila uongthuongna le chun."
30,"I know his wrath, saith Jehovah, that it is nought; his boastings have wrought nothing.","A lunginsenna chu ka hriet a, LALPA chun a tih; iengkhawm a ni nawh a; a chapona chun iengkhawm a thawdawk nawh."
31,"Therefore will I wail for Moab; yea, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall they mourn.","Chuleiin, Moab ta ding chun ka ṭap inrûm ding a nih; anih, Moab po po ta ding chun khêk ka tih; Kir-heres mihai chu ka ṭa ding a ni sih a."
32,"With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: thy branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage the destroyer is fallen.","Aw Sibmaa grêphrui, Jazer ta dinga ṭap nêk hmana nasa khan i ta dingin ṭap ka ta; i kauhai chun tui- suoriet râl an kai a, Jazer tuisuoriet chu an va tlung hiel a; i nipui theihai chunga le i grêp rahai chunga chun suksetu a tlung tah a."
33,And gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting.,Moab rama inthawk le lo rahlâwkna hmunhaia inthawk chun hlimna le lâwmna dâm chu lâk hmang a ni tah a; uoin sâwrna khurhaia inthawk chu uoin chu kân kangtir tah a; tukhawma khêk pumin sirsâwr naw ni hai a; khêk ri khawm chu lâwmna khêk ri ni naw ni.
34,"From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate.","“Hesbona inthawka Elea chen le, Jahaz chen rauin khêkria inthawk chun an râwl an insuo a, Zoara in- thawka Horonaim chen, Eglath-selesia chenin; Nimrim vadunghai khawm chu râusanin a um ding a ni sih a."
35,"Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith Jehovah, him that offereth in the high place, and him that burneth incense to his gods.","Chu nawa khawm, Moaba chun bâwlhmuna thilinhlân le, ama pathien kuoma riminhnik râwtu chu suktâwp ka tih, LALPA chun a tih."
36,"Therefore my heart soundeth for Moab like pipes, and my heart soundeth like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished.","Chuleiin, Moab ta dingin ka lung chu theihle angin ân rih a, Kir- heresa mihai ta dingin ka lung chu theihle angin ân ri a nih; chuleiin, tamtak a ihmu tahai khawm chu a bohmang tah a nih."
37,"For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.","“Lu tin chu a kâwk a, khâkhmul tin kildein a um a; kut po pohai chun thil chepnawi an chawi a; kâwnghai chunga chun saiip puonhai a um bawk a."
38,"On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof there is lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein none delighteth, saith Jehovah.","Moab in chungsâng tinahai le, kawtthlêrahai hmun tinah ṭap ri a um a; Moab chu bêl ditna umlo ang chun ka sukkhawi tah a, LALPA chun a tih."
39,How is it broken down! how do they wail! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab become a derision and a terror to all that are round about him.,"Ieng anga sukkhawi am a na? Ieng angin am an ṭap inrûm a? Moab chun inzak leiin iengtin am a hnung- innghat el a; chuongchun, Moab chu a vêla umhai ta ding chun lungsuk- zîngna le hrilinsîm nîng a tih."
40,"For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out his wings against Moab.","“LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Ngai ta u, mupui angin vuong a ta, Moab chunga chun a thlahai zâr a tih."
41,"Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.","Kerioth chu lâkin a um a, kul dethai chu maktiin an um a; chu ni chun Moab mi thilthawthei lungril chu nuhmei na tuor lai lungril ang nîng a tih."
42,"And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against Jehovah.","Chun, Moab chu LALPA do- dâla ân chawimawi leiin, hnam ninaa inthawka sukbohmang nîng a tih."
43,"Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith Jehovah.","Ṭitna le, khurthim le, châng chu i chungah a um, Aw Moab ram hluotu, LALPA chun a tih."
44,"He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon him, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.","Ṭitnaa inthawka tlân chu khur- thima chun tlâng a ta, khurthima inthawka suok chu chânga chun âwk a tih; anni hremna kum chu ama chungah, Moab chunga ngei chun, kân tlungtir ding a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
45,"They that fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon; for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.","Chuong a tlân hmanghai chu hrâtna nei loin, Hesbon hlima chun an ngîr a, mei chu Hesbona inthawk chun a fe suok a, meichawk chu Sihona inthawkin a fe suok a, Moab ram sîr le, chawkbuoituhai lua lallu- khum chu a kâng hmang tah a."
46,"Woe unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone; for thy sons are taken away captive, and thy daughters into captivity.","Aw Moab, i chung a va rik de! Kemosa mihai chu hmanglo an nih, i naupasalhai chu sala ṭhuoiin an um a, i naunuhmeihai khawm chu salah an intâng sih a."
47,"Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith Jehovah. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.","Nisienlakhawm, Moab sal in- tângna chu nakie tieng niahai chun la hung la kîr nâwk ka tih, LALPA chun a tih” tiin. Moab chunga rorêlna chu chuong chen chu a nih."
