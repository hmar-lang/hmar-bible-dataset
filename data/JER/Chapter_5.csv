1,"Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth justly, that seeketh truth; and I will pardon her.","Jerusalem kawtthlêrahai chun hmatieng hnungtieng tlân unla, tuhin va en ta u! chutaka hmun lienahai chun va zawng unla, va hre ta u, mi hrim in va hmuin, mi thil indiktaka thaw a, thudik zawng hrim an um am; chun, chuong a ni chun ngaidam ka tih."
2,"And though they say, As Jehovah liveth; surely they swear falsely.","“LALPA chu a hring zing angin,” an ti dea chu, inkhêl letdêra inkhâm el an nih."
3,"O Jehovah, do not thine eyes look upon truth? thou hast stricken them, but they were not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.","Aw LALPA, i mit chun thudik chu a hmu a ni naw am a nih? Anni chu i vuok a, amiruokchu, an lungngai nawh a; anni chu i fâk zo a, anachu, sukdikna chu an dangkîr sih a, an hmêlhai chu lungpui nêka ngarin an siem a, hungkîr chu an nuom naw a nih."
4,"Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, nor the law of their God:","Chun, kei chun, “Matheiloin, hienghai hi mi rimsi an na; invêt an nih: an Pathien rorêl amani, LALPA lampui amani khawm chu an hriet si nawh a."
5,"I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of Jehovah, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.","Mi lienhai kuoma chun fêng ka ta, an kuoma chun thu hril ka tih; anni chun chu an Pathien rorêl le, LALPA lampui chu an hriet sih a,” ka tih a. Nisienlakhawm, hienghai hin lungril hmunkhatin rîngkawl chu an sukthliek a, khuopnahai chu an suktan tah a."
6,"Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.","Chuleiin, ramhnuoia sakeibak- nei chun anni chu sukhlum a ta, zântieng huna satenehai chun anni chu suksieng an tih, chun, keitê chun an khawpuihai chu nghâk a ta, mi tukhawm chutaka inthawka suok taphawthai chu keinawiin um an ta, an bawsietnahai chu a tam êm leiin le, an hnungtawlnahai chu a hung pung ta pei leiin."
7,"How can I pardon thee? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots’ houses;","Iengtin am ngaidam thei ka ti cheh a? I thlahai chun an mi nghat- san tah a, pathien ni lohaia chun an inkhâm tah a; khawptaka ka châwm lai khawmin, an uire tah a, nawchi- zawr inahai chun a pâwl pâwlin anni chu an inkhâwm tâwl a."
8,they were as fed horses roaming at large; every one neighed after his neighbor’s wife.,Zîngkâra sakawr vaikhawphai ang an nih; mi tin chun a tuolbâwm nuhmei chu inhnarin an inhrâm a.
9,Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?,Hieng thilhai lei hin ka hung hrem naw ding am a nih? LALPA chun a tih; ka thlarau chun hieng ang hnam chunga hin phuba a lâk naw ding am a nih?
10,"Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Jehovah’s.","“Grêp tlar lai chun hang fe unla, sukse ro; tâwp ṭhuoina ruok chu thaw naw unla, a kauhai chu la thla unla, LALPA ta an ni si nawh a."
11,"For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith Jehovah.","Israel sûngkuo le Juda sûngkuo chun ka chungah khawhlotakin an lo thaw ta sih a,” LALPA chun a tih."
12,"They have denied Jehovah, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:","LALPA chu an lo inphatsan a, “Ama a ni nawh; thil ṭha naw chu ei chungah hung tlung chuong naw ni; ṭâm amanih, kâwlhnâm amani khawm hmu chuong nâwm ei ni;"
13,"and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.","zâwlneihai khawm chu thli el an na, annia chun thu a um nawh; an kuoma chun chuong anga thaw chu nîng a tih,” an tih a."
14,"Wherefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.","Chuleiin, LALPA, sipaihai Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Hieng thuhai hi in hril leiin, ngai ta, i baua chun ka thuhai chu meiah inchangtir ka ta, hi mipuihai hi a thingah, chuongchun, anni chu kânghmang a tih."
15,"Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.","Ngai ta, hlataka inthawkin i chungah hnam hung ṭhuoi ka ta, Aw Israel sûngkuo, LALPA chun a tih; hnam hrâttak nîng a ta, hnam hluitak el ni bawk a ta; hnam an ṭawng khawm i hriet lo le, an hril khawm i hriet lo nîng a tih."
16,"Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.","An thal bâwmhai chu thlân in- hawng ang a na, mi hrât khawkhêng ruok an nih."
17,"And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat; they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees; they shall beat down thy fortified cities, wherein thou trustest, with the sword.","Anni chun i lohma suok le i bu fâng an ta, i naupasalhai le i naunu- hmeihai fâk ding ngei chu; berâm ruolhai le i bâwng ruolhai chu fa zo vawng an tih; i theichang kûng hai le i grêphruihai chu fa zo an ta, i khawpui kulneihai kâwlhnâm le i în hnêmnahai chu sukchim an tih."
18,"But even in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong niahai khawm chun, i tâwp dêrna ding chu thaw naw ning, LALPA chun a tih."
19,"And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah our God done all these things unto us? then shalt thou say unto them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.","Chun, i mihaiin, “Iengdinga LALPA ei Pathien chun ei chungah hienghai hi a thaw am a na?” an ti pha chun, hieng ang hin anni chu dawn i tih, “Kei in mi lo nghatsan a, in rama chun pathien danglamhai rawng chu in lo bâwl ta ang khan, ram in ta ni ngai loa chun mi hmêl- makhai rawng chu in bâwl ding a nih,” tiin."
20,"Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,","Jakob sûngkuoa chun hi hi hril unla, Juda rama chun phuongdar ro;"
21,"Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; that have eyes, and see not; that have ears, and hear not:","Aw hrietthiemna boa mi invêt- hai, tuhin hi hi lo ngai ta u; mithai nei sia, hmu lohai, nahai nei sia hre lohai;"
22,"Fear ye not me? saith Jehovah: will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it.","Kei chu in mi ṭi naw maw? LALPA chun a tih; Keia hmaihmaa, kumkhaw thupêk anga a liem thei nawna dinga tuisuoriet khuopnaa phaiphin sietu hmaah in inthin naw ding maw? chutaka tuifâwnhai chu an hang innawk hlaka chu, a liem thei si nawh a; an inrûm hlaka chu an fe khêl thei bawk si nawh."
23,But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.,"Amiruokchu, hi hnam hin lungril hel le, lungril inher an nei a, an hel a, an fe tah a."
24,"Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; that preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.","An lungril khawma, “LALPA ei Pathien, a huntaka ruo hmasa le nuhnung petu, ei ta dinga busîk hun haptahai mi ruotpêktu chu ṭing ei tiu,” khawm an ti dêr nawh."
25,"Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good from you.","In suolnahai chun hieng thilhai hi a hnawt hmang a, in suolnahai chun nangnia inthawk chun ṭhatna- hai chu a chelkîrpêk cheu a ni hi."
26,"For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.","Ka mihai laia chun mi rilohai hmu a na; anni chun vate mantuhaiin an inchân angin an inchân a; châng an kam a, mihai chu an man a."
27,"As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxed rich.","Bâwm chu vatehaia a sip angin, an inhai chu inhlêmnain a sip a; chuleiin, an hung lienin an hung hausa a."
28,"They are waxed fat, they shine: yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they plead not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.","An hung thâu a, an tlawr a, anih, khawhlona thilthawhai chu an thiem zâk a, a chungthu angin, pa neilohai chungthua chun an ṭan nawh a, an hlawtlingna dingin; mi tlasamhai thuneina chu an ngaisak nawh a."
29,Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?,Hieng thilhai lei hin ka hung hrem naw ding am a nih? LALPA chun a tih; hnam hieng ang chunga hin ka thlarau chun phuba a lâk naw ding am a nih?
