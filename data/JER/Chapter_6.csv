6,"For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a lo ti ta sih a: Thinghai chu phûr thlu unla, Jerusalem chunga chun pil dêngpâwnghai chu siem ro, hi hi khawpui hremna ding chu a na, a sûnga chun innêksâwrna ringawt el a nih."
7,"As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.","Tuisunsuo chun a tuihai a phu- suok angin, a khawhlonahai chu a phusuok a; a sûnga chun inpâwng- nêkna le suksietna hriet a na, ka hmaa chun natna le hliemnahai chu a um zing zing a nih."

10,"To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.","An hriet theina dingin tu kuom am thuhrilin hrilfieng ka ta? Ngai ta, an nahai chu verlo an na, an hriet thei hrim hrim nawh! ngai ta, LALPA thu chu an kuoma chun inhalna ang chau a na, amaa chun lâwmna hrim an nei nawh."
11,"Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.","Chuleiin, LALPA lunginsenna chun ka sip a; insûm zing chu ka nghawk a nih; kawtthlêra chun nau- panghai laia chun bunthla la, tlang- vâl inkhâwmhai laia le chun; pasal chu a nuhmei le chun lâk nîng an ta, mi upatak le tartak khawm."
12,"And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.","Chun, an inhai, an lohai, an nuhmeihai chu mi danghai kuoma pêk nîng an ta; ram hluotuhai chunga chun ka kut kân let ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
13,For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.,"Anni laia a chîn taka inthawka anni laia a lien tak chenin, inîtthîk tuonain an sip a; zâwlneihaia in- thawka thiempuhai chen khawmin, mi tin el chun indik lotakin an thawh a."

19,"Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.","Aw leihnuoi, lo hre ta, ngai ta, ka thuhai chu an ngai naw leiin hi hnam chunga hin thil ṭha naw, an ngaituonahai ra ngei chu kân tlungtir ding a nih; ka dân hlak chu an lo hnâwl a."
20,"To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.","Ram hlataka inthawka mafuhai le, Seba-a inthawka berawhai chu ieng kawngroa ka kuoma hung am an ni leh?

21,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, hi hnam hmaa hin tlûkna lunghai chu sieng ka ta, chuong chunga chun pahai le naupa- salhai chu insuithlu hmunkhat an ta; tuolbâwm le a ruol khawm chu bohmang bawk an tih."
22,"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ngai ta, Hmâr tieng rama inthawkin hnam pakhat a hung a, leihnuoi kil khâwrtaka inthawk chun hnam ropuitak chu suktho nîng a tih."
23,"They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.","Thalngul le fei an chawi a; an râwng hle a, lunginsietna hrim an nei dêr nawh; an râwl chu tuisuoriet angin ân hawk a, anni chu sakawr chunghaia chun an chuong a; mi tin el chu indonaa angin, i chunga chun, aw Zion naunu, an hung intlar a nih."
24,"We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pangs as of a woman in travail.","Chu thuthang chu kan lo hriet a; kan kuthai chu a hung châu a, lungzîngna chun keini a mi man a, nuhmei nauhase nat tuor ang el chun keini chu a mi chip a nih."
25,"Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, and terror, are on every side.","Lohaia chun fe suok naw unla, lampuia khawm chun fe naw ro; hmêlma kâwlhnâm le ṭitumna chu sîr tin ela chun a um sih a."
26,"O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.","Aw ka chipui naunu, saiip puonin inbel la, pilvuta chun inbuol rawh; naupasal khât sûn angin sûn la, sûnna natak el chun, ei chunga chun suksetu chu a hung vak ding a ni sih a."
27,I have made thee a trier and a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.,"Ka mihai laia chun vêngna in insânga le kulpuiah ka siem cheh a, an lampui chu i hriet a, i fie theina dingin."

29,The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.,"Pûmthei chu ṭiumtakin ân thlih a, suon chu mei ikâng hmang chun a um a, a thlâwn elin sukfainaa chun an feh a, mi rilohai chu lâk hmang an ni si nawh a."
