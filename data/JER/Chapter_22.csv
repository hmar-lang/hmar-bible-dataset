1,"Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Juda lal ina chun fe thla la, chutaka chun hi thu hi zu hril rawh:"
2,"and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates.","Aw nang Juda lal, David lal- ṭhungphaa ṭhung, nang le i siehlaw- hai le i mihai, hieng dai kawtkhâr- haia lûthai hin LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u."
3,"Thus saith Jehovah: Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the sojourner, the fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Felna le rorêlna chu tirsuok unla, nêksâwrtu kuta inthawk suksieta um chu sansuok ro; thil dik naw chu thaw naw unla, thawluina chu thaw naw unla, hmeithaihai le, mikhuolhai le pa neilohai chunga chun; hi hmuna hin mi thiem thisen chu insuo bawk naw ro."
4,"For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.","Hieng thilhai hi in thaw ngei ngei chun, hi hi dai kawtkhârahai hin, David lalṭhungphaa ṭhung lalhai, sakawr tawlailîra le sakawr chung- haia chuong, ama le a siehlawhai le a mihai, lût um an tih."
5,"But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation.","Nisienlakhawm, hieng thuhai hi in ngai naw chun, LALPA chun a tih: keima ngei insâlin kân khâm a, hi in hi rausan ni ngei a tih."
6,"For thus saith Jehovah concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon; yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.","Juda lal in chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Ka ta ding chun Gilead i na, Lebanon lu leh; nisienlakhawm, matheiloin thla- lêra le khawpui hluo loah ka siem ding che a nih."
7,"And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.","I chunga chun suksetuhai, mi tin el chu mâni hriemhrei seng leh, ka buotsai ding a nih; anni chun i ditthlang sidar dâm chu sât thlâng an ta, meiah tîng an tih."
8,"And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this great city?","Hnam tamtakhai chun hi khaw- pui hi fekhêl an ta, mi tin chun mâni tuolbâwm kuoma chun, “Iengtiziea hi khawpui ropuitak hi LALPAIN hieng- a a thaw el am a na?” tîng an tih."
9,"Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.","Chun, anni chun, “LALPA an Pathien thuthlung chu an nghatsan a, pathien danghai an biek a, an rawng an bâwl leiin a nih,” tiin dawn an tih."
10,"Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him that goeth away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.","Mithi ta dingin ṭap naw unla, ama chu sûn bawk naw ro; ami- ruokchu, mi a fe hmang ta ding chun nasatakin ṭap unla; ama chu a hung kîr ta naw ding lei le, a piengna ram chu a hmu ta naw ding leiin."
11,"For thus saith Jehovah touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more;","Juda lal Josia naupa Sallum a pa aia rorêla, hi hmun mâksantu chungthua chun LALPA chun hieng- hin a ti sih a:"
12,"but in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.","“Hitaka hin ama chu hung kîr nâwk ta naw ni; amiruokchu, ama chu sala an ṭhuoina hmuna chun, chutaka chun thîng a ta, hi ram hi hmu nâwk ta naw ni,” tiin."
13,"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbor’s service without wages, and giveth him not his hire;","A in fel nawnaa bâwltu le, a pindanhai indik lonaa bâwltu chu a chung a rik; ama chun a tuolbâwm sinthawna chu man boin a hmang a, a hlaw khawm a pêk nawh a;"
14,"that saith, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.","ama chun, “In lientak ka ta dingin bâwl ka ta, pindan chung- hnung lien tâwktak hai leh” a ta. Chuongchun, tukverhai a siem a, sidar thingin a sûng ân thuo a, rawng sen a nâl a."
15,"Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him.","Sidara în huon khum leiin lalah în ngai am a nih? I pa chun a fâkin a dâwn a, indikna le rorêlna chu a thaw a ni nâwm a nih? Chuongchun, ama ta ding chun a hung ṭhah a."
16,He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.,"Mi tlasamhai le mi rimsihai chungthu chu a rêl a, chuongchun, a ṭhah a. Hi hi keima mi hre dingin a ni nâwm a nih? LALPA chun a tih."
17,"But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.","Amiruokchu, nanga mithai le i lungril chu inhnarna le, mi thiem thisen insuona ding le, nêksâwrna ding le, thawluina ding le, chu chu thawnaa ding chau naw chu thil dang ding a ni nawh a."
18,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him, saying Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!","Chuleiin, Juda lal Josia naupa Jehoiakim chungthua chun LALPAIN hieng hin a tih: Ama chu “Aw ka unaupa,” tiin amanih, “Aw farnu,” tiin amanih, sûn naw ni hai a; “Aw lalpa,” tiin amanih, “Aw a ropuina chu,” tiin amanih, sûn bawk naw ni hai."
19,"He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.","Sabengtung phûm angin phûm an ta, Jerusalem dai kawtkhârhai khêla hnûka kei dawkin."
20,"Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all thy lovers are destroyed.","Lebanona chun hang fe la, hang khêk rawh: Basana inthawk chun i râwl insuo la, Abarima inthawk chun khêk rawh: i hmangaihai po po chu an bohmang vawng ta sih a."
21,"I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.","I vângneinaa chun i kuomah thu ka hril a; amiruokchu, nang chun, “Ngai naw ning,” i tih a. I naupang laia inthawk tah hi hi i khawsak dân a ni hrim a; ka râwl hi i ngai ngai nawh."
22,"The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.","I berâmpuhai po po chu thliin châwm a ta, i hmangaihai chu salah intâng an tih: chu pha chun mathei- loin, i khawhlonahai po po lei chun inzak i ta, buoi ngei ngei i tih."
23,"O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!","Aw Lebanon hluotu, sidar thinghaia bu septu, nuhmei nauhase nat anga natna, i chunga tuornahai a hung tlung pha chun lungsiet i va um âwm de!"
24,"As I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;","LALPA chun, ka hring zing angin, Jehoiakim naupa Konia chu ka kut changtienga kutsebi sûng- phûm ni sienla khawm, chutaka inthawk chun hmalthlâng ka ti che;"
25,"and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.","chun, nangma hringna zawng- tuhai kuta le, i ṭi Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar le Kaldaihai kuta chun pêng ka ti che."
26,"And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.","Peisuok ka ti cheh a, i nu chun ram dangah paw lût a ti cheh a, i piengna ram ni loa chun, chutaka chun thîng i tih."
27,"But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, thither shall they not return.","Nisienlakhawm, ram an lung- rilin kîr an nuomna tieng chun kîr nâwk naw ni hai."
28,"Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein none delighteth? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?","Hi Konia hi bêl kawi hmusitum am a nih? Ama hi bêl amaa ditna um hlek lo am a nih? Iengdinga pei suoka, ama le a chihai, an ihriet naw rama chu pei suoka um am an na?"
29,"O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.","Aw leihnuoi, leihnuoi, leihnuoi, LALPA thu chu ngai ta."
30,"Thus saith Jehovah, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall a man of his seed prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hi pa hi nau boah, a dam sûnga mi hlawtling ngai lo dingin ziek rawh, ama chia mi hrim hrim hi tukhawm hlawtling ngai naw ni hai; David lalṭhungphaa ṭhung thua le, Juda rama ro la rêl pei ding thuah."
