1,"They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, will he return unto her again? will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith Jehovah.","“Miin a nuhmei a mâk a, ama chu a mâksan a, pasal dang ta a hung ni tah a, amapa chu amanu kuoma chun a lût nâwk ding am a nih? Chuong a ni chun chu ram chu nasa- taka sukpawrche a ni naw ding maw? Nang khawm chu, ngaizâwng tam- takhai le chun nawchizawr angin i lo khawsa tah a, anachu, ka kuoma bawk i hung kîr nâwk ding? LALPA chun a tih."
2,"Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.","Bâwlhmun tienghai khi i mithai khan hang thlîr la, en ta; an zâlpui nawna che khaw lai am a um a? Thlalêra Arabia mi ang elin, lampui sîra chun an ta dingin i ṭhung a; i rîtlona le i hurna chun ram chu i sukpawrche ta a nih."
3,"Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hadst a harlot’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.","Chuleiin, raw sûrhai chu chel- tâng an na, ruo nuhnung tieng chu a um ta naw a nih; amiruokchu, mi hur chal chu i nei a, inzak i tum dêr si nawh a."
4,"Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?","Tuta inthawk hin, ‘Ka pa, nang chu ka tleirâwlna ṭhuoitu i nih,’ tiin ka kuomah i khêk naw dîm a nih?"
5,"Will he retain his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and hast had thy way.","A lunginsenna chu a kawl zing dîm a nih? A tâwp chenin a kawl dîm a nih? Ngai ta, thil ṭha naw chu i hrilin i thaw tah a, i suol thei dân tâwpin i lo suol tah,” tiin."
6,"Moreover Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.","Chu nawa khawm chun lal Josia hun lai chun ka kuomah LALPA chun a hril a, “Israel hnungtawlin a lo thaw ta hi i hmu am? Tlâng insâng tinahai hang fein le, thing hring tin hnuoia chun; chuongahai chun nawchizawr angin a lo khawsa tah a."
7,"And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.","Hieng thilhai po po hi a thaw zo hnung chun ka kuomah hung kîr i tih, ka tih a, nisienlakhawm, a hung kîr si nawh a, a zuorpuinu rilotak Juda khawm chun ama chu a hmuh a."
8,"And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot.","Israel hnungtawl chun uiretna thil a lo thaw ka hmu lei tak chun ama chu ka mâk a, inmâkna lekha ka pêk tah ti a hmu sa khawmin a zuor- puinu rilotak Juda chun ṭitna châng a hriet chuong nawh a, ama ngei khawm chu a fe a, nawchizawrah a khawsa ve tah a."
9,"And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.",A hurna inruina lei chun ram chu sukpawrchein a um tah a; thingbul- hai le lunghai le chun a lo uire tah a.
10,"And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.","Hieng thil po pohai lei khawm hin a zuorpuinu hlêm hmang Juda chu a lungril po po leh a hung kîr naw ta rawp a, a la tehlêm lem a, LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
11,"And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Juda rilotak nêk hin Israel hnung- tawl khawm hi fel lemin ân lang ie."
12,"Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not look in anger upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah, I will not keep anger for ever.","Fe la, hi thuhai hi hmâr tienga chun va phuong la, ‘Hung kîr rawh, nang Israel hnungtawl, LALPA chun a tih; i chunga chun lunginsenin en naw ning cheh a, zângai theitak ka ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih, lunginsenna chu kumkhuoin kawl zing naw ning."
13,"Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith Jehovah.","I suolna chu hre phawt phawt la, LALPA i Pathien chunga chun i lo bawsiet tah a, thing hring tin hnuoia chun hmêlmakhai kuomah i lo inphal tah a, ka râwl khawm chu i awi bawk ta nawh a, LALPA chun a tih."
14,"Return, O backsliding children, saith Jehovah; for I am a husband unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.","Hung kîr ro, hnungtawl thlahai, LALPA chun a tih; in pasal ka ni sih a, chun, khawpuia pakhat le, pa- hnama pahni lâng ka ti cheu a, Ziona chun hung ṭhuoi ka ti cheu;"
15,"And I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.","chuongchun, ka lungril ang takin berâmpu ding pêng ka ti cheu a, ama chun hrietna le hrietthiemnain châwm a ti cheu."
16,"And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith Jehovah, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.","Chun, chu rama chun in hung pung a, in hung tam pha chun; chuong niahai chun, LALPA chun a tih, “LALPA thuthlungna bâwm hi,” ti ta ngai naw ni hai. An lungrilah hung lût ta naw nih a, anni hlaka hre zing ta naw ni hai a; va sir bawk naw ni hai a, thawa thaw khawm um ta naw ni,’ ti ta ngai naw ni hai."
17,"At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.","Chu pha chun Jerusalem chu LALPA lalṭhungpha tiin inbûk an ta, hnam po pohai chu chutaka chun kei khâwm nîng an ta, LALPA hmingin Jerusalema chun, an lungril rilo ngarna ang chun fe khâwm nâwk ta ngai naw ni hai."
18,"In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance unto your fathers.","Chuong nihaia chun Juda sûng- kuo chu Israel sûngkuo le chun in- tlawn an ta, hmâr tieng rama in- thawk chun hung suok hmunkhat an ta, in thlatuhai kuoma rochan dinga ka pêk rama chun hung an tih."
19,"But I said, How I will put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! and I said, Ye shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.","“Kei chun, ‘hnamhai laia chun sie cheuin, ram inhawitak chu pe cheuin, hnamhai sipai pâwlhai rochan ṭhataka chun sie cheu ka lo lungril hlak a; chun, nangin, Pa, mi hung tîng i ta, i mi zuinaa inthawk hin fe hmang ta naw ti ni’ ka lo ti hlak a."
20,"Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah.","Anachu, nuhmeiin a pasal chu khawhlotaka a ṭhe angin, chuong ang tak chun ka chungah khawhlotakin i lo thaw ta tlat el a; Aw Israel sûng- kuo,” LALPA chun a tih."
21,"A voice is heard upon the bare heights, the weeping and the supplications of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Jehovah their God.","Bâwlhmun tlângahai chun râwl hriet a na; Israel thlahai ṭapna le hnina chu; chu chu lei chun an lampui chu an lo sukhran tah a, LALPA an Pathien chu an theinghil tah a nih."
22,"Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we are come unto thee; for thou art Jehovah our God.","“Hnungtawl thlahai, hung kîr ro; in hnungtawlnahai chu lo suk- dampêk ka ti cheu.” “Ngai ta, i kuoma chun kan hung ie, nang chu LALPA kan Pathien chu i ni sih a."
23,"Truly in vain is the help that is looked for from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.",Indiktakin muolhaia ṭhang- puina beiseia umhai chu mipui inri mur murhai chu a thlâwn el a nih; indiktakin LALPA ei Pathiena chun Israelhai sandamna chu a um a nih.”
24,"But the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.","Nisienlakhawm, ei naupang laia inthawkin, ei thlatuhai sin inrimna chu thil inzâpui umhai chun a lo fâk zo tah a, an bâwng ruolhai, an berâm ruolhai, an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai leh;"
25,"Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.","ei inzaknaa chun zâl ei ta, ei lungril ngaibuoina chun mîn khum raw se; LALPA ei Pathien chunga chun thil ei lo suksuol ta sih a; ei naupang laia inthawk tah vawisûn chen hin eini ni leh, ei thlatuhai ni leh; chuongchun, LALPA ei Pathien râwl chu ei lo awi ta naw a nih."
