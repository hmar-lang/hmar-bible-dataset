1,"And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spake unto all the people, saying,","Chun, Mattan naupa Sephatia le, Pas-hur naupa Gedalia le, Selemia naupa Jukal le, Malkija naupa Pas-hur chun mipuihai po po kuoma Jeremiain hienga a hril hi an lo hriet a,"
2,"Thus saith Jehovah, He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, and he shall live.","“Lalpa chun hieng hin a tih: Khawpui sûnga umhai chu kâwl- hnâm le ṭâm le, hripuiin thîng an ta; Kaldaihai kuoma va fe chu hring an tih; a hringna chu insanhim a ta, hring a tih,"
3,"Thus saith Jehovah, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Hi khawpui hi Babulon lal sipaihai kuta pêk ngei ding a na, ama chun lâng a tih,” tiin."
4,"Then the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.","Chun, rorêltuhai chun lal kuoma chun, “Kan hni che hi, hi mipa hi sukhlum ni ngei raw se; chuong thuhai chu an kuoma hrilin, mipui po pohai kuthai, hi khawpuia indomi umhai kuthai chu a sukzuoi a nih; hi mipa hin hi hnam ṭhatna ding hi a zawng nawh a, sietna ding a zawng lem a nih”, an ta."
5,"And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do anything against you.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun, “Ngai ta u, in kuta um a nih annâwm,; lal chu nangni kal zâwnga thil thaw thei mi ding a ni si nawh a,” a ta."
6,"Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.","Chuongchun, Jeremia chu an man a, lal naupa Malkija khurthim, vêngtuhai kul sûnga uma chun an sie lût tah a; chuongchun, Jeremia chu khuopnahai le chun an infe thlâktir tah a. Chun, chu khurthim sûnga chun chirhak ti chau naw chu tui khawm a um nawh a, chuongchun, Jeremia chu chirhaka chun ân chie tah a."
7,"Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),","Chun, Ethiopia mi, Ebed-melek, mi tillâk, lal ina um chun Jeremia chu khurthim sûnga chun an sie ti a hriet chun chu lai chun lal chu Benjamin dai kawtkhâra khan a ṭhung a."
8,"Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,","Ebed-melek chu lal ina inthawk chun a suok a, lal kuoma chun thu a hang hril tah a:"
9,"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.","“Ka lalpa, lal, hieng mihai hin zâwlnei Jeremia chunga an thil- thawhai po poa hin thil ṭha naw an thaw a nih, ama chu khurthima chun an peilût a; chutaka chun ama chu phîngṭâma thi el âwm a nih; khawpui sûnga hin bei dang hrim a um ta naw leiin,” a ta."
10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.","Chun, lal chun Ethiopia mi Ebed-melek chu thu a pêk a, “Hitaka inthawkin mi pathum ṭhuoi la, zâwl- nei Jeremia chu a thi hmain khur- thima inthawk chu va la suok ro,” a ta."
11,"So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.","Chuongchun, Ebed-melek chun mihai chu a ṭhuoi a, lal ina ro ina chun a va feh a, chutaka inthawk chun sahmul puon ṭawphai le, savun puon hluihai chu a lâk a, hruiin Jeremia kuomah khurthim a chun ân khaithlâktir tah a."
12,"And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.","Chun, Ethiopia mi Ebed-melek chun Jeremia kuoma chun, “Tuhin hieng sahmul puon ṭawphai le, savun puon hluihai hi i zakhnuoiah hrui- hruolahai hnuoia khan sil rawh,” a ta. Jeremia chun chuong ang tak chun a thawh a."
13,"So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.","Chuongchun, Jeremia chu hrui- hruol chun an khai a, khurthima inthawk chun an lâk suok tah a; chun, Jeremia chu vêngtuhai kul- bînga chun a um zing a."
14,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun mi a tir a, LALPA ina um lûtna pathumnaa khan a kuomah zâwlnei Jeremia chu a ṭhuoi tah a; chun, lal chun Jeremia kuoma chun, “Thil pakhat indawn ka ti cheh a, ka kuomah iengkhawm ip naw rawh,” a ta."
15,"Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.","Jeremia chun Zedekia kuoma chun, “Ka hrilfie chun i mi that ngei naw ding am a nih? thurâwn pe lang che khawm nang chun mi ngai bawk naw ti ni,” a ta."
16,"So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.","Chuongchun, lal Zedekia chun inrûkin Jeremia kuoma chun ân tiemkam tah a, “LALPA ei hring- nahai siemtu chu a hring zing angin, sukhlum naw ning cheh a, hieng i hringna zawngtuhai kuoma hin pe bawk naw ning che,” a ta."
17,"Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.","Chun, Jeremia chun Zedekia kuoma chun, “Sipaihai Pathien, Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih; Babulon lal rorêltuhai kuomah în pêk chun, i hringna chu hlain um a ta, hi khawpui khawm hi meiin kâng naw ni; nang chu hring i ta, i sûnghai leh;"
18,"But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.","amiruokchu, Babulon lal rorêl- tuhai kuomah în pêk naw chun hi khawpui hi Kaldaihai kuta chun pêk nîng a ta, meiin râwng an ta, an kuta inthawk chun nang khawm suok- thleng naw ti ni,” a ta."
19,"And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun, Jeremia kuoma chun “Juda mihai Kaldaihai tienga va kawp tahai kha ka ṭi a nih; an kuta khan mi pe hlau an ta, mi nuisan rawi an tih,” a ta."
20,"But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.","Nisienlakhawm, Jeremia chun, “Nang chu pe suok naw ni hai che. LALPA râwl i kuoma thu ka hrilna hi awi el rawh, ka ngên che hi, chuong- chun, i ta dingin ṭhâng a ta, i hringna khawm hlain um a tih."
21,"But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me:","Amiruokchu, vân pêk chu i nuom naw chun, hi hi a nih LALPAIN thu a mîn entir chu."
22,"Behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: now that thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.","Ngai ta, Juda ram lal ina nu- hmei mâksana umhai po po kha Babulon lal rorêltuhai kuoma hung ṭhuoi suok nîng an ta; chuong nuhmeihai chun, ‘I ruol hmêlhriet- takhai chun an hlêm cheh a, an hne ta che a ni hi; tuhin i kehai chu chirhaka chun a tluma, an hnungkîr nâwk a ni ta hi,’ tîng an ta."
23,"And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.","Chun, i nauhai le i nuhmeihai po po chu Kaldaihai kuoma chun hung la suok an ta, nang khawm an kuta inthawk chun suokthleng naw ti ni: amiruokchu, Babulona lal kuta man nîng i ta; hi khawpui hi meia raw dingin siem i tih,” a ta."
24,"Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.","Chun, Zedekia chun Jeremia kuomah, “Hieng thuhai hi tukhawm inhriettir naw la, thi naw ti ni."
25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:","Nisienlakhawm, rorêltuhai chun kân biekpui che ti an hrieta, i kuomah an hunga, i kuomah, ‘Lal kuoma i thu hril kha mi hrilfie rawh, kan kuomah ip naw la, sukhlum naw ning ung che; chun, ieng am lal chun i kuomah a hril a an ti chun,’"
26,"then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.","an kuoma chun, ‘Jonathan ina thi el dinga min kîrtir nâwk lo dingin, lal chu ka hnina ka pêk a nih’, tîng i ta,” tiin."
27,"Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.","Chuongchun, rorêltuhai po po chu Jeremia kuoma chun an hung a, an indwn ta ngei a, ama chun lalin thu a pêk ang tak pei chun a hril tah a. Chuongchun, ama le inbiek chu an mah a, a thu tak chu hril a ni si nawh a."
28,So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken,"Chuongchun, Jeremia chu vêng- tuhai kulbînga chun Jerusalem chu lâka a um ni chen chun a um tah a."
