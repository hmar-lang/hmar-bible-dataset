1,"And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.","Chun, Jehoiakim naupa Konia aia Babulon lal Nebukadnez- zarin Juda ram lala a lo siem Josia naupa Zedekia chun ro a rêl tah a."
2,"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of Jehovah, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.","Nisienlakhawm, amain amanih, a siehlawhaiin amanih, chu rama mipuihai chun amani khawm, zâwl- nei Jeremia hmanga a hril LALPA thuhai chu an ngai nawh a."
3,"And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun Selemaia naupa Jehukal le, thiempu Maaseia naupa Zephania chu zâwlnei Jeremia kuomah, “Tuhin keini ta dingin, LALPA kan Pathien kuoma chun ṭawngṭai rawh”, ti dingin a tir tah a."
4,Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.,"Chuonglai chun Jeremia chu lung ina an sie ta naw leiin, mipuihai lai chun a lûtin a suok hlak a."
5,"And Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that were besieging Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they brake up from Jerusalem.","Aigupta rama inthawk chun Pharao sipaihai chu an hung a; chun, Jerusalem inhuoltu Kaldaihai chun anni chanchin chu an lo hriet phing chun, Jerusalema inthawk chun an indar tah a."
6,"Then came the word of Jehovah unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,","Chuongchun, LALPA thu chu zâwlnei Jeremia kuoma chun a hung tlung a;"
7,"Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.","“LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Ka kuoma thu indawn dinga nang ka kuoma tirtu che, Juda ram lal kuoma chun hieng hin hril rawh: Ngai ta, Pharao sipaihai nang- ma ṭhangpui dinga hunghai chu, an ramah Aiguptaa bawk chun kîr nâwk an tih."
8,"And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.","Chuongchun, Kaldaihai hung nâwk an ta, hi khawpui hi hung do an ta, lâng an ta, meiin râwng an tih."
9,"Thus saith Jehovah, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ‘Kaldaihai chun mi mâksan ta ngei an tih,’ tiin nang le nang inhlêm naw rawh; an fe hmang âwm si nawh a."
10,"For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.","Nangma hung dotu che Kaldai sipaihai po po khawm chu lo that ta la khawm, anni laia chun mi hliemhai chau chu la umin, chuong khawm chun, mi tin chu mâni puon inhaia chun tho an ta, hi khawpui hi meiin râwng an tih,” tiin."
11,"And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,","Chun, Pharao sipaihai ṭi leia Kaldai sipaihai chu Jerusalema in- thawka an indar hnung chun,"
12,"then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.","Jeremia chu Benjamin ramah va fea, chu hnam laia a chanvo chu la dingin, Jerusalema inthawk chun a suok tah a."
13,"And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou art falling away to the Chaldeans.","Ama chu Benjamin dai kawt- khâra a um lai chun, vêngtu sipai hotu chutaka chun a lo um a, a hming chu Hanania naupa Selemia naupa Irija a nih; ama chun, “Kaldaihai kuomah în pe a nih,” tiin zâwlnei Jeremia chu a man tah a."
14,"Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.","Jeremia chun, “Thukhêl a nih; Kaldaihai kuomah kân pêk nawh,” a ta; nisienlakhawm, ama chun a ngai nawh a; chuongchun, Irija chun Jeremia chu a man a, rorêltuhai kuoma chun a hung ṭhuoi tah a."
15,"And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.","Chun, rorêltuhai chu Jeremia chunga chun an lunginsen a, ama chu an hrem a, lekhaziektu Jonathan ina chun lung inah an khum tah a; chu chu lung inah an siem ta sih a."
16,"When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;","Jeremia chu khur thima le kul- bîngahai chun a hung chun, chutaka chun Jeremia chu ni tamtak a um a;"
17,"then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.","chun, lal Zedekia chun mi a tir a, a hung ṭhuoi a, a ina chun lal chun a rûkin ân dawn a, a kuomah, “LAL- PA kuoma inthawkin thu a um?” a tih a. Chun, Jeremia chun “A um”, a tih a. “Babulon lal kutah pêkin i um ding a nih,” a ti bawk a."
18,"Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?","Chu nawa khawm lal Zedekia kuomah Jeremia chun, “Nanga chunga amanih, i siehlawhai chunga amanih, hi hnam chunga hin amanih khaw lai am ka suksuola lung ina i mi khum a na?"
19,"Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?","I zâwlneihai, ‘Babulon lal chun hi ram amanih, nang amani khawm hung do naw ni,’ tituhai kha khaw lai am an um a?"
20,"And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.","Chun, tuhin lo hre ta, aw ka pu lal, ka hni che, ka hnina hi, ka ngên che, i hmaa hin pawm ni raw se: lekhaziektu Jonathan ina khan mîn kîr tir nâwk ta naw rawh, chuong naw chun thi rawi ka tih,” a ta."
21,"Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.","Chun, lal Zedekia chun thu a pêk a; Jeremia chu vêngtuhai kula chun an sieh a, khawpui sûnga bei po po chu hmang vawng a ni chenin bei siemtuhai kawtthlêra inthawkin ni tin bei an pêk a. Chuongchun, Jere- mia chu vêngtuhai kula chun a um zing tah a."
