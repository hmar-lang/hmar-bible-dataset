1,"Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?","Aw LALPA, nang chu ka hung ngên lai che chun, i fel a, nangma le chun a san chu ei ngaituo tlâng a, mi rilo lampui chu ieng dinga a hlawtling hlak a, khawhlotaka thawtuhai po po chu nuomsaa um am an na?"
2,"Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart.","Nang chun anni chu i phun tah a, anih, zung khawm an kei a; an hung inṭhang a, ra khawm an hung ra tah a; an baua chun nang chu i hla naw hleh a, an sûnga ruok chu i hla a nih."
3,"But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.","Nisienlakhawm, aw LALPA, nang chun i mi hriet a, i mi hmuh a, nanga tienga chun ka lungril chu i fieh a, sathattu ta dinga berâmhai ang chun kei suok la, thatna ding nia ang chun anni chu buotsai rawh."
4,"How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.","Ieng chen am ram chun sûnin, ram pumpui hlohnahai chu a vuoi ding a na? chutaka an rîtlona um zing lei chun, ramsahai le vatehai khawm chu an bohmang a, “Ei ni hnungtieng tâwpna chu hmu naw ni,” an ti leiin."
5,"If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan?","Kea lâwn mihai leh in tlân a, an suksâwl hle che chun, sakawrhai le chun iengtin am inel thei i ta? Muong- na rama hman i tlu chun, Jordan ramngawa chun iengtin am thâwng i ta?"
6,"For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.","I unauhai le i pa sûngkuo ngei chun, i chungah khawhlotakin an lo thaw tah a; i hnunga chun an hung khêk rak rak a; anni chu ring naw rawh, i kuoma chun thu ṭhatakhai hril hai sien khawm."
7,"I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.","Ka in chu ka mâksan tah a, ka rohluona khawm chu ka pei thlâk a, ka thlain a hmangai dittak chu a hmêlmahai kuomah ka pêk tah a."
8,My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.,"Ka rochan khawm chu ka ta ding chun ramhnuoia sakeibaknei ang a lo ni tah a; ka chunga chun a râwl chu a mîn suo khum a; chuleiin, ama chu ka theida a nih."
9,"Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.","Ka rochan chu ka ta ding chun vate ṭiel sa fa mi ang a ni a ni ta maw? A sîr vêl tina chun vate sa fa mihai chu an um a ni maw? Nang va fe la, ramhnuoia ramsahai po po chu kei khâwm la, fa zo dingin hung ṭhuoi rawh."
10,"Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.","Berâmpu tamtakhai chun ka grêp huon chu an suksiet a, ka chan chu an ke hnuoiah an sirde a, ka chan inhawitak chu thlalêr ram râusanah an siem tah a."
11,"They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.",Râusanah an siem tah a; râu- sana umin ka kuoma chun a ṭap a; mi tukhawma lungril a an sie naw leiin ram pumpui chu râusana siem a ni tah a.
12,Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.,"Thlalêra bâwlhmun tlângahai po po chun suksetuhai chu an hung a, ram pakhat tâwpa inthawka ram dang tâwp chen chun LALPA kâwl- hnâm chun a fâk zo a, tisa hrimin muongna an nei nawh."
13,"They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.","Bu an chîng a, hling an sîk a; anni chu an insukna a, nisienla- khawm, iengkhawm a hlawk nawh, LALPA lunginsenna ṭiumtak lei chun i rahai chu inzapui i tih."
14,"Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.","Ka tuolbâwm rilohai po po, ka mi Israelhai hluo dinga ka ti lo tâwk- setu chunga chun LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, an rama inthawk chun anni chu hmalthlâng ka ta, anni laia inthawk chun Juda sûngkuo chu hmalthlâng ka tih."
15,"And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.","Anni ka hmalthlâk hnunga chun hung kîr nâwk ka ta, an chung- ah lunginsietna nei ka tih; chun, mi tin chu mâni rochan senga chun hung ṭhuoi nâwk ka ta, mi tin chu mâni ram senga chun."
16,"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.","Chun, Baal kuoma ṭawng in- khâm dinga ka mihai an inchûktir anga, “LALPA chu a hring zing angin,” tia, ka hminga ṭawng inkhâm dinga, ka mihai lampuihai chu taima- taka an inchûk chun, ka mihai laia chun anni khawm chu siempuitling nîng an tih."
17,"But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, an ngai naw chun, chu hnam chu hmalthlâng ka ta, hmalthlain suksieng ka tih, LALPA chun a tih."
