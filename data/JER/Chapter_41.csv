1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.","Chun, thla sarinaa chun lal chi Elisama naupa Nethania, chu naupa Ismael le, lal hotu lientak pakhat le, ama kuoma mi sâwmhai le chun, Mizpaa chun Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuoma chun an hung tah a; chutaka Mizpaa chun bei dâm an fâk hmunkhat tâwl a."
2,"Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.","Chun, Nethania naupa Ismael le a kuoma mi sâwm umhai chu an tho a, Saphan naupa, Ahikam naupa Gedalia, Babulon lalin chu rama rorêltu dinga a sie chu kâwlhnâm leh an thawh a, ama chu an that tah a."
3,"Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, to wit, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war.","Ismael chun Gedalia kuoma Juda umhai po po Mizpaa umhai le, Kaldai mi, chutaka um, indo mihai khawm chu a that vawng a."
4,"And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,","Chun, Gedalia chu a thata mi tukhawma an hriet naw ni hnina hnunga chun hieng hi a hung na;"
5,"that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.","Mi ṭhenkhat Sekema inthawk dâm, Siloa inthawk dâm, Samaria inthawk dâmin mi sâwmriet zet, an khâkhmul vawa, an puonhai kei- thlêra, anni le anni chu inât a, an kuta bu thilinhlânhai le rimin- hnikhai chawiin, LALPA ina hung inhlân dingin an hung tah a."
6,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.","Chun, Nethania naupa Ismael chu Mizpaa inthawk chun, a fe malama ṭap pei pumin anni chu tuok dingin a fe suok tah a; chun, anni chu ân tuokpui chun an kuoma chun, “Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuomah hung ro,” a tih a."
7,"And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.","Chun, chuong ang tak chun a hung na, khawpui sûnga an hung phing chun Nethania naupa Ismael chun anni chu a that tah a, ama le a kuoma mi umhai chun anni chu khur sûnga chun an pei thlâk tah a."
8,"But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.","Chun, anni laia chun mi sâwm Ismael kuoma, “Keini chu mi that naw rawh; rama chun bu dâm, buṭei dâm, hriek dâm, khuoizu dâm thup- hmangna khur chu kan nei sih a,” tituhai chu an um a. Chuongchun, anni chu a hla tah a, an unauhai laia chun a that ve ta nawh a."
9,"Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.","Chun, chu khur, Ismaelin Geda- lia sîra mi a thathai ruong po po a pei thlâkna chu (chu chu Israel lal Baasa a ṭi leia lal Asain a lo siem kha a nih) Nethania naupa Ismael chun chu chu mi thathai chun a suksip tah a."
10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.","Chun, Ismael chun Mizpaa mi la chuonghai po po, lal naunuhmeihai le, Ahikam naupa Gedalia kuoma Nebuzaradanin ân kawltir Mizpaa la umhai po po chu salah a ṭhuoi hmang tah a; Nethania naupa Ismael chun anni chu salah a ṭhuoi a, Ammon thlahai chu fethlengpui dingin a fe suok tah a."
11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,","Nisienlakhawm, Karea naupa Johanan le, ama kuoma um sipai hotuhai po po chun Nethania naupa Ismaelin thil ṭha naw a thawhai po po chu an lo hriet chun,"
12,"then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.","mi po po chu an ṭhuoi a, Nethania naupa Ismael chu do dingin an fe suok tah a; ama chu Gibeona tuipuihai kâwla chun an va hmuh a."
13,"Now it came to pass that, when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.","Chun, Ismael kuoma mipui um po pohai chun Karea naupa Johanan le sipai hotuhai po po le a kuoma umhai po po chu an hmu chun an lâwm ta êm êm el a."
14,"So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.","Chuongchun, Mizpaa inthawka Ismael sal intâng dinga a ṭhuoihai po po chu an inlêt a, an hung kîr a, Karea naupa Johanan kuoma chun an fe tâwl tah a."
15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.","Amiruokchu, Nethania naupa Ismael chu mi pariet leh Johanana inthawk chun a suokthleng a, Am- mon thlahai kuoma chun a fe tah a."
16,"Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to wit, the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.","Chun, Karea naupa Johanan le, a kuoma sipai hotu umhai po po chun, Nethania naupa Ismaela inthawka mipui la um sun an lâk dawkhai po po chu, Ahikam naupa Gedalia le, indo mihai, nuhmeihai, naupanghai le, mitillâkhai, Gibeona inthawka a hung ṭhuoi nâwkhai a that hnunga, a lâk suokhai chu Mizpaa inthawk chun an ṭhuoi tah a."
17,"And they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,","Chuongchun, an feh a, Kaldai- hai leia Aiguptaa lût dinga fe dingin Bethlehem kâwla Geruth-kimhama chun an chêng tah a;"
18,"because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.",Ahikam naupa Gedalia Babulon lalin chu ram chunga rorêltu dinga a sie kha Nethania naupa Ismael khan a that leiin anni chu an ṭi êm êm a.
