1,"Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in Leb-kamai, a destroying wind.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: “Ngai ta u, Babulon chunga le, Kaldaia chêngtuhai chunga chun suksietna thli hung inhrângtir ka ta."
2,"And I will send unto Babylon strangers, that shall winnow her; and they shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.","Chun, Babulona chun ama zâptu ding tir ka ta, ama ram chu zâpfai an tih; buoina niahai chun a vêlin ama kaltuhai ruok an ni ding a ni sih a."
3,"Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his coat of mail: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.","Thalkâptu chun a thalngul chu kuoi naw raw se, ama chu a îndona thuom chun inthuom bawk naw raw se, a tlangvâlhai chu hla naw unla, a sipaihai po po chu sukse fai rêt ro."
4,"And they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.","Kaldai rama chun thata umin tlûng an ta, an kawtthlêrhaia chun sunthlengin um an tih."
5,"For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Jehovah of hosts; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.","Israelhai amanih, Judahai ama- nih, an Pathien, sipaihai LALPA chu a nghatsan si nawh a; an ram chu Israel Mi Inthieng dodâlin khawhlo- nain sip hle sien khawm."
6,"Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; be not cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of Jehovah’s vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense.","Babulona inthawk chun tlân suok unla, mi tinin a hringna sandam raw se; a khawhlonaa sât thlâkin um naw unla, LALPA phuba lâkna hun a ni sih a; ama chun thungna chu pêng a tih;"
7,"Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah’s hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.","Babulon chu LALPA kuta chun rângkachak no hnuoi po po sukruitu chu a lo ni tah; hnamhai chun a uoin chu an dâwn tah a; chuleiin, hnamhai chu an invêt a nih."
8,"Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.","Babulon chu a tlu thut a, suksietin a um a; ama ta dingin ṭap inrûm unla; a natna ta dingin thinghnai damdawi la unla, chuong- chun, a hung dam khiet rawi mawh."
9,"We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.","Babulon chu sukdam ka tum a, nisienlakhawm, sukdamin a um si nawh a; ama chu mâksan unla, mi tin chu mâni ram sengah fêng ei tiu; a chungthu rêlna chun vân a tlung ta sih a; vânhai chena dawm sâng chu a ni ta sih a."
10,"Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.","LALPA chun ei felnahai chu a hung lâk suok a; hung unla, Ziona chun va hril dar ei tiu, ei Pathien LALPA sinthawhai hi."
11,"Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: Jehovah hath stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it: for it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.","Thalhai chu tâtngei unla, phawhai chu chel det ro; LALPA chun Media lalhai lungril chu a hung chawktho ta sih a; a remruot chu Babulon do le suksiet chu a na, LALPA phuba lâkna, a biekin phuba lâkna chu a ni sih a."
12,"Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Jehovah hath both purposed and done that which he spake concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.","Babulon kul banghai epa chun puonzâr chu khai unla, râlvêng chu sukhrât unla, vêngtuhai sie unla, râlvêng chu buotsai bawk ro; Babulon hluotuhai chunga chun LALPA chun a thurawt le a hril chu a thaw a ni ta hi."
13,"O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy covetousness.","Aw nang tui tamtakhai chunga chêng, hausaknaa bit, i tâwpna a hung tlung mêk a, i hringna hrui ân tan tah."
14,"Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with the canker-worm; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.","Sipaihai LALPA chun, ‘Mathei- loin, leiṭha ang elin, mihriemin hung suksip ngei ngei ka ti cheh a, chun, i chunga chun hung khêk khum an ti che,’ tiin ama le ama insâlin a lo inkhâm tah a."
15,"He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens.","“A thilthawtheinân hnuoi chu a siem a, a varnain khawvêl chu a tungding a, a hrietthiemna chun vân- hai khi a keiphar bawk a;"
16,"When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.","a râwl a hung insuo pha chun, vânhaia tuihai ân ri hum hum a; leihnuoi tâwphaia inthawk chun tui- hu dâm chu ân zâmkaitir bawk a, ruo ta dingin kâwlinlephai chu a siem a, a robâwmhaia inthawk chun thlihai chu a hung lâk suok a."
17,"Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.","Mi tin el chu an lo intlaw tah a; hrietna boin an lo um tah a, rângkachak suttu tinhai khawm chu an milim kera siemhai lei chun sukzakin an um tah a, an milim sunghai chu khêlhlip el a ni sih a, annia chun inthuokna khawm a um si nawh a."
18,"They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.","Teplo el an nih, thil suol sin- thaw, anni chu hrem an ni pha chun bohmang an tih."
19,The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.,"Jakob chan chu hieng ang hi chu a ni nawh; ama chu thil po poa hmasa a na, Israel khawm chu a rochana a chipui a nih; Sipaihai LALPA chu a hming a nih."
20,Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war: and with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;,"“Nang chu ka indona hrei le, ka hriemhrei i nih; nangma chu hmang- in hnamhai chu suknawi vawng ka tih; nangma chu hmangin lalramhai chu suksieng ka ta;"
21,and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;,nangma chu hmangin sakawr le a chunga chuong khawm chu suknawi vawng ka tih;
22,and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and him that rideth therein; and with thee will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces the old man and the youth; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the virgin;,"chun, nangma chu hmangin sakawr tawlailîr le a chunga chuong khawm suknawi vawng ka ta, nang- ma hmangin nuhmei khawm pasal khawm suknawi bawk ka tih; nang- ma hmangin upa le naupang khawm suknawi vawng ka ta; nangma hmangin tlangvâl le nunghâk khawm suknawi vawng ka tih;"
23,and with thee will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces governors and deputies.,"nangma hmangin berâmpuhai le a ran ruol suknawi vawng ka ta, nangma hmangin lo neitu le a bâwngchal tuokhai khawm suknawi vawng ka tih; chun, nangma hmangin ram awptuhai lal aiawtuhai chu suknawi vawng ka tih."
24,"And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith Jehovah.","Chun, Babulon kuoma le, Kaldai hluotuhai po po chunga chun i mithmua Ziona thil ṭha naw an lo thaw tahai po po kha thung ka tih, LALPA chun a tih."
25,"Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith Jehovah, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.","“Ngai ta, Aw suksetu tlâng, hnuoi po po suksetu, nang ka dodâl che a nih, LALPA chun a tih: i chunga chun ka kut hung inlet ka ta, râwl- khotlânga inthawk chun inhlum thlâng ka ti cheh a, tlâng kângah siem ka ti che."
26,"And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith Jehovah.","Chun, a kia lung dingin ama- nih, lungphûm dingin amanih nang- maa inthawk chun la naw ni hai a; amiruokchu, kumkhuoa râusan ni lem i tih, LALPA chun a tih."
27,"Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker-worm.","Rama chun indo puonzâr chu khai unla, hnamhai laia chun taw- tawrâwt mût unla, hnamhai chu ama do dingin buotsai ro; ama chunga chun Ararat dâm, Minni dâm, Askenaz lalramhai chu ko khâwm unla, a chunga chun sipai hotu lien inruot unla, sakawrhai chu khâu hawn angin inhungtir ro."
28,"Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, the governors thereof, and all the deputies thereof, and all the land of their dominion.","Ama chunga chun, hnamhai, Media lalhai, an ram awptuhai, an lal aiawtuhai po po, a huop sûng ram po pohai chu buotsai ro."
29,"And the land trembleth and is in pain; for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.","Ram chu ân thin a, a nah a; Babulon chunga LALPA thiltum, Babulon ram chu hluotu um loa râusana um dinga a tum chu a la um zing sih a."
30,"The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might hath failed; they are become as women: her dwelling-places are set on fire; her bars are broken.","Babulon mi thilthawtheihai chun indo chu an ṭhul a, an kulahai chun an um zing a; an thilthawtheina khawm a thlâwn a, nuhmeihai ang el an ni tah a; a chêngna hmunhai chu meia rawin a um a, ân huonna thîr- hai khawm chu sukthliekin a um tah a."
31,"One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:","Thangko pakhat chu a dang intuokpui dingin tlân a ta, mi tir pakhat chu a dang intuokpui dingin tlân bawk a ta, Babulon lal chu kil tina inthawkin khawpui chu lâk a ni tah ti hril dingin;"
32,"and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.","fenahai chu khârin a um a, phairuonghai chu meiin an rawh a, indo mihai khawm chu suklâuin an um tah a,” tiin."
33,"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.","Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a ti sih a: “Babulon naunu chu hrizâwl bu chîl mêkna lai ang chu a nih; nakie sâwt nawtêah, ama ta dingin bu chil hun la hung tlung a tih,” tiin."
34,"Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath, like a monster, swallowed me up, he hath filled his maw with my delicacies; he hath cast me out.","“Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chun a mi fâk zo a, a mi suknawi a, ama chun bêl ruokah a mi siem tah a, rûlpui ang elin a mi lem a, kân hnikna chun a phîng chu a suksip a, a mi peisâk tah a."
35,"The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.","Ka chunga le ka tisa chunga thawluina hi Babulon chungah um raw se,” Zion hluotuhai chun, tîng an ta; “Ka thisen hi Kaldai hluotuhai chungah um raw se,” Jerusalem chun ti bawk a tih."
36,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: “Ngai ta u, in thua chun ṭan ka ti cheu a, in ta dingin phuba lapêk ka ti cheu; chun, a tuisuoriet chu sukkang ka ta, a tuikhur khawm chu sukhul ka tih."
37,"And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.","Babulon chu hmun dêng pâwng el, sihalhai ta dinga chêngna hmun ding le, maktia um ding le, hluotu um loa inchek khum el ding nîng a tih."
38,They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions’ whelps.,"Sakeibaknei vânglaihai angin a ruolin inrûm an ta, sakeibaknei têhai angin innghir an tih."
39,"When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith Jehovah.","Suklum an ni pha chun, an ta dingin ruoi ṭhêng ka ta, anni chu sukrui ka ta, chuongchun, an hlim a, tho nâwk ta lo dinga kumkhuoa innaa chun an in theina dingin, LALPA chun a tih."
40,"I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.","Sa thattu kuoma berâmtehai ang le, kêlchalhai le berâmchalhai angin anni chu hung lâng ka tih."
41,How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!,"Sesak chu iengtiziea lâka um el, hnuoi pumpuiin an inpâkna chu maktia um el chu! Hnamhai laia chun iengtiziea Babulon chu râusana um el!"
42,The sea is come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.,"Babulon chunga chun tuisuo- riet chu a hung luong a, tuifâwn tamtakhai chun a hung inkhum tah a."
43,"Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.","A khawpuihai chu râusan, ram ṭâwl, thlalêr ram, ram mi chêng nawna hmun, mihriem nau tukhawm sir ngai lo ram a lo ni tah a."
44,"And I will execute judgment upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.","Babulona Bêl chu hrem ka tih; a ilem tahai khawm chu a baua in- thawkin hung la suokpêk ka tih; chuongchun, hnamhai chu ama kuoma chun luong hmunkhat ta ngai naw ni hai a, anih, Babulon kulbang chu chim a tih."
45,"My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Jehovah.","“Ka mihai, a sûnga inthawk chun fesuok unla, mi tin chu LALPA lunginsenna ṭiumtaka inthawk chun insandam seng ro."
46,"And let not your heart faint, neither fear ye for the tidings that shall be heard in the land; for tidings shall come one year, and after that in another year shall come tidings, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.","In lungrilhai chu thidang naw sienla, chu rama thuthang hriet ding lei khawm chun ṭi bawk naw ro; kum khat chu thuthang chu hung a ta, chu hnunga chun kum dangah thuthang bawk chu hung a tih, thawluina le, rorêltu le rorêltu inkalna dâm."
47,"Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment upon the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.","Chuleiin, ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung mêk, Babulona milim kera siemhai chunga chun rorêl ka ta, a ram pumpui chu inzak a tih; a ithathai po po khawm chu a sûnga chun tlûng an tih."
48,"Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come unto her from the north, saith Jehovah.","Chun, vân le hnuoi le an sûnga um po pohai chu Babulon chunga lâwm lei chun hla sak an ta; hmâr- tienga inthawkin a kuoma chun suk- setu a hung ding a ni sih a; LALPA chun a tih."
49,"As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.","Babulon chun Israelin a thathai a lo intlûktir ta ang khan, ram po po thathai chu chuong ang bawk chun Babulona chun tlûng an tih."
50,"Ye that have escaped the sword, go ye, stand not still; remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.","“Nangni kâwlhnâma inthawka suokthlenghai, fe unla, ngîr ṭawk ṭawk naw ro, hlataka inthawk chun LALPA chu hre zing unla, Jerusalem chu in lungrilah in hungtir hlak ro."
51,"We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah’s house.","Kâwkna chu ei hriet tâk leiin ei inzak a, buoinahai chun ei hmaihai khawm an inkhum tah a, LALPA ina hmun inthienga chun mikhuolhai chu an hung lût ta sih a."
52,"Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will execute judgment upon her graven images; and through all her land the wounded shall groan.","Chuleiin, ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung mêk, a milim kera siem- hai chunga chun rorêlna nei ka ta, a ram sûng po poa chun hliemhai chu inrûm an tih, LALPAIN a tih."
53,"Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall destroyers come unto her, saith Jehovah.","Babulon chu vân chenin vûm sienkhawm, a hrâtna insâng khawm chu la sukhrât zuol pei sienkhawm, keia kuoma inthawkin suksetuhai an hung ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
54,"The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!","Babulona inthawka ṭap ri le, Kaldaihai rama suksietna nasatak chu e!"
55,"For Jehovah layeth Babylon waste, and destroyeth out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:","LALPA chun Babulon chu a suk- siet a, amaa inthawka râwl ropuitak chu a sukbohmang tah a; chun, an chângvêl chu tui tamtakhai angin an inrih a, an râwl rihai chu insuoin a um a;"
56,"for the destroyer is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Jehovah is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.","ama chunga chun suksetu chu a hung ta sih a, Babulon chung ngeia chun; a mi thilthawtheihai chu manin an um a, an thalngulhai khawm chu a tliek innawi vawng a; LALPA chu phuba latu Pathien a ni sih a, ama chun thung ngei ngei a tih."
57,"And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.","Chun, a lalhai le a mi varhai le, a rorêltuhai le, a lal aiawtuhai le a mi thilthawtheihai chu sukrui ka ta; kumkhuoa innaa chun in an ta, tho ta naw ni hai, Laltak, a hming khawm sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
58,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.","Babulon kulbang lientakhai khawm chu sukchim nîng an ta, a dai kawtkhârhai chu meia raw nîng an ta, a mipuihai chu a thlâwn elin inrim an ta, hnamhai khawm chu mei leiin inrim an ta, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih” tiin."
59,"The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.","A rorêl a kum li kuma, Juda lal Zedekia le Babulona an hang fe laia, Maaseia naupa Neria, chu naupa Seraia kuoma zâwlnei Jeremia thupêk thuhai chu. Tun Seraia chu khawtlâng hotu lien tak a na."
60,"And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.","Chun, Jeremia chun Babulon chunga thil ṭha naw hung tlung ding- hai po po, Babulon chungchângthua thu zieka umhai po po chu, lekhabua chun a ziek a."
61,"And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words,","Chun, Jeremia chun Seraia kuoma chun, “Babulona i va fe pha chun, hieng thuhai po po hi en la, tiem la,"
62,"and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.","‘Aw LALPA, nang chun hi hmun chungchâng thua hin, sât thlâk ding a nizie dâm, tukhawm an chêng naw dingzie dâm, mihriem amanih, ramsa amani khawm an chêng naw dingzie le, kumkhuoa râusan a ni dingzie chu i lo hril tah a,’ ti la."
63,"And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:","Chun, hi lekhabu hi i tiem zo pha pha chun, lung leh khit dêng i ta, Euphrates vadunga chun va pei lût i tih;"
64,"and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.","chun, ‘Hieng ang bawk hin Babulon chu tlumhmang a ta, a chunga thil ṭha naw ka hung in- tlungtir dinghai lei chun tho nâwk ta ngai naw nih a, rimsi hle tâng an tih,’ ti rawh,” a ta. Jeremia thuhai chu chu chen chu a nih."
