1,"Then said Jehovah unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuom- ah, “Mosie le Samuel chu ka hmaah ngîr ta hai sienla khawm, ka lungril chu hi hnam tienga hin ân hêm thei nawh; ka mithmua in- thawkin hnawt suok la, anni chu infe suoktir rawh."
2,"And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.","Chun, i kuoma chun, ‘Khawtieng am kan fe ding a na?’ an ti pha chun anni chu hi hi hril i tih: ‘LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Thina ta dinghai chu thinaah, kâwlhnâm ta dinghai chu kâwlhnâmah; ṭâmna ta dinghai chu ṭâmnaah; sala intângna ta dinghai chu salah,’ tîng i tih."
3,"And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith Jehovah: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.","Chun, an chunga tlung dingin thil chi li ruot ka ta; LALPA chun a tih: kâwlhnâm chu sukhlum dingin, uihai chu keinawitu dingin, chun, chunglêng vatehai le hnuoia ramsa- hai chu fa zotu ding le suksetu dingin."
4,"And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.","Chun, anni chu, Juda lal Hezekia naupa Manasse Jerusalema a thil- thawhai lei khan, hnuoi chunga lalram po pohai laia chun hmatieng hnungtienga hnawtlêng dingin inumtir ka tih."
5,"For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who will bemoan thee? or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare?","Aw Jerusalem, tuin am i chungah lunginsietna nei a ta? Tuin am an sûn ding che a ni leh? Annawleh, i ham- ṭhatna ding thu hni dingin tu am hnungkîr an ta?"
6,"Thou hast rejected me, saith Jehovah, thou art gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against thee, and destroyed thee; I am weary with repenting.","Nang chun i mi lo hnâwl ta a, LALPA chun a tih: hnungtieng i lo fe tah a; chuleiin, i chungah ka kut kân let a, ka suksiet che a nih; lunginsietna inlangtir hi ka nghawk ta a nih."
7,"And I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved them of children, I have destroyed my people; they returned not from their ways.",Chu ram dai kawtkhârahai chun anni chu hmaizâpin ka zâp a; an nauhai chu ka lâk hmangpêk tâwl a; ka mihai chu ka suksiet tah a; an lampuihaia inthawk chun an lamlêt chuong nawh.
8,Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.,"Tuisuorieta phaiphin nêk hman- in an hmeithaihai chu ka sukpung lem a, sûn changlai chun nuhai le tlangvâlhai chunga chun suksetu ka hung intlungtir a, amânu chunga chun ṭitnahai le lunginzîngnahai kân tlâktir thut a."
9,"She that hath borne seven languisheth; she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been put to shame and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith Jehovah.","Nau pasari neitunu chu a chau tah a, a chau let dêr a; sûn a ni lai chun a nisa chu a tla tah a; ama chu ân zakin a hamhai a; chun, anni a la mahlahai chu an hmêlmahai kuomah kâwlhnâmah pêng ka tih,” LALPA chun a tih."
10,"Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; yet every one of them doth curse me.","Nu, ka chung a va rik de! hnuoi chung po poa insêl mi le inkhing mia i mi lo nei hi chu! a pung umin kân pûktir ngai nawh a, kei khawm tu- khawma a pung umin an mîn pûktir bawk nawh; amiruokchu, an rêng elin ṭawngsie an mi lân phur ta rawp hi."
11,"Jehovah said, Verily I will strengthen thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.","LALPA chun, “Titakzetin, thil ṭhaa dingin sukdet ka ti cheh a; titak- zetin, tuor lai huna le thil ṭha naw hung tlung huna chun i hmêlmahai chun i kuoma hnina siem dingin inumtir ka tih,” a tih."

13,"Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.","I ramrihai po poa chun, i suolhai po poa ding chun, i thuomhnaw le i rohai chu man boa râllâk sum dingin pêng ka tih."
14,"And I will make them to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.","Chun, i hmêlmahai le ram i hriet ngai nawa chun infetir ka ti cheh a, ka lunginsen chun mei chu sêm a na, i chungah chawk kumkhuong a tih."
15,"O Jehovah, thou knowest; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.","Aw LALPA, nang chun i hriet a; mi hre zing la, mi hung sir la, a mi hremtuhai chu phuba hung la rawh; i teireingaitheina chun mi la hmang naw la, nangma lei chun kâwkna ka tuor a ni ti hre rawh."
16,"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.","I thuhai chu hmu suok a ni tah a; chuong chu ka fâk a; chuongchun, i thuhai chu ka lungrila hlimna le, ka ta dinga lâwmna a nih; Aw LALPA sipaihai Pathien, i hming chawia ko ka ni sih a."
17,"I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation.","Hlimna siema inkhâwmhai laia chun ka ṭhung nawh a, ka hlim bawk naw a; i kut lei chun makhât chauin ka ṭhung a; lunginzîngna nasatak chun i mi suksip ta sih a."
18,"Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook, as waters that fail?","Iengleiin am ka natna hi a re hlek nawh a, sukdam nuom dêr lo ang ela ka hliemna hi sukdam thei loa um am an nih a? Ka ta ding hin vadungte hlêmhmang, tuihai kang hlak ang chu in ni tak tak ding am a nih?"
19,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, that thou mayest stand before me; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.","Chuleichun, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: I hung kîr chun, ka hmaa i ngîr theina dingin hung ṭhuoi nâwk ka ti che; mi suolhaia inthawka thil hluhai i lâk suok chun, ka bau ang nîng i ta; anni chu i kuomah hung kîr an ta, nang ruok chu an kuom tieng kîr naw ti nih."
20,"And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.","Chun, hi hnam ta ding hin dârsen bang kulah siem ka ti cheh a; nang chu hung do hlak an ti cheh a, nisienlakhawm, hne ngai naw ni hai che; sandam ding le sansuok ding chein i kuomah ka um zing sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
21,"And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.","Mi rilohai kuta inthawk chun sansuok ka ti cheh a, thil ṭium kuta inthawk chun intlansuok bawk ka ti che."
