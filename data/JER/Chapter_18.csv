2,"Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.","“Tho la, bêl hemtu ina chun fe thla la, chutaka chun ka thu inngaitir ka ti che,” a ta."
3,"Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he was making a work on the wheels.","Chuongchun, bêlhemtu ina chun ka fe thla a, bêlhemna khâwlah a sin chu a lo thaw a."
4,"And when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.","Chun, pilpawka bêl a siem chu a him naw pha chun, bêlhemtu chun ṭha a ti ang peiin bel dangah a siem nâwk a."
5,"Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
6,"O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.","“Aw Israel sûngkuo, hi bêl hemtu ang hin i chunga hin ka thaw thei ni lo am a nih? LALPA chun a tih. Ngai ta, pilpawk chu bêl hemtu kuta a um angin, nang chu ka kuta um i nih, aw Israel sûngkuo."

8,"if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.","chu hnam, a chungthu ka hril chu an thil ṭha nawa inthawka an hung kîr chun, thil ṭha naw an chunga thaw dinga ka ngaituo chu la kir ka tih."
9,"And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;","Chun, ieng huna khawm hnam amanih, lalram chungthuah siem ding le inngîr dinga ka hril a,"
10,"if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.","ka mithmua chun thil ṭha naw a thawa, ka râwl a ngai naw chun, anni sukṭhatna dinga ka ti thil ṭha chu la kîr ka tih."
11,"Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.","Chuleiin, tuhin fe la, Jerusalem hluotuhai le Juda rama mihai kuoma chun thu hril la, ‘LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, in chungah thil ṭha naw ka riruong a, in chungah phierrûkna ka phierrûk a, tuhin mi tin mâni lampui rilo senga inthawk chun hung kîr raw se; chuongchun, in thilthawhai le in lampuihai chu siem ṭha ro,’ tiin."
12,"But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.","“Nisienlakhawm, ‘Beiseina hrim a um nawh, mi tin mâni ngairuotna ang seng ei hraw ding a na, eini mi tin chun mâni lungril rilo ngar- zie ang peiin ei thaw el ding a nih,’ an ta."
13,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ask ye now among the nations, who hath heard such things; the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.","“Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih; Hnamhai laia chun indawn unla, hieng ang thilhai hi hre hlak an um am; Israel nunghâk inthieng chun thil râpthlâktak el chu a lo thaw tah a."
14,Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? or shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?,"Lebanon vûr chun ramhnuoi lungpui chu a mâksan ding am a nih? Annawleh, tui dei ram hlataka inthawka hung luong thlahai chu a kang el ding am a nih?"
15,"For my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to false gods; and they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up;","Ka mihai chun an mi thei- nghil a, teplo kuoma chun riminhnik chu an lo raw ta sih a; chun, anni chun an lampuihaia chun an insui thlûktir a, tienlaia lampuihai, lampui rûka fe dingin, tluongpui lam niloa chun;"
16,"to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.","an ram chu makti dinga siem ding le, hahîpa siem dingin; mi tin chu fe khêl taphawt chun maktîng an ta, an lu thin an tih."
17,"I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.","Sak thli ang elin anni chu an hmêlmahai kuomah sukdar vawng ka ta, an lungngai nia chun ka hmai ni loin ka hnungtieng inentir ka tih,” tiin."
18,"Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.","Chun, anni chun, “Hung ro khai, Jeremia chunga hin thuphier- rûk phier ei tih; thiempua inthawkin dânin bo ni nei naw nih a, mi vara inthawkin thurâwn le, zâwlneia inthawka thu bo naw nih. Hung ta u, hril se bawr bawr ei ta, a thuhai chu a ieng ieng khawm chu awipêk nâwng ei tiu,” an ta."
19,"Give heed to me, O Jehovah, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.","Aw LALPA, mi hung ngaisak la, keia mi kaltuhai râwl chu lo ngai ta."
20,"Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.","Thil ṭha naw chu thil ṭhaa thung a ni ding am a nih? Ka thlarau ta dingin khur an cho ta sih a. An ta dinga thil ṭha hril dinga i hmaa, i lunginsenna annia inthawka suk- kieng dinga ka ngîr kha hre zing la."
21,"Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, and their young men smitten of the sword in battle.","Chuleiin, an thlahai chu ṭâm kuoma chun pe la, anni chu kâwl- hnâm thilthawtheina kuoma chun pe rawh; chuongchun, an nuhmeihai chu nau bo le, hmeithaihai innitir la, an pasalhai chu thinaa sukhlum ni hai sienla, chun, an tlangvâlhai chu indonaa kâwlhnâma that ni raw hai se."
22,"Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.","An chunga sipai ruol i hung ṭhuoi thut pha chun, an inhaia in- thawk chun ṭap hriet ni raw se, kei mi manna dingin khur an cho a, ka kehai ta ding chun châng an kam sih a."
23,"Yet, Jehovah, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me; forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight; but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thou with them in the time of thine anger.","Amiruokchu, LALPA, mi thatna dinga ka chunga an thu inrâwnna po po kha i hriet a, an suolna chu ngai- dam naw la, i mithmua inthawk chun an suol chu sukhmangpêk bawk naw rawh, amiruokchu, nangma hmaa chun pei thlûkin um hai sienla, anni chu i lunginsen lai chun sawisa rawh."
