1,"Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Jehovah, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.","Tûn LALPA ina hotu lientak, Immer naupa thiempu Pas- hur chun hieng thuhai hi Jeremia chun a hril ti a lo hriet a."
2,"Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Jehovah.","Pas-hur chun zâwlnei Jeremia chu a hrem a, LALPA ina Benjamin dai kawtkhâr chunghnung lema um, intângna ina chun a khum a."
3,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, Jehovah hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.","A zinga chun; Pas-hur chun Jeremia chu intângna ina inthawk chun a hung ṭhuoi suok a. Jeremia chun a kuomah, “LALPA chun i hming hi Pas-hur a ti naw cheh a, Magor-missabib a ti lem che a nih."
4,"For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Ngai ta, i ruolhai le nangma ngei ta dingin ṭiumah ka siem ding che a nih; chun, an hmêlmahai kâwlhnâma ngei chun tlûng an ta, chu chu i mit ngeiin hmûng i tih; chun, Juda ram po po chu Babulon lal kutah pêng ka ta, ama chun Babulon tieng salah ṭhuoi a ta, kâwlhnâmin anni chu that a tih."
5,"Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.","Chu nawa khawm chun, hi khaw- puia hausaknahai po po, chutaka a thil hlâwkhai po po, chutaka a thil hluhai po po, anih, Juda lalhai ro thilhai po po el chu an hmêlmahai, anni suksea, anni ṭhuoia, Babulona fepuitu dinghai kuta chun ka pêk ding a nih."
6,"And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.","Chun, nang Pas-hur le i ina chênghai po po chu sala ṭhuoiin um in ta; Babulona chun fêng i tih; chutaka chun thîng i ta, chutaka phûm chu nîng i ta, nang le i ruolhai po po an kuoma thu indik lotaka i lo hril hlakhai le chun,” tiin."
7,"O Jehovah, thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me.","Aw LALPA, nang chun i mi lo aikei tah a, ailâkin ka um tah a, nang chu keia nêkin i hrât lem a, i hne tah a, sûnnithlâk elin nuizatbûr ka na, mi tin el chun an mi nuiêu a."
8,"For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.","Thu ka hril zâtin ka khêk sih a; ka khêk a, “Thawluina le suksietna” tiin; LALPA thu chu ka ta dingin kâwkna le ni tin tinin mi hrilinsîma siem a na."
9,"And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot contain.","Chun, ama chanchin hi hril nâwng ka ta, a hmingin thu hril naw ningah, ti ding ni lang, ka ruhai sûnga mei khâr nela chawk ang elin ka lungrila hin a um a, ka topui ṭawk ṭawk thei nawh a, ka umpui thei nawh a."
10,"For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, they that watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.","Sîr tina ṭium le, mi tamtakhai hrilsietna chu ka hriet a. Ka ruol, hmêlhriettakhai, ka tlûk nghâktuhai chun, “Hril se ro, ama chu hrilsieng ei ta, ama chu ailâkin um a ta, ama chu hnêng ei ta, ama chunga chun ei phuba chu lâng ei tih,” an tih a."
11,"But Jehovah is with me as a mighty one and a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chu mi thilthawtheitak le ṭium angin ka kuoma chun a um a; chuleiin, a mi sukrinumtuhai chu insui thlûng an ta, hlawtling naw ni hai; vartaka an lo thaw ta naw leiin, anni chu kum- khuoa theinghil ta lo ding inza- puiuma chun inzak ngei an tih."
12,"But, O Jehovah of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.","Nisienlakhawm, aw sipaihai LALPA mi fel chu fieh a, lungril le lungvar hmutu, anni chunga i phu- balâk chu mîn hmutir la; nangma kuoma ngei chun ka chungthu chu ka hung târlang sih a."
13,"Sing unto Jehovah, praise ye Jehovah; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.","LALPA kuoma chun hla sak unla, LALPA chu inpâk ro; thil suol thawtuhai kuta inthawk chun mi tlasam thlarau chu a sansuok sih a."
14,Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.,Ka piengna ni chu ṭawngse- phurin um raw se: ka nuin a mi nei ni chu malsâwmin um naw raw se.
15,"Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child is born unto thee; making him very glad.","Mi ka pa kuoma, “I ta dingin naupasal a pieng ie,” tia ama sukhlim a, a kuoma thu hung intluntu chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se."
16,"And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;","Chun, chu mi LALPAIN khaw- puihai insîrna nei loa a sukchimhai ang chu ni raw se; zîngtieng chun khêkri inhriettir la, sûn huna chun ṭitrâwl inhriettir bawk la;"
17,"because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.","ama chun sula chun a mi suk- hlum ta naw leiin; chuong ni sien chu ka nu chu ka thlân lo ni tâng a ta, a sul chun mi vawn zing el ding bah."
18,"Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?","Ieng dinga sininrimna le lung- ngaina hi hmu dinga, ka nihai chu inzaknaa sukbohmanga um dinga hi sula hung suok am ka nih aw?"
