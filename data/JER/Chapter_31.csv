18,"I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art Jehovah my God.","Ephraim chu hieng ang lusûn hin ka hriet ngei a nih: “Bâwngtê rîngkawl la bât ṭhang lo angin nangin i mi thununa, thununin ka um a; nangin mîn hertir la, chuongchun, inher ka tih: nang chu LALPA ka Pathien i ni sih a,” tiin."

20,"Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.","Ephraim hi ka naupa dittak am a nih? Ama hi naupang tiawi am a nih? Ama ka thunun pha, ama chu ka hriet zing tlat el hi? Chuleiin, ka lungril chun ama ka lainat a; matheiloin, ama chunga chun zâ- ngaina nei ngei ka tih, LALPA chun a tih."

23,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.","Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: An sal intângna ka hung lâk kîr nâwk pha chun Juda rama le chutaka khawpuihaia chun hi ṭawngbau hi la hmang nâwk an tih: “Aw indikna chêngna, LALPA chun mal sâwm raw se che,” ti dâm le, “Aw inthiengna tlâng,” ti dâm hi."
24,"And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.","Chun, Juda le chutaka khaw- puihai po po chu um hmunkhat tâng an ta; loneituhai le, berâm ruol le invâk vêlhai khawm chu."
25,"For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.","Mi chauhai chu ka suktlai a, mi lungngai tinhai khawm chu ka sukhar bawk a."
26,"Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.","Hi lei hin ka tho a, ka en a, ka imu chu inhnik ka ti êm êm a."
27,"Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.","Ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung, LALPA chun a tih: Juda sûng- kuo le Israel sûngkuo chu ramsa chi le mihriem chiin tûng ka ta."
28,"And it shall come to pass that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith Jehovah.","Chun, anni chu hmalthla ding le, sukchim ding le, peithla ding le, sukse ding le, sukrinum dinga ka enkai zing ang khan, chuong ang bawk chun, anni chu bâwl ding le phun dingin enkai zing ka tih, LALPA chun a tih."
29,"In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.","Chuong niahai chun, “Thlatu- hai chu grêp thûr an fâk leiin, an thlahai hahai chu a ṭim,” ti ta ngai naw ni hai."
30,"But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.","Nisienlakhawm, mi tin chu mâni suolnaa ngei chun thîng a ta, mi tin grêp thûr fatu chu, ama hahai ngei chu ṭim a tih."
31,"Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:","Ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung, LALPA chun a tih, Juda sûng- kuo le Israel sûngkuo le chun thuthlung thar siem ka ta;"
32,"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.","Aigupta rama inthawka hung ṭhuoi suok dinga kuta anni ka chel nia an thlatuhai kuoma thuthlung ka siem ang dungzui kha ni loin, an ta dingin pasal ka ni dea chu, chu ka thuthlung chu an bawsiet a, LALPA chun a tih."
33,"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.","Amiruokchu, chuong nihai hnunga Israel sûngkuo le thuthlung ka siem ding chu hi hi nîng a tih, LALPA chun a tih: an sûngrilahai chun ka dân chu sieng ka ta, an lungrilahai chun ziek bawk ka tih; chun, an Pathien nîng ka ta, anni chu ka mihai nîng an tih,"
34,"And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.","chun, mi tinin mâni tuol- bâwmhai chu inchûktir ta naw ni hai a, mâni unauhai seng leh; “LALPA chu hre ro,” tiin inchûktir ta naw ni hai, anni a chîn taka inthawka a lien tak chenin kei an mi hriet vawng ta ding a nih, LALPA chun a tih: an bawsietnahai chu ngaidam ka ta, an suolna khawm hre zing ta naw ning."
35,"Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name:","Sûna nisa chu var dinga pea, zâna arasihai le thla var dinga ruotna petu, tuisuoriet chu chawkthoa, tuifâwnhai inrûmtirtu LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ama chu sipaihai LALPA chu a hming a na;"
36,"If these ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.","Hieng thil ruothai hi ka hmaa inthawka an lo fe hmang chun, Israel khawm chu kumkhuoa dingin ka hmaa chun hnam an ni chu bo ve bawk a tih."
37,"Thus saith Jehovah: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith Jehovah.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Chunga vân khi inkhi thei a na, hnuoia leihnuoi lungphûm chu zawng suok thei a ni chun, thil an lo thaw tahai po po lei khan Israel chi chu pei hmang vêng ka tih: LALPA chun a tih."
38,"Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner.","Ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung, LALPA chun a tih: Hananel in insânga inthawka a kia dai kawtkhâr chenin, LALPA ta dingin khawpui chu bâwl nîng a tih."
39,"And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah.","Chun, ân khina hmawl chu Gareb tlâng chenin fe tluon suok a ta, Goaa chun va kâwi a tih."
40,"And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.","Chun, mithi ruong phairuom pumpui le, vut phairuom le Kidron vadungtê chen, saktienga sakawr dai kawtkhâr chen ram po po kha, LALPA chanpuol nîng a tih, sukdar ni naw nih a, kumkhuoin pei thlâk khawm ni bawk naw nih."
