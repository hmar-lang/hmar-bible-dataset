1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.",Juda ram lal Zedekia inlal kum sâwmnaa LALPA kuoma inthawka Jeremia kuoma thu hung tlung chu; chu kum chu Nebukad- nezzar inlal kum sâwmpariet kum a nih.
2,"Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.","Chuongchun, chu huna chun Babulon lal sipaihai chun Jerusalem chu an inhuol a; chun, zâwlnei Jeremia khawm chu Juda ram lal ina vêngtu kulbînga chun khârkhumin a um a."
3,"For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;","Juda ram lal Zedekia chun ama chu a khum a, “Ieng dinga hienga thu hi i hril am a na?, ‘LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, hi khawpui hi Babulon lal kuta chun pêng ka ta, ama chun lâng a tih."
4,"and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;","Juda ram lal Zedekia khawm chu Kaldaihai kuta inthawk chun suok- thleng naw nih a; amiruokchu, Babulon lal kuta chun matheiloin pêk ni lem a tih, ama chu bau le bau inphâkin bieng a ta, a mithai chun ama mithai chu hmu bawk a tih;"
5,"and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?","chun, Zedekia chu Babulona chun ṭhuoi a ta, ka va sir hmakhat chun chutaka chun um zing a ta, LALPA chun a tih: Kaldaihai chu do unla khawm, hlawtling naw ti niu,’ i tih a,” a ta."
6,"And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Jeremia chun a hril a, “LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a, hieng hin a hril,"
7,"Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.","Ngai ta, i pami Sallum naupa Hanamel chu i kuomah hung a ta, ‘Anathotha um ka lo inchaw rawh, inchaw dinga intlansuokna thuneina chu nangma ta a ni sih a,’ tîng a ta."
8,"So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, ka pami naupa Hanamel chu vêngtu kulbînga chun LALPA thu ang pei chun ka kuomah a hung a, ka kuoma chun, ‘Ka ngên che, ka lo Anathotha um, Benjamin rama um chu inchaw rawh; rohluona thuneina chu nangma ta a ni sih a, intlansuokna khawm chu nangma ta bawk a na, i ta dingin inchaw el rawh,’ a hung tih a."
9,"And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.","Chun, kei chun chu chu LALPA thu a nih ti ka hriet a. Chun, ka pami naupa Hanamel lo Anathotha um chu kân châwk tah a; tangka shekel sâwm- pasari chu ama ka bûkpêk tah a."
10,"And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.","Chun, thuziek chu suoi ka thawh a, ka nam tah a, chun, hriet- puitu ka ko a, ama chu bûkna chun tangka chu ka bûkpêk tah a."
11,"So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, according to the law and custom, and that which was open:","Chun, dân ang le hmangchâng ang peiin, inchâwkna thuziek chu ka lâk a, chu chu hawng a na;"
12,"and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.","vêngtu kulbînga Juda ṭhanghai po po hmaa chun, inchâwkna thu- zieka hrietpuitu mithmua chun, ka pami naupa Hanamel hmaihmaah, inchâwkna thuziek chu Maaseia naupa, Neria naupa Baruk kuoma chun ka pêk tah a."
13,"And I charged Baruch before them, saying,","An hmaa chun Baruk chu thu ka pêk tah a,"
14,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.","‘Sipaihai LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: Hieng thuziek- hai, inchâwkna thuziek, chara um le hawngsaa um hi la la, pil bêlah va sie rawh; ni sâwttak el an um theina dingin."
15,"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.","Sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Inhai, lohai, grêp huonhai chu hi rama hin in- châwk la ni nâwk an tih a ti sih a,’” tiin."
16,"Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto Jehovah, saying,","“Chun, Neria naupa Baruk kuoma inchâwkna thuziek chu ka pêk hnung chun LALPA kuoma chun ka ṭawngṭai tah a."
17,"Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for thee,",‘Aw LALPA Pathien; i bân phar le i thilthawtheina ropuitak chun vân le hnuoi chu i siem a; nanga ta ding chun iengkhawm intak taluo a um nawh a;
18,"who showest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts is his name;","nang chun sâng kuoma zâ- ngaina inentira, pahai suolna chu an nauhai ângsûnga thungna petu, Pathien thilthawthei, ropui le, sipai- hai LALPA chu a hming a nih;"
19,"great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;","rorêlnaa ropui le, sinthawa thil- thawthei tak, mihriem nauhai um- dân po po hmu zing hlak; mi tin chu ama um dân le a thilthawhai ang peia pe dingin;"
20,"who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among other men; and madest thee a name, as at this day;","ama chun vawisûn ni chen hin Aigupta rama chun inchiknahai le thilmakhai chu a thawh a, Israel rama le mi danghai kuoma khawm; vawisûn nia ang hin ama chun hming a siempêk cheh a."
21,"and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;","Aigupta rama inthawkin i mi Israelhai chu inchiknahai dâm, thil- makhai dâm, kut hrât dâm le, bân phar dâm le ṭium nasatak leh i hung ṭhuoi suok a;"
22,"and gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;","hi ram nênetui le khuoizua luong ram, an thlatuhai kuoma pêk dinga i lo tiem ta ram hi an kuoma chun i pêk tah a;"
23,"and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.","chuongchun, an hung lût a, an nei a, nisienlakhawm, i râwl chu an awi nawh a, i dân khawm chu an zâwm bawk nawh a; anni chun thaw dinga thu i pêkhai a iengkhawm chu an thaw nawh a; chuleiin, thil ṭha naw tinrêng chu an chunga chun în tlungtir a,"
24,"Behold, the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.","en ta u, khawpui lâkna dingin hnuoi dêng pâwnghai an hung um ta hi, nangin hung tlung dinga i hril angin, hripui le, ṭâm le kâwlhnâm leiin, a hung dotu Kaldaihai kuta chun khawpui chu pêk a ni tah a; en ta, i hmu zing hi."
25,"And thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.","Ka kuoma chun Aw LALPA Pathien, “Lo chu tangkain inchaw la, hrepuituhai ko la,” i ta, nisienla- khawm, khawpui chu Kaldaihai kuta pêk a ni ta sih a,’” tiin."
26,"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu Jeremia kuomah a hung tlung a,"
27,"Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?","“Ngai ta, mi tinrêng Pathien, LALPA chu ka nih, keia ta dingin thil intak taluo a um am a nih?"
28,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:","Chuleiin, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, hi khawpui hi Kaldaihai kuta le Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar kuta chun pêng ka ta, ama chun lâng a tih;"
29,"and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.","chun, hi khaw hung dotu Kaldaihai chu hung an ta, hi khuo hi meiin hung râwng an ta, a inhai a chunga Baal kuoma riminhnik an râwna le, kei mi suklungsenna dinga pathien danghai kuoma dâwn mi thilinhlânhai an lo bunthlâkna inhai le chun kâng a tih."
30,"For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.","An naupang laia inthawk tah Juda thlahai le Israel thlahai hin ka mithmuah thil suol chu an lo thaw hlak sih a; Israel thlahai chun an kut sinthawhai chun an mi lo suklungsen sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
31,"For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,","Hi khawpui hi an bâwl ṭan nia inthawk vawisûn ni chen hin, keia ta ding chun ka ṭiumna le ka lungin- senna chawkthona chau a nih; chuongchun, ka hmaihmaa inthawk- in ka sawn hmang ding a nih;"
32,"because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Juda thlahai le Israel thlahai suolna po po, mi suklungsenna ding ela, anni le an lalhai le an rorêltuhai le, an thiempuhai le, an zâwlneihai le, Juda rama mihai le Jerusalem hluotuhaiin an lo thaw tahai lei chun."
33,"And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.","Chun, kei chu hmatieng ni loin, hnungtieng an mînnghat a, inhma- taka thoa anni inchûktirin, anni chu ka lo inchûktira chu, inchûktirna chu hre dingin an ngai si nawh a."
34,"But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.","Amiruokchu, an tirdakumna chu ka hming chawia sak in chu sukpawrche dingin an sieh a."
35,"And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.","Hinnom phairuoma um Baal bâwlhmunhai chu Molek kuoma an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai meia infethlengtirna dingin an bâwl a, Juda chu suol inthawtir dingin, hi tirdakumna dâm hi thâwng an tih ti ka lungrila khawm a lût ngainawh."
36,"And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:","“Chuleiin, tuhin, hi khawpui, ‘Hripui le, ṭâm le, kâwlhnâmah Babulon lal kuta pêk a ni tah,’ i ti chungthua hin Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih:"
37,"Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.","Ngai ta u, ka lunginsenna le ka ṭiumna le, ka lunginthaka anni ka hnawt hmangna ram po poa inthawk chun anni chu kei khâwm ka ta; hi hmuna hin hung ṭhuoi nâwk ka ta, himtakin inchêngtir ka tih;"
38,"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:","anni chu ka mihai nîng an ta, kei khawm an Pathien nîng ka tih;"
39,"and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:",kumkhuoa an mi ṭi theina dingin anni chu lungril pakhat le lampui pakhat chau pêng ka tih; anni le an hnunga an thlahai ṭhatna dingin.
40,"and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.","Anni chu sukṭha dingin, annia inthawka kân her hmang nawna dingin, anni le chun kumkhaw thu- thlung siem ka ta; chun, an lungrila chun keia ṭina sieng ka ta, keimaa inthawk chun fe hmang ta naw ni hai."
41,"Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.","Anih, anni chu sukṭha dingin an chungah hlim tâng ka ta, hi rama hin ka lungril po po le, ka lungvar po poin thudikah anni chu phun ka tih."
42,"For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Hi hnam chunga hieng thil ṭha naw nasatakhai po po kân tlungtir ang bawk hin, an chunga hin thil ṭha an kuoma ka tiem tahai po po chu hung intlungtir vêng ka tih."
43,"And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.","Chun, ‘Ramsahai le mihriem boin, râusan a ni tah a; Kaldaihai kuta pêk a ni tah,’ in ti, hi rama hin lohai chu inchâwk nîng a ta."
44,"Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith Jehovah.","Mihaiin lohai chu tangka sumin inchâwng an ta, thuziek chu ziek det an ta, châr an tih, hrietpuituhai ko an ta, Benjamin rama dâm, Jerusalem vêla hmunahai dâm, tlângram khaw- puiahai dâm, phairuoma khawpuia- hai dâm, Sima khawpuiahai dâm chun: an sal intângnaa inthawkin kân kîrtir ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih” tiin."
