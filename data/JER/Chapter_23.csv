1,Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith Jehovah.,Ka hlo petna hmuna berâmhai sukdara sukbohmanghai be- râmpuhai chu an chung a rik! LALPA chun a tih.
2,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.","Chuleiin, Israel Pathien LALPA chun, ka mihai châwmtu berâmpuhai chungthua chun hieng hin a hril: Ka berâm ruolhai chu in hnawt dar a, in khal hmang tâwl tah a, anni chu in va sir ngai bawk nawh a; ngai ta u, in thilthaw rilohai chun ka hung sir ding cheu a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
3,"And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.","Ka berâm ruol laia hlâbîkhai chu, ram anni ka hnawt hmangna po poa inthawk chun hung ṭhuoi khâwm ka ta, an huonhaia chun hung ṭhuoi nâwk ka tih; chun, hung pung an ta, hung rahlâwk an tih."
4,"And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith Jehovah.","Anni châwmtu ding berâmpu an chunga chun sieng ka ta; ṭit khawm ṭi ta naw ni hai a, beidawng ngai ta bawk naw ni hai a, tlâksam hrim khawm um ta naw ni, LALPA chun a tih."
5,"Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.","Ngai ta, nihai chu a hung tlung mêk; LALPA chun a tih: David-a hin kau feltak chu hung inṭotir ka ta, ama chun lal angin rorêl a ta, vartak- in thâwng a ta; rama chun rorêlna le felna chu suksuok a tih."
6,"In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.","Ama dam sûng chun Juda chu sandam nîng a ta, Israel khawm chu himtakin chêng a tih, chun, hi hi hming ama kona ding chu nîng a ta, “LALPA chu ei felna a nih,” ti hi."
7,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;","Chuleiin, ngai ta, nihai chu a hung tlung mêk, LALPA chun a tih; Aigupta rama Israel thlahai ṭhuoi suoktu LALPA chu a hring zing angin, ṭi ta naw ni hai a,"
8,"but, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.","Hmâr rama inthawk le anni ka hnawt hmangna ram po pohaia in- thawka Israel sûngkuo chu enkawla ṭhuoitu LALPA ti ni lem tâng a tih: chuongchun, anni ram ngeia chun chêng tâng an tih."
9,"Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.","Zâwlneihai chungthua chun; ka lungril chu ka sûnga chun a kawiseh a, ka ruhai po po khawm ân hnîng a; zu inrui mi, mi uoinin a hne zet ang el chu ka nih; LALPA lei le, LALPA thu inthienghai lei chun."
10,"For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;","Ram chu uirehaiin an sip a, ṭawngsie lei chun ram chun a sûn a; thlalêra hlo petna hmunhai khawm chu a ṭâwl zo a; an lampuihai chu a ṭha nawh a, an hrâtna khawm chu ân dik nawh."
11,"for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.","Thiempu le zâwlnei chu suk- pawrche an ni ve ve sih a; anih, ka ina chun an khawhlona chu ka hmu a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
12,"Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.","Chuleiin, an lampui chu an ta dingin inthim laia hmun innâltak ang chu nîng a ta; hnawtin um an ta, chutaka chun tlûng an tih, an chunga chun thil ṭha naw, anni hremna kum ngei chu ka hung intlungtir ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih."
13,"And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.","Samaria zâwlneihaia chun in- vêtna ka hmuh a, anni chun Baal hmangin thu an hril a, ka mi Israelhai chu an insuksuoltir a."
14,"In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.","Jerusalema zâwlneihaia khawm thil râpthlâktak ka hmuh a; anni chun uiretna thil an thawh a, thukhêlah an feh a, thilsuol thawtu kut chu an sukhrât a, chuongchun, tukhawm an khawhlonaa inthawkin an kîr nawh; an rêng el chun ka ta ding chun Sodom ang an na, chutaka a hluotuhai chu Gomorra ang an nih."
15,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.","Chuleiin, zâwlneihai chung- thua chun sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih; Ngai ta, anni chu sairamkhain châwm ka ta, mîtkhâ tui indâwntir ka tih; Jerusalem zâwlneihaia inthawk chun ram po poa chun sukpawrchena chu a fe suok sih a."
16,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: “In kuoma thuhriltu zâwlneihai thuhai chu ngai naw unla, anni chun teplo mei mei an inchûktir cheu a nih, an lungrila thil hmulâwk chu an hril a, LALPA baua inthawka mi chu ni loin."
17,"They say continually unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.","LALPA thuhai hmusittuhai kuoma chun, LALPA chun, ‘Thla- muongna nei in tih, a tih,’ an ti zing zing hlak a, chun, mi mâni lungril ngarzie ang peia um hlaktu kuoma khawm chun, ‘In chungah thil ṭha naw hung tlung naw nih,’ an ti bawk hlak a."
18,"For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it?",LALPA rorêlnaa chun tu am a thu chu hrea pawm dinga ngîr hlak? Tuin am a thuhai chu ân chikin a hriet hlak a?
19,"Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, even his wrath, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.","Ngai ta u, LALPA thlipui chu, a lunginsenna chu, a fe suok a, anih, thlivir thlipui chu, mi khawhlo lu chunga chun hung nuoi a tih."
20,"The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly.","Thawa a um hmakhat chun LALPA lunginsenna chu hung kîr nâwk naw ni, a lungrila a thiltum a thaw hmakhat chun: hi hnung tienga chun la hung hre chieng hlêng in tih."
21,"I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied.","Hieng zâwlneihai hi ka tir nawh a, anachu, an tlân sih a; an kuoma chun thu khawm ka hril nawh a, anachu, anni chun thu an hril sih a."
22,"But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.","Nisienlakhawm, ka rorêlnaa lo ngîr ta chu ni hai sienla, ka mihai chu ka thuhai chu inhriettir an ta, an thilthaw suolhaia inthawk le, an lampui suolhaia inthawk chun inkîr- tir tâng an tih."
23,"Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?","LALPA chun, ‘Hlataka Pathien um ni loin, hnaitaka Pathien ka ni maw?’ a tih."
24,Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah.,"LALPA chun, ‘Mi tukhawm ka hmu lo dingah hmun fienrielahai ân bihmang thei am a nih?’ a tih. ‘Hnuoi le vân chu keia suksip a ni naw am a nih?’ LALPA chun a tih."
25,"I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.","‘Mang ka nei, mang ka nei,’ tia ka hminga thukhêla thuhriltuhai, zâwlneihaiin an hril chu ka hriet a."
26,"How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?","Zâwlnei thukhêl hriltuhai, anni lungril inhlêmnaa zâwlneihai chu, chuonghai lungrila chun hi hi ieng- chen am a um ding a na?"
27,"that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal.","an thlatuhaiin Baal leia ka hming an theinghil anga, mi tinin mâni tuolbâwmhai kuomah an mang- hai an hrilin ka mihai chu ka hming intheinghiltir dingin an ngaituo a."
28,"The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? saith Jehovah.","Zâwlnei mang nei chun a mang chu hril sienla, keima thu hretu chun keia thu chu ringumtakin hril bawk raw se. Bu le a kûng chun ieng am inangna an nei a? LALPA chun a tih."
29,Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?,"Ka thu chu mei ang a ni nâwm a nih, lungpui khawm suknawitu tu- bau ang chu? LALPA chun a tih."
30,"Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.","“Chuleichun, ngai ta u, zâwl- neihai mâni tuolbâwmhaia inthawka ka thu inrutuhai chu ka kal a nih, LALPA chun a tih."
31,"Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.","Ngai ta u, an leihai hmanga, ‘LALPAIN a hril,’ titu zâwlneihai chu ka kal a nih, LALPA chun a tih:"
32,"Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith Jehovah, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, saith Jehovah.","Ngai ta u, mang indik lohai hrila, anni kuoma khawm hrila, an khêlhrilhai le, an uongna teplohaia ka mihai insuksuoltirtu zâwlneihai chu ka kal a nih, LALPA chun a tih; anni chu ka tir nawh a, thu khawm ka pêk nawh a; hi hnam hi suksâwt chuong dêr bawk naw ni hai, LALPA chun a tih.”"
33,"And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? then shalt thou say unto them, What burden! I will cast you off, saith Jehovah.","Hi mihai laia pakhatin amanih, zâwlneiin amanih, thiempuin ama- nih, “LALPA rikphur chu ieng am a na?” ti an indawn che chun, an kuoma chun, “Nangni hi phurrik chu in nih, ka peihâwn ding cheu a nih, LALPA chun a tih,” tiin hril rawh."
34,"And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house.","Chun, zâwlnei amanih, thiem- pu amanih, chu mi laia pakhat, “LALPA phurrik chu” titu chu kei khawma chu mi le a sûngkuo chu hrem ka tih."
35,"Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?","Chuongchun, mi tinin mâni tuolbâwmhai kuoma le mâni unau- pahai kuomah, “LALPA chun ieng am a dawn a? LALPA chun ieng am a hril a?” tiin hril in tih."
36,"And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more: for every man’s own word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God.","Chuongchun, LALPA phurrik chu hril ta ngai naw ti niu a, mi tin ta dingin ama thu ngei chu a phurrik a ni ding leiin; Pathien hring thuhai chu in lo fe kawipui ta sih a, ei Pathien sipaihai LALPA thu chu."
37,"Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath Jehovah answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?","Chuongchun, zâwlnei kuoma chun, “LALPA chun iengin am a dawn cheh a? LALPA chun ieng am a hril a?” tîng in ta."
38,"But if ye say, The burden of Jehovah; therefore thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;","Amiruokchu, “LALPA phurrik chu,” in ti chun, LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih: Hi thu “LALPA phurrik chu,” in ti leiin, “LALPA phurrik chu, in ti ding a ni nawh,” ti dingin in kuomah mi ka hung tir a;"
39,"therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence:","chuleiin, ngai ta u, nangni chu theinghil letdêr ka ti cheu a, khawpui nangni kuoma le in thlatuhai kuoma ka ipêk le hin ka hmaihmaa inthawk- in ka peihâwn ding cheu a nih;"
40,"and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.","chun, in chunga chun kum- khuoa um ding ṭawngsekawk chu hung intlun ka ta, inzakna re lo leh, chuong chu theinghil ni ta ngai naw ni hai."
