1,"Jehovah showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.","Chun, ngai ta, LALPA biekin hmaha sie theichang leikhawr pahni LALPA chun a mîn entir a; Babulon lal Nebukadnezzarin Juda lal Jehoiakim naupa Jekonia le Juda rama lalhai le, mi themthiemhai le, thîrsuhai chu Jerusalema inthawka salah a ṭhuoi a, Babulona a hung ṭhuoi tâwl hnung khan."
2,"One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.","Leikhâwr pakhata chun theichang ṭhatak tak el, theichang hmin hmasa ang kha a um a; leikhâwr danga chun theichang setak tak el, fâk thei lo khawpa sie chu a um a."
3,"Then said Jehovah unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Jeremia, ieng am i hmuh a?” a mi ta. Kei chun, “Theichanghai, theichang ṭha, ṭha êm êm le, a ṭha naw, ṭha naw takmeu el, fâk thei lo khawpa sie,” ka tih a."
4,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a."
5,"Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.","“LALPA Israel Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: An ṭhatna dinga, Juda sal intâng, hi hmuna inthawka Kaldai rama ka tirhai chu hi thei- chang ṭhahai ang hin ngai ka ta."
6,"For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.","An ṭhatna dingin an chungah ka mit inlên ka ta; chuongchun, hi rama ma hin hung ṭhuoi nâwk ka tih; chun, anni chu tungding ka ta, keihnuoi naw ningah; anni chu phun ka ta, phawi naw ningah."
7,"And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.","An kuoma chun, LALPA ka nih ti mi hre dingin lungril pêng ka ta; chuongchun, ka mihai nîng an ta, kei khawm an Pathien nîng ka tih; an lungril po po leh ka kuomah an hung kîr nâwk ding a ni sih a."
8,"And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus saith Jehovah, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt,","Chun, theichang ṭha nawhai, fâk thei lo khawp hiela siehai ang chun, Juda ram lal Zedekia le, a lalhai le, Jerusalema la mahlahai, hi rama la chênghai le chun, Aigupta rama chênghai po po le chun nghatsan ka tih, LALPA chun a tih;"
9,"I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.","anni chu thil ṭha nawa hnung- tieng hmatienga sukṭita um dingin hnuoia lalram po pohai lai chun pe suok ka tih; ṭawngsekawk le, thuvara le hrânghla le inkhâmna ni dingin, anni ka hnawt suokna ding hmun po poahai chun pe suok ka tih."
10,"And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.","Chun, anni le an thlatuhai kuoma ram ka pêka inthawka an rênga an bohmang vawng hmakhat chun an hnunga chun kâwlhnâm dâm, hripui dâm, ṭâm dâm tir bawk ka tih,” tiin."
