1,"The word of Jehovah came also unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a;
2,"Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters, in this place.","“Nuhmei nei naw ti nih a, hi hmuna hin naupasalhai, naunuhmei- hai khawm nei bawk naw ti nih."
3,"For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land:","Hi hmuna pieng naupasalhai chungthu dâm, naunuhmeihai chungthu dâm, hi ram anni chawitu an nu chungthu dâm, anni neitu an pa chungthu dâm chu LALPA chun hieng hin a lo hril ta sih a;"
4,"They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.","Thina lungngaiumtakin thîng an ta, ṭa khawm ṭa ni naw ni hai a, phûm khawm phûm ni naw ni hai; leihnuoi chunga êkdûr ang chau nîng an ta, ṭâmna le kâwlhnâm chun anni chu fâkzoin um an tih; chun, an ruonghai chu chunglêng vatehai le hnuoi chunga ramsahai ta dinga bu nîng a tih."
5,"For thus saith Jehovah, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, even lovingkindness and tender mercies.","LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Lusûn ina chun lût naw unla, ṭa dingin fe bawk naw unla, anni chu sûn bawk naw ro; hi hnama inthawk hin ka thlamuongna chu ka lâk hmang ta sih a, LALPA chun a tih, lunginsietna le zângaina innêmtak el chu."
6,"Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;","Hi rama hin a lien le a chîn khawm thîng an ta; phûmin um naw ni hai a, mihai khawma anni chu ṭa naw ni hai, anni le anni khawm in ât naw ni hai, an ta dingin an lu suk- kâwk bawk naw ni hai;"
7,"neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.","mithihai leia anni thlamuon dingin, mihai chun sûnna dingin bei khawi naw ni hai a; an nuhai amanih, an pahai amanih dâwn dingin sûn- puina nohai chu pe bawk naw ni hai."
8,"And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.","Anni le ṭhunga, faa, dâwn dingin ruoiṭhena inah i fe ding a ni nawh."
9,"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.","Israel Pathien sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Ngai ta u, i nihaia hin, in mithmua inthawkin hlimna râwl ri dâm, lâwmna râwl ri dâm, mo neitu râwl ri dâm le monu râwl ri dâm chu hi hmuna inthawk hin ka suktâwp ding a nih."
10,"And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against Jehovah our God?","“Chun, hieng thuhai po po hi hieng mihai kuoma hin în entir pha chun i kuoma chun ‘Iengleiin am hieng thil ṭha naw nasatakhai hi kan chungah LALPA chun a hung sâk- suok am a na? Annawleh, ieng am a na kan khawhlona chu? LALPA kan Pathien chunga kan lo thaw tah, kan suolna chu ieng am a na?’ tîng an ta;"
11,"then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;","nang chun an kuomah, ‘In thla- tuhai chun an mi lo nghatsan tah a, LALPA chun a tih: Pathien danghai chu an zui a, a rawng an bâwl a, anni chu chibai an bûk a, kei chu an mi lo mâksan a, ka dân khawm an lo zâwm ta naw lei khan a nih,"
12,"and ye have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that ye hearken not unto me:","in thlatuhai nêk hman chun thil suol in thaw lem a, ngai ta u, mi tin el chu mâni lungril ngarna ang peia fein, keia thu chu in ngai ta nawh a;"
13,"therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that ye have not known, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.","Chuleiin, hi rama inthawk hin nangni le in thlatuhai khawma an hriet ngailo rama chun ka hnawt suok ding cheu a nih; chutaka chun a sûn a zânin pathien danghai rawng bâwl in tih; ditsakna kân hmutir âwm si naw cheu a,’ a tih,” tiin."
14,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;","Chuleiin, ngai ta, nihai a hung tlung, LALPA chun a tih, “LALPA Aigupta rama inthawka Israel thla- hai hung ṭhuoi suoktu chu a hring zing angin,” ti ni ta naw nih a,"
15,"but, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries whither he had driven them. And I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.","amiruokchu, “LALPA hmâr tieng rama inthawk le, anni a hnawt hmangna ram po poa inthawka Israel thlahai hung ṭhuoi suoktu kha a hring zing leiin,” ti ni lem tâng a tih; an thlatuhai kuoma ka lo pêk tah, an rama ngei khan anni chu ka hung ṭhuoi nâwk ding a ni sih a."
16,"Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, nga man mi tamtak ko suok ka ta, anni chu nga manin man an ta; chu hnunga chun ramsuok- tuhai tamtak ko suok ka ta, tlâng tinhaia le, muol tinhaia le, lungpui kuo kârhaia chun anni chu pêl an tih."
17,"For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes.","An lampuihai po po chu ka mit chun a en zing a, ka hmaia inthawka thup an ni nawh a, ka mithmua inthawkin an suolnahai khawm chu thup a ni bawk nawh."
18,"And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled mine inheritance with their abominations.","Chun, a hmasatakin, an khaw- hlona le suolna chu a let hniin thung ka ta, ka ram chu an thil thienglo ruokhai chun an lo sukpawrche tah a, ka rochan khawm an tirdakumna chun an lo suksip ta leiin."
19,"O Jehovah, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nought but lies, even vanity and things wherein there is no profit.","Aw LALPA, ka hrâtna le ka kulpui nghet le rinum nia ka himna; leihnuoi tâwphaia inthawk chun hnamhai chu i kuomah hung an ta, “Kan thlatuhai chun khêlhlip chau, teplo le, thil a hlâwkna um dêr lohai chau naw chu iengkhawm an lo rochung nawh a,” hung tîng an tih."
20,"Shall a man make unto himself gods, which yet are no gods?","Mihriem chun ama ta dingin pathienhai ni si lo, pathienhai chu ân siempêk ding am a nih?"
21,"Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.","Chuleiin, ngai ta, hieng hi in- hriettir ka ta, vawi khat chu ka thilthawtheina le ka kut chu inhriet- tir ka tih; chun, ka hming chu Jehova a nih ti hre tâng an tih."
