1,"Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof?","Ammon thlahai chungchâng thu chu: LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: “Israel hin naupasal a nei naw a ni maw? Rohluotu ding a nei naw maw? Chuong a ni si chun ieng dinga Milkom hin Gad hi a nei a, a mihai chu khawpuia hai chun chêng am an nih a?"
2,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that did possess him, saith Jehovah.","Chuleiin, ngai ta u, nihai chu a hung tlung mêk, LALPA chun a tih: Ammon thlahai Rabba chunga chun indona ṭhâwnglâwk ri chu hriet ngei dingin inumtir ka ta; chuongchun, râusan hmun pâwng el hung nîng a ta; a naunuhmeihai chu meiin kâng an tih; chuongchun, ama lo neitu chu Israel chun nei ve thung a ta, LALPA chun a tih."
3,"Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.","Aw Hesbon ṭap inrûm rawh, Ai chu suksiet a ni ta sih a; nangni Rabba naunuhai, khêk unla, saiip puon inbel unla, ṭap unla, a daihai laia chun hnungtieng hmatieng tlân inlawn ro; Milkom chu a thiempuhai leh a rorêltuhai leh sala intâng dingin a fe ding a ni sih a."
4,"Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?","Iengdinga phairuomahai chun în chawimawi am a na?

5,"Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.","Ngai ta, i chunga chun ṭitna ka hung intlungtir ding a nih, sipaihai PATHIEN, Lalpa chun a tih: i vêla umhai po poa inthawk chun inumtir ka ta; mi tin chu hnawt suok letdêr an ti cheu a, ân vâkhmang tahai chu kei khâwmtu ding tukhawm um naw ni hai."

7,Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?,"Edom chungthu, Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: “Temana chun varna a um ta naw a ni maw? Mi vara inthawka thurâwn an bohmang ta a ni maw? An varna chu a bohmang a ni ta maw?"
8,"Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him.","Tlân hmang unla, hnung kîr unla, chêng inthûk unla, Aw Dedan hluotuhai, ama chunga chun Esau lunginzîngna chu ka hung intlungtir ding a ni sih a, ama ka hrem hun ngei chu."
9,"If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?","Grêp ra lotuhai chu i kuomah hung hai sienla, grêp hmu ṭhel ṭhenkhat an mâksan naw ding maw? Zânah inru hung sienla, an dittâwk an nei hmakhat chu an suksiet naw ding maw?"
10,"But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not.","Esau chu ruoka ka sie a na, ân bîkna hmunhai chu ka suklangpêk a, ama le ama chu inthup thei naw nih; a chi chu suksiet a na, a unauhai le a tuolbâwmhai le, ama chu a um ta nawh."
11,"Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.","I nau pa bohai kha mâksan la, keiin hringin hlâng ka tih; chun, i hmeithai khawm chun mi ring bawk raw se."
12,"For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.","“LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Ngai ta u, an kuoma no dâwn phâk nawhai chun dâwn ngei ngei an ta; anleh nang chu hrem lo dinga um hrim hrim am i nih? Hrem lo ni naw tawp i tih; i dâwn ve ngei ngei ding a nih."

14,"I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.","LALPA kuoma inthawkin chan- chin lâwmum ka hriet a; ‘Nangni le nangni hung inkhâwm unla, ama hung do unla, indonaah hung tho ro,’ tiin, aiawtu pakhat chu hnamhai laia chun tir a nih."

18,"As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.","Sodom le Gomorra le chu kâwl vêla khawpuihai suksiet ang khan, chutaka chun tukhawm chêng naw ni hai, tukhawm inzinah va fe bawk naw ni hai, LALPA chun a tih."
19,"Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me?","Ngai ta u, ama chu tlatna hmun pângngaia chun Jordan vadung fâwna inthawk chun sakeibaknei ang elin hung a ta; amiruokchu, ama kuoma inthawk chun intlânsiettir vak ka tih; chun, mi tukhawm thlang- a um chu, ama chunga chun ruot ka ta, tu am keia ang an um a?

20,"Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.","Chuleiin, Edom khaw chung- thua LALPAIN thurâwn a ilâktak le, a thiltum, Teman hluotuhai chunga lo tum ta chu lo ngai ta u; matheiloin, anni chu ran ruol têhai hnûk hmangin um ngei ngei an ta an chêngna chu anni irâusanin siempêk a tih."

22,"Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.","Ngai ta u, hung suok a ta, mu- pui angin vuong a tih, chun, a thlahai chu Bozra chunga chun phar a ta; chun, chu nia chun Edoma mi thil- thawtheihai lungril chu nuhmei na tuor lai lungril ang nîng a tih” tiin."
23,"Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.","Damaska chungthu chu. Hamath chu ân zak, Arpad leh; chan- chin ṭha lo an lo hriet a, an intuihmang ta si a; tuisuoriet infâwn re thei lo angin an buoi a."
24,"Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.","Damaska chu a hung hrât nawh a, tlân hmang dingin ân her a; inthinnain ama chu a man a; thuok- dawngna le lungngaium chun ama a chel tlat tah a; nuhmei nauhase nat tuor ang elin."
25,"How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?","Iengtiziea inpâkna khawpui, ka hlimna khawpui hi nghatsana um am a na?"

28,"Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith Jehovah: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.","Kedar le Hazor ram Babulon lal Nebukadnezzarin a rûnhai chungthu chu.

29,"Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side!","An puon inhai le an ran ruolhai chu lâng an ta; an ta dingin an puonhai, an bûr le bêlhai po po le an sanghâwngseihai po po ṭhuoi hmang an tih; chun, an kuoma chun, ‘Kil tina ṭitna ruok a nih,’ tiin mi khêk an tih."
30,"Flee ye, wander far off, dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.","Tlânse unla, hlatakah invâk unla, tlumhmang dai ro, Aw Hazor hluotuhai, LALPA chun a tih; Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chun in chunga thurâwn a siem tah a, in chunga thiltum a nei ta sih a."
31,"Arise, get you up unto a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith Jehovah; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.","Tho unla, hnam nuomsipa khawsa le pawisak hrim nei lo an khâta chênga, dai kawtkhâr amanih, kawtkhâr thîrhai amani khawm nei lo hai chu thaw ro, LALPA chun a tih."
32,"And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners of their hair cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith Jehovah.","Chun, an sanghâwngseihai chu râllâkthilhai nîng an ta, an ran ruolhai khawm chu râllâksum ni bawk an tih; chun, barêp vawhai chu kâwlkil po poah sukdar ka tih, chun, anni kil tina inthawk chun an lungin- zingna ding chu hung intlungtir ka ta, LALPA chun a tih."
33,"And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.","Chun, Hazor chu sihalhai ta dinga chêngna hmuna le, kumkhaw râusan nîng a ta, chutaka chun tu- khawm chêng naw ni hai a, mihriem nau tukhawm chutaka chun inzin khawm vân zin bawk naw ni” tiin."

35,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.","“Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, an thilthawtheina laili Elam thalngul chu sukthliek ka tih."
36,"And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.","Chun, Elam chunga chun vân hmun palihaia inthawka thli palihai chu hung inhrângtir ka ta, chu thli fena tienga chun anni chu sukdar vawng ka tih, Elama inthawka hnaw dawkhai tlung nawna hnam hrim hrim um naw ni hai."
37,"And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith Jehovah; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:","Chuongchun, Elam chu an hmêlmahai hmaa beidawng dingin siem ka ta, an hringna zawngtuhai hmaa le chun. Chun, an chunga chun thil ṭha naw, ka lunginsenna ṭiumtak chu hung intlungtir ka tih, LALPA chun a tih; chun, an hnunga chun kâwlhnâm inhnawttir ka ta, anni chu ka sukbohmang vawng hmakhat chun;"
38,"and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith Jehovah.","chun, Elama chun ka lalṭhung- pha chu inṭhut ka ta, chutaka lal le rorêltuhai chu sukbohmang ka tih; LALPA chun a tih."
39,"But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, ni nuhnungahai chun hieng hi hung nîng a ta; Elam sal intângna chu hung la kîr nâwk ka tih, LALPA chun a tih” tiin."
