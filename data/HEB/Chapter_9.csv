1,"Now even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, a sanctuary of this world.","Chun, thuthlung hmasa khawm khan Pathien rawngbâwl dânhai le, a hmun inthieng, hi khawvêla hmun inthieng chu a nei a."
2,"For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein were the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.","Biekbûk an siem a, a tawntir chu khâwnvar siena dâm, dâwkân dâm, entirna bei siena a nih, chu chu Hmun Inthieng an ti a nih."
3,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;","Chun, puonzâr pahnina khêla chun biekbûk Hmun Inthieng Tak an ti chu a um a;"
4,"having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;","chutaka chun riminhnik râwna rângkachak bâwm le, thuthlungna bâwm rângkachak tuia inluon chu a um a; chu thuthlungna bâwm sûnga chun, manna umna rângkachak bêl dâm, Aron hmawl hung inder dâm, thuthlungna lungphêk dâm a um a;"
5,and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally.,"a chungtiengah zângaina ṭhung- pha hliein, ropuina Cherubhai an um bawk a; chuong thuhai chu tuhin chu a kip a kawiin hril thei nâwm ei nih."
6,"Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;","Chun, chuong thilhai chu chuong anga siem a lo na, Thiempuhaiin Pathien rawng bâwlin biekbûk tawntira chun an lût rawp hlak a;"
7,"but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:","a dawttua ruok chun Thiempu Laltak chau kum tin vawikhat thisen chawi ngeiin a lût hlak, chu chu mihai le ama suolna ta dingin ân hlân hlak."
8,"the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;","Thlarau Inthiengin hi hi ân hriettir a; Hmun inthienga lûtna lampui chu a lân lang hri nawh a, biekbûk tawntir chu a la ngîr sûng chun, ti hi;"
9,"which is a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect,","chu chu tulai tekhina hi a nih; chuong ang peiin thilpêk le in- thawinahai khawm an inhlân hlak, chuonghai chun sie le ṭha hrietna kawnga chun a betu chu a sukfamkim thei nawh;"
10,"being only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.","chuong chu fâk ding dâm, dâwn ding dâm, sâwp ding dang dang dâm leh, tisa tieng dânhai chau siem ṭhat hun hmaa dinga ruot chu a nih."
11,"But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,","Nisienlakhawm, Krista chu thil ṭha hung um dinghaia Thiempu Laltak hung niin, biekbûk kuta bâwl naw, (chu chu hieng thilsiem laia mi hi a ni nawh tina a nih), ropui le famkim lem fe thlengin,"
12,"nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.","ei ta dingin chatuona intlanna hmu tain, kêlte le bâwngte thisen lei ni loin, ama thisen lem leiin, Hmun Inthienga chun vawikhatah a lût thleng ta nghâl a."
13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:","Kêl le bâwngchalhai thisen le, bâwngla vâm mi inthieng naw chunga the hmanin tisa inthieng khawpa a sukthieng si chun,"
14,"how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?","Krista, chatuona Thlarau hmêl- hem loa Pathien kuoma inhlân thisen chun Pathien hring rawng bâwl dingin in sie le ṭha hrietna chu thilthaw thihaia inthawk chun a va sukthieng nasa âwm de!"
15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.","Chun, hi lei hin ama chu thuthlung thar palai chu a nih, thuthlung hmasa hnuoia bawsiet- nahaia inthawk intlanna dingin mi a lo thi ta leiin, koa umhai chun chatuona ro hluo ding chu chang thei an tih."
16,"For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.",Thurosie umna taphawtah a sietu thina um ve naw thei a ni si nawh a.
17,For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.,"Mi an thi hnungin thurosie chun thu a nei sih a, a sietu a la dam sûng chun thu a nei hlak am a nih?"
18,Wherefore even the first covenant hath not been dedicated without blood.,"Chuongchun, thuthlung hmasa khawm kha thisen naw chun an sukdet nawh."
19,"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,","Dân thu ang peiin thupêk taphawt chu Mosiein mi po po a hril hnungin bâwngte le kêlte thisen chu, tui le senlâr le, husawp leh a lâk a, lekhabu ngei le mi po po khawm chu a theh a."
20,"saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.","“Hi hi Pathienin in kuoma a pêk tlat thuthlung thisen a ni hi,” tiin."
21,Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.,Chu naw khawm chu biekbûk le rawngbâwlna hmangruo po po chu chuong ang bawk chun thisen chun a the tah a.
22,"And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.","Chun, Dân chun chu iengkim deuthaw hi thisena sukthiengin a um hlak a, thisen insuo naw chun ngai- damna hrim a um nawh."
23,It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.,"Chuongchun, vâna thil um anghai chu sukthiengin a um hrim ding a nih, vân thil taktakhai ruok chu chuong nêka inthawina ṭha lem haiin sukthiengin a um ding a nih."
24,"For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:",Krista chu kuta bâwl hmun inthieng a tak angpuia chun a lût si nawh a; tuhin Pathien hmaa ei aia ngîr dingin vâna ngei a lût ta lem a;
25,"nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;","nisienlakhawm, Thiempu Lal- tak chu kum tinin, mâni thisen naw, thisen chawi puma Hmun Inthiengah a lût hlak angin, ama chu mâni inhlân rawp dingin a lût naw bawk a,"
26,else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.,"chuongchu ni naw sienla leilung insieng tira inthawk vawi tamtak a tuor ta ding a na; nisienlakhawm, tulai hun tâwpa hin inthâwina dinga inhmang fâwmin, suol sukbona dingin vawi khatah a hung inlang ta nghâl a nih."
27,"And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this cometh judgment;","Chun, mihriem ta dingin vawi khat thi ruot a nih, chu hnunga chun rorêlna um a tih;"
28,"so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.","chuong ang bawkin Krista khawm mi tamtakhai suol fepui dinga vawi khat inhlâna um tain, sandamna hmu dinga ama lo nghâktuhai kuoma chun, suol ṭhang loin vawi hninaah hung inlang nâwk a tih."
