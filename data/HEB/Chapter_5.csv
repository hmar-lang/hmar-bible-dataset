verse_no,en,hmr
1,"For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:","Thiempu Laltak taphawt, suolna- hai leia thilpêk le inthâwina ân hlân kawp theina dingin, mihriem laia inthawka lâk tuma lo umin, Pathien tieng thilhaia chun mihriem- hai ta dingin ruot an ni hlak sih a."
2,"who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;","Chuonghai chun iengkhawm hre nawhai le lampui inhmanghai chungah zai an daw thei hlak a nih, anni ngei khawm hrât nawna inhuol vêla an um bawk leiin."
3,"and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.","Chun, chu lei chun, mihai ta dinga an inhlânpêk angin, anni ta ding ngei khawmin suolhai leiin in- hlân ve naw thei an ni nawh."
4,"And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.","Chun, tûkhawmin chu chawi- mawina chu mâni ta dingin an inbel ngai nawh. Aron anga Pathien iko an ni naw chun."
5,"So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee:","Chuong ang bawkin Krista khawm chu Thiempu Laltaka siem dingin mâni ân sukropui nawh a, “Nang chu ka Naupa i na, Vawisûn hin ka nei che a nih,” tia hriltu khan a sukropui ta lem a nih;"
6,"as he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.","“Nang chu Melkizedek um dân anga Chatuon Thiempu i nih,” tia hmun danga a hril ang khan."
7,"Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,","Ama chun a tisa put lai nihaia khan thinaa inthawka ama sandam theitu kuoma khan nasataka khêk le mitthli tla puma ṭawngṭainahai le hninahai ân hlân a, a ṭi dêk leiin ngaiin a um a,"
8,"though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;",Naupa rau ni sienla khawm a thil tuorhaia chun thu âwi ân chûk tah a nih;
9,"and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation;","chuongchun, sukṭhat famkima hung umin a thu awi po pohai ta dingin chatuona sandamna bulpui a hung ni tah a,"
10,named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.,Melkizedek um dân anga Thiempu Laltakah Pathienin ân bûk tah a.
11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing.","Chu mi chanchina chun hril ding tamtak kan nei a, hrilfie khawm ân tak, in na a lo sêt ta leiin."
12,"For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.","A hun ngaituo chun inchûktirtu ni rau ta âwm in nia chu, Pathien thu inchûktirna bulhai chu inchûktir in ngai nâwk tah a; bu rum ni loa, nênetui la ngai mi ang in hung ni nâwk ta hi."
13,For every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.,"Nênetui ring taphawt chun felna thua chun hrietna an nei nawh a, nautê an la ni leiin."
14,"But solid food is for fullgrown men, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.","Bu rum ruok chu puitlinghai ta dingin a nih, chuonghai chun asie aṭha hrefie dingin an hriettheina chu hmangin an sâwizawi tah."
