1,"Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.","Chuleiin, ṭîng ei tiu, chuong naw chun, a châwlnaa lûtna thutiema la umin, nangni laiah tûkhawm tling naw angin lo um hlau rawi in tih."
2,"For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard.","An kuoma hril a ni ang bawk khan Chanchin Ṭha chu ei kuoma hril a ni ngei sih a; nisienlakhawm, an thu ngai chun anni a sukṭhahnem si nawh a, ngaitu taktakhai leh ringnaa zawmin an um naw leiin."
3,"For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.","Eini ring tahai hi chu châwlnaa chun ei lût zing a nih. “Ka lungsena kân khâm ang khan, Ka châwlnaa chun lût naw ni hai,” a ti ang khan, leilung insieng tira sinhai chu thaw zo ni ta sien khawm."
4,"For he hath said somewhere of the seventh day on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;","Khâwlai hmuna manih ni sari ni thu hieng ang hin a hril a nih, “Chun, ni sari nia chun Pathienin a sinthaw po po a châwl san tah a,” tiin,"
5,"and in this place again, They shall not enter into my rest.","Chun hi hmuna hin, “Ka châwlnaa chun lût naw ni hai,” a ti nâwk a."
6,"Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,","Chuongchun, ṭhenkhat chu châwlnaa chun an la lût ding thu a um leiin le, inhmaa Chanchin Ṭha hril dawngtuhai chu awi naw leia an lût ta naw leiin,"
7,"he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before), To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts.","sâwttak hnung khan David chun, “Vawisûn hin,” tiin ni ieng amanih a ruot nawn nâwk a nih, “Vawisûn hin a râwl in hriet chun, In lungril sukngar naw ro,” tia a hmaa ka hril ang khan."
8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.","Josua chun anni chu ân châwltir ta si chun, chu hnunga chun ni dang thu chu hril naw ni."
9,There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.,"Chuongchun, Pathien mihai ta ding chun Châwlnia châwlna a la um ta rawp a."
10,"For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.","A châwlnaa lût ta chu, Pathienin ama sinthawhai a châwl san ang khan ama khawm chun a sinthawhai a châwl san ve tah a."
11,"Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.","Chuongchun, tûkhawm chu thuawi nawna leia an tlûk anga ei tlûk nâwna dingin, chu châwlnaa lût ding chun ṭhahnem ngai ei tiu."
12,"For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.","Pathien thu hi a hring a, thil a thaw thei a, kâwlhnâm ngeituo ieng ang nêk khawmin a ngei a, hringna le thlarau, rulechâng le thlin kawi dar khawp hielin a sun thei a, lungrila ngaituo le tumhai hi a hriet nghâl thei a nih."
13,And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.,Thil siem ama mithmua inlang naw hrim hrim a um nawh. Ei chanchin ei intlunna ding mithmua chun iengkim saruok le inhawng sain a um lem a nih.
14,"Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.","Chuongchun, vânahai fe thleng tah, Thiempu Laltak ropuitak, Isu Pathien Naupa chu ei nei leiin, ei thuring hi pawm tlat ei tiu."
15,"For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.","Thiempu Laltak ei hrât nawzie inhrietnahai mi hrietpui phâk naw nei ei ni si nawh a. Eini anga kawng tinrênga thlêmna tuok tah, suol ruok chu suol naw nei ei ni lem."
16,"Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help us in time of need.","Chuongchun, zângaina ei hmu theina ding le, ṭhangpui ei ngai phaa ṭhangpuina lunginsietna chu ei hmu theina dingin lunginsietna lalṭhung- pha chu huoitakin hnai ei tiu."
