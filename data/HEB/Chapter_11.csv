1,"Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.","Chun, ringna hi thil beiseihai um ngeia hrietna, thil hmu lohai hrietchiengna a nih."
2,For therein the elders had witness borne to them.,Chutaka chun upahai khan inpâk an hlaw sih a.
3,"By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.","Ringnain khawvêlhai hi Pathien thua siem fel diem a ni ta ti ei hriet, chuongchun, thil hmu theihai hi thil inlang theihaia siem a ni nawh."
4,"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.","Ringnain Abel chun Kaina nêkin inthâwina ṭha lem Pathien kuomah ân hlân a, chu lei chun mi fel a nih ti inhriettirna a hlaw a, Pathienin a thilpêkhai kawnga chun thu ân hriettir a, chun, chu ringna lei chun ama chun thi ta hnungin thu a la hril ta rawp a nih."
5,"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:","Ringnain Enok kha thina hre lo dinga lâk hmangin a lo um a. Chun, Pathienin a lâk hmang ta leiin hmu thei a ni ta nawh a. Lâk hmanga a um hmain Pathien lâwm zâwng mi a ni ti inhriettir a ni ta hrim a."
6,"and without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing unto him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.","Nisienlakhawm, ringna naw chun ama lâwm zâwng mi ni ruol a ni nawh; Pathien kuoma hung chun ama chu a um ti le, a zawngtuhai kuomah lâwmman pe hmang a nih, ti ring ding a nih."
7,"By faith Noah, being warned of God concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.","Ringnain Noa chu thil la hung inlang lohai kawng thuah Pathien hrila lo umin Pathien ṭidêkin, ama sûngkuo sandamna dingin lawng a tuk a; chu chun khawvêl chu thiemnaw ân changtir tah a, ringna leia felna um ro chu hluotu a lo ni tah a."
8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.","Ringnain Abraham chu koa a um lai khan, a rohluo ding hmuna lût dingin fe suok thu chu a pawm tah a; chun, a fena ding tieng khawm hre loin a fe suok tah a."
9,"By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:","Ringnain ram tiema khan mi rama châm ang elin a lo châm ta zing a, thutiem hmunkhat, ro a ihluopui ding Isak le Jakob hai angin puon inahai a lo um a;"
10,"for he looked for the city which hath the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.","khuo, lungphûmhai nei mi, Pathien ibâwl le siem chu a nghâk zing leiin."
11,"By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:","Ringnain Sara ngei khawmin, a tiemtu chu ringuma a ruot leiin tar ta hnungin chi pai theina a hmuh a."
12,"wherefore also there sprang of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand, which is by the sea-shore, innumerable.","Chuongchun, pasal pakhat, mi- thi ang el ni tahnunga inthawkin, vâna arasihai anga tam, tuisuoriet panga phaiphin anga tiem sêng naw an hung suok tah a."
13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.","Chuong po po chu ringna neiin an thi tah a, thiltiemhai chu chang loin; nisienlakhawm, chuong chu hlataka inthawka hmuin chibai an lo bûk tah a, hnuoia hin mikhuol le khuolfe el an ni ti an inhriettir ta bawk a."
14,For they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own.,Chuong ang thu hriltuhai chun anni ram ding an zawng ti a suklang sih a.
15,"And if indeed they had been mindful of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.","Chun, an suokna ram chu lung- kham hai sien chu fena remchâng an hmu ngei ta ding a nih."
16,"But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu ram ṭha nâwkzuol châk an na, chu chu vâna um a nih. Chuongchun, Pathienin an Pathien tia um chu ân zak nawh, an ta dingin khuo chen a lo buotsaipêk ta sih a."
17,"By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac: yea, he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten son;","Ringnain Abraham chu fiea a um khan Isak ân hlân a; anih, thutiemhai lâwmtaka changtu chun, a naupa khât nei sun chu ân hlân a,"
18,"even he to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:","“Isaka hin i thlahai tîng an tih,” a ti ang ngei khan;"
19,"accounting that God is able to raise up, even from the dead; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back.",Pathienin mithi laia inthawkin a keitho thei ti hrein chutaka chun thi ta hnung keitho angin a hmu nâwk ta ngei bawk a.
20,"By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.",Ringnain Isak chun thil la hung tlung dinghai thuah Jakob le Esau mal a sâwmpêk a.
21,"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.","Ringnain Jakob chun, a thi ding lai khan, Josef nauhai chu mal a sâwm ve ve a; a hmawl hmawr ring ringsanin Pathien a biek bawk a."
22,"By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.","Ringnain Josef chun, a thi a hung hnai khan, Israel thlahai suok ding thu a hril a, a ruhai kawng thuah thu a pêk bawk a."
23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.","Ringnain Mosie a pieng lai khan, nautê hmêlṭha tak a ni leiin, thla thum sûng a nu le pa thup- hmangin a um a; lal thupêk khawm an ṭi nawh."
24,"By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;","Ringnain Mosie chun, a hung puitling hnung khan, Pharao naunu naupaa inbûk chu a nuom nawh a."
25,"choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;",Sâwt nawtê kâr suol inhawina hlimpui nêk chun Pathien mihai le suknawmnat tuor a thlang ta lem a;
26,accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward.,"Krista an hmusitna chu Aigupta ram rohai nêk chun sum ropui lemah a ruot a, lâwmman pêk ding chu a thlîr hlak leiin."
27,"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.","Ringnain lal lunginsenna chu ṭi loin Aigupta ram a mâksan a, hmu thei naw Pathien chu a hmu leiin a tuor fan fan a nih."
28,"By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.","Ringnain Fekân Ruoiṭhe le thisen the kha a siem a, nau lutir sukbohmangtu chun anni a tâwk nâwna dingin."
29,By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up.,"Ringnain khawmuola fe angin Tuisuoriet Sena khan an fe kai a; Aiguptahaiin chu chu thaw an tum ve a, lem zoin an um tah a."
30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days.",Ringnain Jeriko kul kha ni sari an inhuol hnungin a chim tah a.

32,"And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:","Chun, ieng am la hril rawp ka ta? Gideon thu dâm, Barak thu dâm, Samson thu dâm, Jephtha thu dâm, David thu dâm, Samuel thu dâm, zâwlneihai thu dâm hril lang hunin mi dai si naw nih a."
33,"who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,","Chuonghai chun ringnain ram- hai an lâk a, thil fel an thawh a, thutiemhai an chang a, sakeibaknei khâkhai an sukchîp a, mei thilthaw- theina an sukmit a, kâwlhnâm ngei chenin an pumpel a."
34,"quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.","Hrât nawnaa inthawka hrâttak- a siemin an um a, indonaa chun mi hrât khawkhêng an lo na, hnam dang indo pâwlhai an intlânsiettir a."
35,"Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:","Nuhmeihaiin an mithihai tho nâwk an hmuh a, mi danghai khawm sawisakin an um a, thonâwkna ṭha nâwkzuol an chang theina dingin san suok an nuom nawh."
36,"and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:","Mi dang khawmin suknawmnat le vuokhai an tuor a, anih, chu naw khawm chu kawlbun le intângna ina khum dâm an tuok bawk a,"
37,"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated","lunga dêngin an um a, thingâtnaa ât bawngin an um a, thlêmna an tuok a, kâwlhnâma sât hlumin an um a, berâm vun le kêl vun silin an invai a; rimsitakin, rinumtakin, suknawmnatin an um a."
38,"(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.","Chuonghai ta ding chun khawvêl hi umna tlâk a ni nawh. Thlalêra dâm, tlânga dâm, pûka dâm, khura dâm an invâk an invâk hlak a."
39,"And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise,","Chun chuonghai po po chun an ringna leiin inpâk an lo hlawh a, thiltiem chu an chang nawh."
40,"God having provided some better thing concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.","Eini ṭhang lova, anni chu suk- famkima an um nawna dingin Pathienin eini kawng thuah thil ieng amanih ṭha nâwkzuol a buotsai ta leiin."
