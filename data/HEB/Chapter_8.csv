1,"Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,","Chuongchun, ei thu hrilhai laia a pawimaw tak chu hi hi a nih: Chuong ang, thiempu Laltak, vânahai khin Ropuitak lalṭhungpha chang tienga hang ṭhung chu ei nei a nih;"
2,"a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.","Hmun Inthieng le biekbûk taktak, mihriem ibâwl ni loa, Lalpa ibâwl lema rawngbâwltu chu."
3,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer.,"Thiempu Laltak taphawthai chu thilpêk le inthawinahai inhlân dinga ruot an ni sih a; chuongchun, hi Thiempu Laltak khawm hin ieng amani bêk inhlân ding nei a ngai a nih."
4,"Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;",Hnuoia hin hung um sien chu Thiempu hrim ni naw tawp a tih; Dân thu ang peia thilpêk inhlântuhai lo um sa an um leiin.
5,"who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned of God when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.","Chuonghai chun vân thilhai chu a lim le a hlim rawng an bâwl hlak a, Mosiein biekbûk a bâwl ding laia, “Tlânga enkhi ding i kuoma inentira um ang tak khan, iengkim siem dingin fimkhur rawh,” tia Pathienin a hril ang khan."
6,"But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.","Tu ruok hin chu thuthlung ṭha nâwkzuol palai a nizie ang peiin rawngbâwl sin ṭha lem a lo chang tah a, chu thuthlung chu thutiem ṭha lem chungahai siem a nih."
7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.","Chu thuthlung hmasa chu dem- na um lo lo ni sien chu, a pahnina ta ding chun hmun a zawng naw ding bah."
8,"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;","Anni demin hieng hi a hril a nih: “Ngai ta, nihai a hung tlung ding a ni tah, Lalpain a tih, Chuong niahai chun Israel sûnghai le, Juda sûnghai lai chun thuthlung thar siem ka ta,"
9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.","An thlatuhai Aigupta rama ṭhuoi suok dinga, An kuta ka chel nia, Ka thuthlung ang kha ni loin; Ka thuthlunga chun an um zing si nawh a, Chuongchun, anni chu ka ngaisak ta naw a nih, Lalpain a tih."
10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:","Chuong ni hnunga chun Israel sûnghai kuoma Thu ka thlung ding chu hieng hi a nih, Lalpain a tih; An lungrilah ka thupêkhai sieng ka ta, An lungrilah ziek bawk ka ta; Chun, anni ta dingin Pathien nîng ka ta, Keia ta dingin anni chu ka mihai ni bawk an tih:"
11,"And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.","Chun, mi tinin, ‘Lalpa chu hre rawh,’ tiin Mâni tuolbâwm le, Mâni unau inchûktir ta naw ni hai a, A chîn taka inthawkin a lien tak chenin, An rêngin an mi hriet seng ta ding leiin."
12,"For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more.","An bawsietnaahai zângai ka ta, An suolhai khawm hre zing ta naw ning,” tiin."
13,"In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.","“Thuthlung thar,” tiin a hril lei khan a hmasa chu a sukhlui tah a nih. Chuongchun, hung hluia hung upa ta chu a bo vâng vâng ta a nih."
