1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,","Chu Melkizedek chu Salem lal, Pathien Chunghnungtak Thiem- pu, Abraham lalhai thata a hung tieng lo tuoka malsâwmtu a nih."
2,"to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;","Ama chu Abrahamin iengkim sâwma pakhat a pêk a. A hming umzie chu a hmasatakah Felna Lal a na, a dawtah Salem lal a ni bawk a, chu chu Remna Lal tina a nih."
3,"without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually.","Ama chu pa nei loin, nu nei loin, chi thlatuhai chanchin nei loin, um ṭanna nei loin, hring tâwp khawm nei chuong loin, Pathien Naupa anga siema umin, Thiempuah a um zing a nih."
4,"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.","Chuongchun, chi thlatu Abra- hamin a râllâk ṭha po sâwma pakhat a ipêk chu, chu mihriem ropuizie chu ngaituo ta u."
5,"And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest’s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:","Levi thlahai laia thiempu sin chang taphawt chun Dân thu angin mihai kuoma inthawkin sâwma pakhat lâkna thu an hmu ngei a nih, chu chu an unauhaia inthawkin a nih; chuonghai chu Abraham ṭhalbea insieng ni hai sien khawm;"
6,"but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.","amiruokchu, anni laia thlatuhai sui sa ve naw khan Abrahama inthawk- in sâwma pakhat a lâk a, thutiemhai vawngtu chu mal a sâwm ta sih a."
7,But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.,"Nisienlakhawm, sêl ruol loin a chîn lem chu a lien lem malsâwm pêkin a um hlak."
8,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.","Chun, hitaka hin mihriem thi hlakhai hin sâwma pakhat an hmu hlak a, chutaka ruok chun, “a hring zing,” tia a thu an inhriettir chun a hmu a nih."
9,"And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;","Chun, Levi sâwma pakhat la hlaktu hmanin, Abraham kuta khan sâwma pakhat a pêk tah, ti thei a nih;"
10,"for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.",Melkizedekin a lo tuok lai khan a pa ṭhâlbeah a la um sih a.
11,"Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?","Chuongchun, Levihai thiempu nîna leia famkimna hmu thei a ni chun (chu hnuoia chun mihaiin Dân thu an lo hmu sih a), Aron um dân anga ruot loin, Melkizedek um dân anga thiempu dang hung um hi ieng am a ngai na?"
12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.",Thiempu nîna chu a hung danglam ta leiin Dân thu chu suk- danglam ve a hung ngai ta hrim a nih.
13,"For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.","Hieng a thu an ihril hi hnam dang mi a ni sih a, chu hnam laia mi chu tûkhawm mâichâmah an châng ngai nawh."
14,For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.,"Ei Lalpa chu Juda hnam laia inthawka hung suok a ni ti ân lang fel sih a, chu hnam thua chun Mosiein thiempuhai kawng thu iengkhawm a hril nawh."
15,"And what we say is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,","Chun, ei thu hril kha nasatakin chieng nâwkzuol a tih: Melkizedek anga thiempu dang,"
16,"who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:","tisa thupêk Dân thu anga siem mi ni lo, hring tâwp nei lo, thilthaw- theina anga siem lem mi, a hung um ding chun:"
17,"for it is witnessed of him, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.","“Nang chu Melkizedek um dân anga, Chatuon thiempu i nih ie,” ti inhriettir a ni sih a."
18,For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness,A hrât naw le a ṭhathnem nawna leiin thupêk um hmasa chu peiin a um a.
19,"(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.",Dân thu chun iengkhawm a sukfamkim si nawh. Beiseina ṭha lem lâk lûta hung um hin Pathien a mîn hnaitir lem a nih.
20,And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath,"Chun, inkhâm naw a ni naw leiin, anni chu inkhâm loa thiempua siem an ni sih a,"
21,"(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);","ama ruok chun, “ ‘Nang chu chatuona Thiempu i nih,’ tiin Lalpa ân khâm a, inkîr nâwk ta naw ni,” tia hriltu kut khan (inkhâma Thiem- pua siem a ni lem),"
22,by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.,chuong ang bawka nasa chun Isu chu thuthlung ṭha lem sukdet- puitu a hung ni tah a.
23,"And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:","Chun, anni ruok chu thi leia um sawng thei an ni naw leiin, thiempua siem an tam ngei a;"
24,"but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.",ama ruok chu chatuona a um zing leiin a Thiempu nina chu thleng thei ruol loin a nei ta lem a nih.
25,"Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.","Chuongchun, amaa Pathien kuoma hunghai chu a tâwp khâwk chenin a sandam thei bawk a nih; anni ṭawngṭai pêk dingin chatuona a hring zing leiin."
26,"For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;","Chuong ang, Thiempu Laltak, mi inthieng, sawisêlbo, inthieng naw- na kai lo, mi suolhai laia inthawka a tuma um, vânhai nêka chunghnung lema siem ta chu ei ta dingin a âwm hrim sih a."
27,"who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.","Chuong thiempu lalhai chun ni tin mâni suolna leiin inthawina an inhlân hmasa zet a, chu hnungah mihai suolna leiin an inhlân nâwk a. Chuong chu ama ta ding chun a ngai nawh, ama le ama ân hlân fâwm lai khan ṭum khatah a lo suktlingtla ta leiin."
28,"For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appointeth a Son, perfected for evermore.","Dân thu chun mihriem hrât nawna neihai chu, Thiempu Laltakah a ruot hlak a; inkhâm thu, Dân thu hnunga hung um ruok chun, Naupa chatuona dinga sukfamkim ta chu a ruot lem a nih."
