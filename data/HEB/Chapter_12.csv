1,"Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,","Chuongchun, chuong ang lâwma tam, mi thlîrtuhai in- huol vêla ei um leiin, a mi sukhnawk taphawt le suol einia kawp tlat chu sie thla vêng ei ta, ei hmaa intlânsiekna uma hin seltakin tlân pei ei tiu."
2,"looking unto Jesus the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.","Isu ei ringna siemtu le suk- famkimtu tieng chu en zingin; ama chun a hmaa hlimna um lei chun muolphona chu ngainêpin, kraws chu a tuor a, Pathien lalṭhungpha changtieng khin a hang ṭhung tah a."
3,"For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls.","In hung sâwl a, in thlarau tieng in hung chau nawna dingin, misuol- hai theidana nasatak tuormuolsuotu ngei chu ngaituo ro."
4,"Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin:","Suol doin thisen suok khawpin in la ṭhang nawh a,"
5,"and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons, My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, Nor faint when thou art reproved of him;","infuina thu, nauhai kâwk anga kâwkna cheu kha in lo theinghil tah a ni maw? “Ka nau, Lalpa thununna chu ngainêp naw la, A kâwka i umin inthlada bawk naw rawh;"
6,"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.","Lalpa chun a hmangai chu a thunun hlak a, Nau a ilâwm taphawt chu a vuok hlak i sawnnaw,” ti hi."
7,It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not?,In tuor hi nangni thununna ding a nih; nauhai chunga thaw angin Pathienin in chungah a thaw a ni hi; pa thunun naw nau tû am a um hlak a.
8,"But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.","Nau po po ihlaw hlak thununna chu hlaw loa in um chun, nau tak ni loin, sâwn in ni, a ni ding a nih."
9,"Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?","Chu naw khawm chu a mi thunun dingin ei taksa pahai ei nei kha, chuonghai chu ei inza sih a; chu nêka nasa chun, ei hringna dingin, thlarauhai Pa thu thuin ei um naw ding am a nih?"
10,"For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.","Anni chun ni sâwt nawtê ṭha an ti ang peiin an mi thunun ngei luoh a, Ama ruok chun ân thiengna chu ei chang ve theina dingin, ei ṭhatna dingin a mi thunun lem a nih."
11,"All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, even the fruit of righteousness.","Chun, thununna hrim hrim hi tuor lai chun lâwmumin ân lang nawh a, thlasietthlâkin ân lang lem hlak, tuor hnung ruok chun chutaka sawizawia umhai ta ding chun felna ra thlamuongumtak chu ân suopêk hlak."
12,"Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;","Chuongchun, kut kaithlahai chu dawm kâng unla, khûp zawihai chu sukhrât ro;"
13,"and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.","chun, kebai chu sukpelsawl loa, sukdama a um lemna dingin, in kehai ta dingin lampui tlûnhai siem ro."
14,"Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:","Mi po po le inremna le inthieng- na hnawt ro, chu inthiengna naw chun tukhawmin Lalpa hmu naw ni hai."
15,"looking carefully lest there be any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby the many be defiled;","Nguntakin en ro, chuong naw chun, Pathien lunginsietna tling zo naw mi tû amanih um a ta, khâkna zung ieng amanih hung indera suk- buoi cheuin, chu chun mi tamtak chu sukthieng loin um an ta,"
16,"lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.","indit hmang amanih, Esau anga Pathien inza naw mi amanih um rawi an tih. Ama chun a nau lutir nina chu bu vawikhat fâkin a zawr a."
17,"For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind in his father, though he sought it diligently with tears.","Chu hnunga chun malsâwmna ro chu hluo chu nuom hlein, mitthli tla pumin ṭhahnemngaitakin zawng sien khawm, simna remchâng a hmu tâk naw leiin peiin a um tah ti in hriet sih a."
18,"For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,","Nangni chu tlâng tâwk thei, meia kâng dâm, sûm dum dâm, inthim dâm, thlipui dâm umna kha tlung in ni si nawh a;"
19,"and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;","tawtawrâwt inrîkna dâm, thu hril ri umna dâm kha, chu ri hretuhai chun thu dang hrim an kuoma hril ta lo dingin an ngên a,"
20,"for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;","“Sa chen khawmin tlâng chu tâwk sienla, lunga dêng hlumin a um ding a nih,” ti thupêk kha an tuor thei ta si nawh a;"
21,"and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:","an thil hmu khawm chu ṭi a um êm a, chuongchun, Mosiein, “Ka ṭiin kân thin nasa bêk bêk a,” a ti kha."
22,"but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,","Zion tlâng dâm, Pathien hring khuo, vân Jerusalem dâm, tiem sêng nawhai vântirko inkhâwmpui dâm,"
23,"to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,","nau lutîr vâna hming chuong kohran kuom dâm, Pathien, mi po po ngaituotu kuom dâm, mi fel sukṭhat famkimhai thlarau kuom dâm,"
24,"and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of Abel.","Isu thuthlung thar palai kuom dâm, thisen the, Abel thisen nêka ṭha lem hriltu kuom dâm tlung in ni lem."
25,"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned them on earth, much more shall not we escape who turn away from him that warneth from heaven:","Thu hriltu chu lo dit naw rawi in tih, fimkhur ro. Hnuoia anni kâwk hmasatu kha an dit naw hmana, hremna an pumpel si naw chun, eini vâna inthawka mi kâwktu nghatsan- tuhai hin pumpel naw nâwkzuol ei tih."
26,"whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.","Chu lai chun a râwl chun hnuoi hi a sukhnîng a, nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu, “Vawi khat chu hnuoi chau ni loin, vân khawm la sukhnîng ka tih,” tiin a tiem ta lem a."
27,"And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.","Chun, “Vawi khat la sukhnîng nâwk ka tih,” ti hin thil inhnîng nawhai chu a um zing theina dingin thil hung inhnînghai chu thil siemhai ang elin sawn hmangin a um ding a nih ti ân hriettir a."
28,"Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:","Chuongchun, ram sukhnîng ruol lo ei chang leiin, lâwmtakin um ei tiu, chu zâra chun inza le ṭidêk pumin Pathien lâwm zâwngin rawng ei bâwl thei ding a nih;"
29,for our God is a consuming fire.,ei Pathien hi mi kâng bohmang mei a ni sih a.
