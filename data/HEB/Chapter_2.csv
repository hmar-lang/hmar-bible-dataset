verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away from them.","Chuleiin, naa ei ihriethai kha ṭhahnemngaitakin ei pawisa nâwkzuol ding a nih, chuong naw chun, intawl hmang hlau rawi ei tih."
2,"For if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;","Vântirkohai hmanga thu hril hman kha a lo det a, bâwsietna le thuâwi nawna tinrênghai chun thungna feltak a hmu pei si chun,"
3,"how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard;","hieng ang lâwma sandamna ropui hi inthlathlam inla, iengtin am tlân suok thei hlak ei ta? Chu Sandamna thu chu Lalpa hmanga a tîra hril a ni tah a, a hretuhai chun an mi sukdet pêk pei a."
4,"God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.","Pathien khawmin inchiknahai le thilmakhai le, thilthawtheina tin- rênghai le, ama dit zâwng ang peia Thlarau Inthieng thil semhai le chun, anni chu a hrietpui a."
5,"For not unto angels did he subject the world to come, whereof we speak.","Khawvêl la hung um ding, a chanchin ei hril chu vântirkohai hnuoia chu a sie nawh,"
6,"But one hath somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?","Nisienlakhawm, mi tu amani chun khâwlai âm ani chu hieng thu hi inhriettirin a hril ta lem a: “Mihriem hi ieng am a nih a, i hriet zing hlak a na? Mihriem naupa khawm hi ieng am a nih a, i kan hlak a na?"
7,"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; Thou crownedst him with glory and honor, And didst set him over the works of thy hands:","Ama chu vântirkohai nêka inhnuoiin i siem hrih a, Ropuina le chawimawina în khumtir a, I kutsuok chungahai chun hotuah i siem bawk a;"
8,"Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.","“A ke hnuoiah iengkim i sieh a,” tiin. Chuongchun, a hnuoiah iengkim a sie leiin a hnuoia sie naw ieng- khawm a nei nawh. Amiruokchu, tuhin chu iengkim a hnuoiah umin ei la hmu hri nawh."
9,"But we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for every man.","Nisienlakhawm, Isu vântirkohai nêka inhnuoia siema la um hri chu thina tuor leia ropuina le chawi- mawina inkhumtira umin ei hmu ta lem a nih; Pathien lunginsietna leia thîna chu mi tin ân tempêkna dingin."
10,"For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.","A ta dinga iengkim uma, a zâra iengkim um bawk ta ding chun, nau tamtak ropuinaa a ṭhuoi lût chun, an sandamna siemtu kha tuornahai leiin sukfamkim chu a âwm hrim sih a."
11,"For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,","A sukthiengtu le a isukthieng- hai chu an rêngin Mi pakhata suok an ni sih a; chuleiin, ama chun anni rawi chu “Unauhai,” ti ân zak nawh a:"
12,"saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise.","“Ka unauhai lai i hming hril ka ta, Um khâwmhai laia chun, Hla sakin inpâk ka ti che,” tiin."
13,"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me.","Chun, “Amaah ka ringna innghat ka tih,” a ti nâwk a. Chun, “En ta u, kei le, Pathien mi pêk naupanghai hi,” a ti nâwk bawk a."
14,"Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;","Chuongchun, naupanghai hi tisa le thisen changtuhai an ni tâwl leiin, ama ngei khawmin chuong bawk chu a chang ve tah a; thînain thîna thuneitu (chu chu Diebol a nih), a sukbohmang theina ding le,"
15,and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.,thîna ṭi leia dam sûnga suoka um po pohai chu a sansuok theina dingin.
16,"For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham.","A iṭhangpui hlakhai chu vântir- kohai an ni dêr si nawh a, Abraham thlahai an nih a iṭhangpui hlak chu."
17,"Wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.","Chuongchun, mihai ta dingin suol thuphachawina siempêk dingin, Pathien tieng thilhaia chun, Thiem- pu Laltak, mi lâinatthei le ringum tak a ni theina dingin, iengkima a unauhai anga hung um chu a ṭûl hrim a nih."
18,"For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.","Ama ngei chun thlêmna tuokin a lo tuor ta leiin, thlêmna tuokhai chu a ṭhangpui thei a nih."
