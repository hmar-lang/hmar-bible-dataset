1,"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus;","Chuongchun, unau inthieng vân kona chang vehai, ei thuringa Tirko le Thiempu Laltak, Isu chu ngaituo ro;"
2,"who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.","Pathien sûnghai po po laiah Mosie ring a um ang bawk khan, ama chu a ruottu kuoma chun ring a um a nih."
3,"For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.","Sûng khata a puipa chu a sûnghai nêkin an chawimawi ang ngeiin, ama chu Mosie nêkin ropui nâwk zuolna hmu tlâka ruot a ni sih a."
4,For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.,"Sûng tin hin a puipa tu amanih bêk an nei seng hlak sih a, iengkima a puipa ruok chu Pathien a nih."
5,"And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;","Chun, chu hnunga thu la hril dinghai inhriettirna dingin, Mosie chu Pathien sûnghai po po laia rawngbâwltua chun ring a um ngei a;"
6,"but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.","Krista ruok chu Pathien sûnghai chungah Naupaah ring a um a nih. A sûnghai chu eini hi ei nih, a tâwp chenin ei huoina le, ei beiseina suongum hi dettaka ei chel phawt chun."
7,"Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice,","Chuongchun, Thlarau Inthieng hril ang bawkin:— “Vawisûn hin a râwl in hriet chun,"
8,"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,","Thlalêra thlêmna nia, An suknuor lai ang khan, In lungril sukngar naw ro;"
9,"Where your fathers tried me by proving me, And saw my works forty years.","Chutaka chun in thlâtuhai chun An mi fiein an mi thlêm a, Kum sâwmli sûnga Ka thilthawhai an hmuh a;"
10,"Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do always err in their heart: But they did not know my ways;","Chuongchun, chu thlâhai chunga chun ka lungni nawh a, ‘An lungrilin an ngai suol rawp hlak a, Ka lampuihai khawm an hriet nawh,’ ka tih a,"
11,"As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.","Ka lungsena kân khâm ang khan, Ka châwlnaa chun lût naw nihai,” tiin."
12,"Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:","Unauhai, fimkhur ro, chuong naw chun, Pathien hring chu bânsan dingin nangni laiah tu sûnga khawm awi nawna lungril suol hung um rawi a tih."
13,"but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:","“Vawisûn,” an ti sûng hin ni tinin infui tuo lem ro; chuong naw chun, nangni laia mi tûkhawm hi suol hlêmnaa sukngarin um rawi in tih."
14,"for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:","Krista changtuhai ei lo ni ta sih a, ei ring san phutna kha a tâwp chena dettaka ei chel tlat phawt chun,"
15,"while it is said, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.","“Vawisûn hin a râwl in hriet chun, An suknuor lai ang khan, In lungril sukngar naw ro,” an ti sûng po hin."
16,"For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?","Anleh, tuhai am an na hre zing sia suknuor kha? Aigupta rama inthawka Mosie ṭhuoia suok po pohai kha an ni naw am a nih?"
17,"And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?","Chun, tuhai chung âm a na kum sâwmli sûng a lungni naw kha? Suksuoltu, an ruong thlalêra tlu tahai chunga khan a ni naw am a nih?"
18,"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?","Chun, thuawi nawhai kuoma chau naw chun tu kuom âm a châwlnaa lût naw dingin inkhâmin a tiem a?"
19,And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.,"Chuongchun, ring nâwna leiin an lût thei ta nawh ti ei hriet a nih."
