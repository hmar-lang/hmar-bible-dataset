1,"God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,","Pathien inhmaa thlatuhai kuoma bung tamtak le kawng tinrênga zâwlneihaia thu lo hriltu khan,"
2,"hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds;","hieng ni tâwpa hin eini kuomah a Naupaa chun thu a hril tah. Ama chu iengkim rohluotu dingin a ruot a, amaa bawk chun khawvêlhai chu a siem a."
3,"who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;","Ama chu a Pathien ropuina var le, a tak angpui ngei leh, ama thil- thawtheina thuah iengkim tungding- tu niin, suolhai a sukthieng hnungin chung tienga Ropuitak changtienga khin a hang ṭhung a."
4,"having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.",Vântirkohai nêka hming ṭha lem ro a hluo sâwng ang ngeiin anni nêka ropui lem a hung ni ta sih a.
5,"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be to him a Father, And he shall be to me a Son?","Vântirko hai laia tu kuom am hi thu hi a hril hlak a? “Nang chu ka Naupa i nih, Vawisûn hin ka nei che a nih,” ti le, “A ta dingin Pa ning ka ta, Ama chu keia ta dingin Naupa ning a tih,” ti hi."
6,"And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.","Chun, Nau lutir chu khawvêla hin a ṭhuoi lût nâwkin, “Pathien vântirkohai po po khawmin, Ama chibai bûk raw se,” a tih a."
7,"And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels winds, And his ministers a flame of fire:","Chun, vântirko chungchâng thua chun hi hi a hril a nih: “Ama chun a vântirkohai chu, Thliah ân changtir hlak a, A rawngbâwltuhai khawm, Meichawkah ân changtir hlak,” ti hi."
8,"but of the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.","Naupa chungchâng thua ruok chu hi hi a hril a nih: “Aw Pathien, i lalṭhungpha chu Chatuonin a um ding a nih; Indikna lal hmawl khawm chu, I ram lal hmawl chu a nih."
9,"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.","Felna chu i ngaina a, Bawsietna chu i theida kha; Chuleiin, Pathien, i Pathien chun, I ruolhai nêk chun, Hlimna hriek a nâl nasa lem che hi,” ti le,"
10,"And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the works of thy hands:","“Nang Lalpa, a tîrin, Leilung innghatsan i phûm tah a, Vânhai khawm i kutsuok a na,"
11,They shall perish; but thou continuest: And they all shall wax old as doth a garment;,"Chuonghai chu la bohmang a ta, Nang ruok chu um sawng ding i nih; Chun, chuonghai po po chu, Silfên angin la hlui a ta,"
12,"And as a mantle shalt thou roll them up, As a garment, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, And thy years shall not fail.","Puon angin zuol bawk i ta– Silfên ang elin, Chuongchun, hung danglam tâng a ta; Nang ruok chu i pângngai rawp a, I kumhai khawm bo naw ni,” tiin."
13,"But of which of the angels hath he said at any time, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?","Nisienlakhawm, vântirkohai laia tu chungchâng thu âm hi hi a hril hlak a? “Ka changtieng ṭhung rawh, I hmêlmahai i kepha sirsana, Ka siem hmakhat chun,” ti hi."
14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?","Anni po po chu rawngbâwlna thlarauhai, sandamna rohluotu ding- hai ta dinga rawngbâwl dinga tirsuok an ni naw am a nih?"
