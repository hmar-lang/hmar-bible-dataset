1,"For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.","Dân thu chun thil ṭha hung um dinghai angpui nei loin, a hlim chau a nei leiin, kum tina inthâwina pângngai an inhlân rawphai chun, a hung hnaihai chu iengtika khawm sukfamkim thei si naw ni a."
2,"Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.","Chuong chu ni naw sien chu a betuhai chu vawi khata sukthieng nghâla umin suolhai inhrietna nei ta naw nihai a, inhlân chu an ma dai ta naw ding am a nih?"
3,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.,"Nisienlakhawm, chuong inthâwi- naa chun kum tinin suolhai hriet nâwkna a hung um rawp lem a nih."
4,For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.,Bâwngchalhai le kêlhai thisen chun suolhai sukbo thei ruol a ni si nawh a.
5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me;","Chuongchun, khawvêla a hung lût laiin: “Inthawina le thil inhlân i dit nawh a, Ka ta dingin taksa i mi buotsai pêk lem a;"
6,In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure:,"Pumrâwhmanga inthâwinahaia le, Suol ta dinga inthâwinahaia chun Lâwmna hrim i nei nawh."
7,"Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me) To do thy will, O God.","Chu phingle chun keiin, ‘Aw Pathien, ngai ta, (Lekhabu zuola chun ka thu ziek a nih), I dit zâwng thaw dingin ka hung,’ ka tih a,” a ta,"
8,"Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),","A saka khin, “Inthawina dâm, thil inhlân dâm, pumrâwhmanga inthâwina dâm, suol ta dinga in- thâwina dâm i dit nawh a, chuonga chun lâwmna i nei bawk nawh,” a tih a. (Chuonghai chu dân thu anga inhlân a nih)."
9,"then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.","Chu phingle chun, “Ngai ta, I dit zâwng thaw dingin ka hung,” a lo ti tah a. A pahnina hi ân tungding theina dingin a hmasa chu a sukbo ta a nih."
10,By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.,"Chu chu dit zâwng chun, Isu Krista taksa vawi khata hlân nghâl lei khan sukthiengin ei um tah."
11,"And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:","Chun, thiempu tinrêngin kâwla nisa suok tiema rawng bâwlin suolhai iengtik lai khawma sukbo thei naw inthâwina pângngai inhlân rawpin an ngîr hlak;"
12,"but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;","ama ruok hi chu, chatuona dingin suolhai ta dinga inthâwina ṭum khat chau ân hlân hnungin, Pathien changtieng a hang ṭhung ta lem a."
13,henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.,"Chu chena inthawk chu, a hmêlmahai a kepha innghatnaa siem an ni hmakhat chu a nghâk zing a."
14,For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.,Thil inhlân ṭum khat chauin sukthieng tahai chu chatuona dingin a sukfamkim ta sih a.
15,"And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,","Chun, Thlarau Inthieng khawm chun a mîn hriettir bawk a:"
16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them; then saith he,","“Chuong ni hnunga chun, An kuoma thu ka thlung dinghai chu hieng hi a nih, Lalpain a tih, An lungrilah ka thupêkhai sieng ka ta, An lungrilah ziek bawk ka tih,” tia a hril hnung khan;"
17,And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.,"“An suolhai le an bâwsietnahai Hre zing ta naw ning,” a ti sih a."
18,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.","Chuongchun, chuong ang ngai- damna taphawta chun suol ta dingin thil inhlân a um ta naw a nih."
19,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,","Chuongchun, unauhai, Isu thi- sen lei chun, Hmun Inthienga khan lût ei huom a;"
20,"by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;","Puonzâr (a taksa) chu fe thlengin, lam thar le hring a mi hawng pêk tah a;"
21,and having a great priest over the house of God;,"Chuongchun, Pathien sûnghai chunga Thiempu ropuitak ei nei leiin,"
22,"let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,","ei lungrila sie le ṭha hrietna faitaka umin, ei taksa khawm tui inthienga sâwpa umin, ringna fam- kim neia lungril indiktak putin hnai ei tiu."
23,let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:,Inhnîng lovin ei beisei thuring hi pawm tlat ei tiu; thutiemtu chu ring a um sih a.
24,and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;,"Chun, hmangai le thilthawa in- chawktho tuo dingin inngaituo seng ei tiu."
25,"not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.","Ṭhenkhat thaw dân anga in- khâwm dâm bânsan loin, infui tuo lem ei tiu, ni chu hung hnai deu deua in hrietin infui tuo nâwkzuol sau ro."
26,"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,","Thutak hrietna famkim chu ei chang hnunga thil ei suksuol ṭâl chun, suolhai dingin inthâwina um ta dêr naw ni a,"
27,"but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.",rorêlna ṭi lâwkna râpthlâktak ieng amani leh dotuhai kâng hmang dinga lungsenna mei chu um lem tâng a tih.
28,A man that hath set at nought Moses’ law dieth without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses:,"Mosie Dân thu pawisa naw mi chu, hretu pahni pathum amani thuin lainatna ṭhang loin an thi hlak."
29,"of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?","Pathien Naupa sirde a, thu- thlung thisen ama sukthiengna thil narâna ruota, lunginsietna Thlarau suknuortu chu, chu mi chu ieng anga hremna nasa lem tuor tlâka ruot ni dingin am in ngai a?"
30,"For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.","“Phuba hrim hrim keia lâk ding a nih, keiin thung ka tih,” ti le “Lalpa chun a mihai ngaituong a tih,” ti nâwktu chu ei hriet si a."
31,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.,Pathien hring kuta tlûk chu thil râpthlâktak a nih.
32,"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;","Nisienlakhawm, inhmaa suk- vara in um hnunga tuorna buoi nasatak in tuor lai nihai kha hre nâwk ro:"
33,"partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.","kawng khata chun hmusit le rinumhai khawm tuorin ennuoma siemin in um a, kawng khata chun chuong anga inhmaa lo umhai kha tuorpuituhai in hung nih."
34,"For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.","Kawlbunhai chu in lainat a, thil ṭha lem, um sawng bawk ding chu, mâniin in nei ti hrein, in thilneihai lâkpêka in umnaa khawm lâwmtakin in lo tuor tah a."
35,"Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.","Chuongchun, in ringna lâwm- man pêk nasatak nei ding chu peihâwn naw ro,"
36,"For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.",Pathien dit zâwng in thaw hnungin thiltiem chu in hmu theina dingin selna in ngai a nih.
37,"For yet a very little while, He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.","“Sawt nawtê hnungah, A hung ding chu a hung ding a ni sih a. Sâwt riel ta naw nih."
38,"But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.","Nisienlakhawm, ka mi fel chu Ringnain hring a tih; A hnungtawl ruok chun, Ka lungrilin amaa chun lâwmna hrim nei naw ni,”"
39,But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.,"Nisienlakhawm, eini chu bo- hmang dinga hnungtawl pâwla mi ei ni nawh a, hringna humhim dinga ringna nei pâwla mi ei ni lem."
