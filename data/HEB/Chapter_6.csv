1,"Wherefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,","Chuongchun, Krista thu bul hril ta loin puitling tieng pan ei tiu; lungphûm chu phûm nâwk ta loin– simna dâm, Pathien tienga ringna dâm,"
2,"of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.","baptismahai le, kut innghat le, mithi thonâwkna le, chatuona rorêl- na kawng thu inchûktirna lungphûm chu."
3,"And this will we do, if God permit.",Pathienin rem a ti chun chu chu thaw ngei ei tih.
4,"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,","Chun, vawikhat lungril sukvara, vân thilpêk intema, Thlarau Inthieng inchangtira,"
5,"and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,","Pathien thu ṭha le hun la hung um dinga thilthawtheina intem ta zeta,"
6,"and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.","tlûksanhai kawng thu chu — chuong mihai chu an simna dingin siem thar nâwk ruol an ni nawh, Pathien Naupa chu anni ta dinga hemde nâwka sukmuolpho an ni leiin."
7,"For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:","Hnuoi, a chunga ruotui tla rawp lo dâwn taa, thloa a umna sanhai ta dinga thlai fâk tlâk hung insuotu chun, Pathiena inthawkin malsâwm- na a hmu hlak a nih."
8,"but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.","Amiruokchu, hlohlingnei le buor- hai ân suo chun mâkin a hung um a, ṭawngsephur hielin a um hlak a, a tâwpa chun raw a tuok hlak."
9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak:","Nisienlakhawm, dittakhai, chuong ang chun hril inlang khawm, nangni chun, thil ṭha lem sandamnaa ṭhang thilhai chu in thaw kan ring tlat cheu a nih."
10,"for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.","In sin thaw le a hming leia hmangaina in inlangtir, mi inthieng- hai rawng in ibâwl, tu chen khawma in ila bâwl rawp chu theinghil dingin Pathien chu mi fel naw a ni si nawh a."
11,And we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end:,"Chun, in beiseina chu a fam- kima hmu dingin a tâwp chenin in ṭhahnemngaina pângngai insuo pei unla kan ti bêk bêk a nih."
12,"that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.","Chuongchun, inthlada naw ti niu a, ringna le nghâk peina leia thutiemhai ro hluotahai inchûk tuhai ni lem in tih."
13,"For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,","Pathienin Abraham kuoma thu a hung tiem lai khan, ama nêka ropui lem sâlin ân khâm thei naw leiin ama le ama insâlin,"
14,"saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.","“Matheiloin, mal sâwm ngei ngei ka ti che a, pung khawm suk pung pêk ngei ngei ka ti che,” tiin ân khâm tah a."
15,"And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.","Chuongchun, seltaka a tuor suok hnungin thiltiem chu a hmu ta ngei a."
16,For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.,"Mihriem hin anni nêka ropui lem sâlin an inkhâm hlak a nih, an insêlna tinrênga khawm sukdetna dingin inkhâm hi suktâwpna a ni hlak a."
17,"Wherein God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;","Chuongchun, Pathienin thu- tiem rohluo dinghai kuoma chun a rêl danglam thei nawzie, nasa nâwk zuola inentir nuomin inkhâmin a sukdet a;"
18,"that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:","Pathien inkhêl ruol a ni nawna, thil danglam thei naw pahni leiin, eini, insanhimna dinga ei hmaa beiseina um chel dinga tlânhai in- fuina nasatak ei nei theina dingin."
19,"which we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;","Chu beiseina chu hringnaa thîr- chakaiah ei nei a, ringum le dettak a nih, puonzâr sûnga mia khawm chun a lût a,"
20,"whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.","chutaka chun Isu, Melkizedek um dân anga chatuon Thiempu Laltak lo ni tain, ei hmaṭhuoitu dingin a lût tah a."
