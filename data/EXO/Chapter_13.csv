1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","Chun LALPA chun Mosie kuomah a hril a,"
2,"Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.","“Israel thlahai laia nau lutîr sul hung kêu taphawt, mihriem khawm, ran khawm ka kuomah hung inhlân vawng rawh: ka ta a nih,” tiin."
3,"And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.","Mosie chun mipui kuoma chun, “Suoka in umna Aiguptaa inthawk in hung suok ni kha hre zing ro: LALPAIN kut thahrâtin chu hmuna inthawk chu a hung ṭhuoi suok cheu a ni kha; chawl ṭhang bei hrim fâk a ni ding a ni nawh."
4,This day ye go forth in the month Abib.,"Abib thla, hi ni hin in fe suok a ni hi."
5,"And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.","LALPAIN Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Amor mihai, Hiv mihai le Jebus mihai ram, in thlatuhai kuoma pêk ding cheua a itiem, khuoizu le nênetuia luong rama a ṭhuoi lût pha cheu chun hi thlaa bawk hin hi rawngbâwlna hunbi hi in hmang ding a nih."
6,"Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Jehovah.","Ni sari sûng chawl ṭhanglo bei fâng in ta, a ni sari ni chun LALPA kuomah ruoi ṭhêng in tih."
7,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders.","Ni sari sûng chu chawl ṭhang- lo bei fâk ding a nih a; chun, in kuoma hrim hrim chawl ṭhang bei hmu a ni ding a ni nawh a, in ram sûng po po le nangni kuoma khawm chawl hrim hrim hmu a ni ding a ni nawh."
8,"And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.","Chu ni chun i naupa kuomah, ‘Aiguptaa inthawka ka hung suok laia LALPA thil mi thawpêk ta leia thaw a nih,’ tiin hril i tih."
9,"And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.","Chun, LALPA Dân chu i baua a um theina dingin, i mithai kâra hriet zingna ding le, i kuthai chunga nangma ta dinga inchikna dingin nîng a tih; LALPA chun kut thahrâtin Aiguptaa inthawkin a ṭhuoi suok ta si cheh a."
10,Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.,"Chuleiin, kum tinin hi hi a hun peiah dân angin i hmang ding a nih.”"
11,"And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,","Chun i thlatuhai le nanga kuoma a tiem ta anga Kanaan mihai ramah LALPAIN a ṭhuoi lût cheh a, ram chu a pêk pha che chun,"
12,"that thou shalt set apart unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be Jehovah’s.",sul hung keu hmasa tak taphawt chu LALPA ta bîk dingin sie tum i tih. I ran nei tê hmasa tak po po a chal taphawt chu LALPA ta nîng a tih.
13,"And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem.",Sabengtung tê hmasa tak chu berâmtein intlan i tih; în tlan naw ding chun a rîng chu her bawng i tih. I naupasalhai lai khawm nau lutîr po po chu intlan i tih.
14,"And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:","Chun, nakie hun la hung tlung dinga khawm i naupain, Hi hi a umzie ieng am a na? tiha ân dawn che chun, a kuomah hieng hin hril i tih, “Suoka umna ram Aiguptaa inthawk LALPAIN kut thahrâtin a mi ṭhuoi suok tah a."
15,"and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem.","Pharao chun lulul suoin mîn suoktir naw ṭâl sien khawm, LALPA chun Aigupta rama nau lutîr po po: mihriem le ran tê a pieng hmasa tak po po chu a sukhlum ta vawng a. Chuleiin, sul hung kêutu hmasa tak a chal taphawt chu LALPA kuomah kân hlân a, ka naupasalhai nau lutîr taphawt ruok chu ân tlanin kân tlan a nih."
16,"And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.","Chun, i mithai kâra thilkhim ding le i kut chunga inchikna dingin nîng a tih; LALPA chun kut thahrât chun Aigupta rama inthawkin a ṭhuoi suok ta si cheh a, tiin,” a tih a."
17,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:","Pharaoin mipui chu ân suoktir phing chun, Pathienin, “An fenaa hin indona an va hmu pha mipui chu insîr an ta, Aiguptaa chun kîr nâwk rawi an tih,” a ti leiin a lam chu hnai sien khawm Philistin mihai ram fe thlengna lam tieng chun Pathienin anni chu a ṭhuoi nawh a."
18,"but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.","Tuipui sen tieng, thlalêr tienga lam inhêl zâwng chun mipui chu Pathienin a ṭhuoi ta lem a, Israel thlahai chu râlthuom kim leh Aigupta rama inthawk chun an suok tah a."
19,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.","Mosie chun Josef ruhai chu a chawi pei a, Israel thlahai chu, “Pathienin hung kan ngei ngei a ti cheu a, chun in fena taphawtah ka ru khawm sawm pei in tih,” tiin a lo tiem ta hrim a."
20,"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.","Sukkotha inthawkin an fe suok a, thlalêr sîr Ethama chun bûk an khuor tah a."
21,"And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; that they might go by day and by night:","Zâna le sûna khawm an fe theina dingin, LALPA chu sûnah sûm ngîrin an hma ṭhuoi dingin le zânah mei ngîrin anni var pe dingin, an hmaah a fe pei a;"
22,"the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people.",sûna sûm ngîr le zâna mei ngîr chu mipui hmaha inthawk chun ân kieng ngai hrim hrim nawh a.
