1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah,"
2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.","“Israel thlahai kuomah hril la, ‘Kîr nâwk hai sienla, Pi-hahiroth phâk hma, Migdol le tuipui inkâr, tuipui kâwl, Baalzephon hma zawn, a ep chieha chun riebûk bawl raw hai se."
3,"And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.","Chuongchun, Pharaoin Israel thlahai chu, “Rampalailakah an inhmanga thlalêrin anni a khârkhum an tah,” tîng a tih."
4,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host: and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.","Chun, Pharao lungril chu suk- ngar ka ta, anni chu hung hnawtzui a tih; chun, Pharao le a sipaihai chungah ropuina chang ka tih: chun, Aigupta mihai chun LALPA ka ni mi hre tâng an tih,’ tiin,” a tih a. Chuong ang tak chun an thaw tah a."
5,"And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?","Mipui chu an tlân suok tah ti Aigupta lal chu hrila a um chun, mipui chungthua Pharao le a siehlawhai lungril chu ân let ta thut a, “Hi thil ei thaw hi ieng am a nih a, Israel mihai ei rawng an bâwlnaa inthawk ei insuoktir el hi?” an tih a."
6,"And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:","Pharao chun a sakawr tawlai- lîrhai chu a siemrêl a, a mihai chu a ṭhuoi a,"
7,"and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.","Aiguptaa sakawr tawlailîr po po le, sakawr tawlailîr thlang ṭhieu za ruk, an chunga sipai hotu seng leh a ṭhuoi a."
8,"And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.","Chun, LALPA chun Aigupta lal Pharao lungril chu a sukngar a, Israel thlahai chu a hnawt zui tah a; Israel thlahai chu muongchara suok an ni sih a."
9,"And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.","Aigupta mihai chun an hnungah an hnawt tah a, Pharao sakawr tawlailîr le sakawr po po le, a sakawr chung chuong mihai le, a sipai ruol le chun; chuongchun, Baalzephon ep, Pi-hahiroth sîr, tuipui kâwla an riebûk bâwlnaa chun an hnawt phâk tah a."
10,"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.","Pharao chu a hung hnai chun Israel thlahai chun an hang en a, an hnunga Aigupta mihai hung ṭhuop ṭhuop chu an hang hmuh a, nasa- takin an ṭih a, Israel thlahai chun LALPA chu an ko tah a."
11,"And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?","Mosie kuomah, “Aiguptaah thlânhai a um naw leiin a ni maw thlalêra thi dinga i mi ṭhuoi suok hi? Aiguptaa inthawk mi ṭhuoi suok a i thilthaw dân hi iengtizie am a na?"
12,"Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.","Aiguptaa khawm Aigupta mihai rawng kan bâwl theina dingin mi tosan el rawh, ‘Thlalêra kan thi hmang nêk chun Aigupta mihai rawng hi bâwl inlang kan ta dingin a ṭha lem sih a,’ tiha i kuoma kan hril kha hi hi a ni ta ngei ni lo am a nih?” an tih a."
13,"And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.","Mosie chun mipui kuoma chun, “Ngîr ṭawk ṭawk unla, ṭi naw ro, LALPA sandamna, in ta dinga vawisûn a thaw ding chu en el ro; vawisûna Aigupta mi in hmuhai hi kumkhuoin in hmu nâwk ta naw ding a ni sih a."
14,"Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.","LALPA chun in ta dingin do a ta, nangni ruok chu in um ṭawk ṭawk ding a nih,” a tih a."
15,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Iengdinga i mi ko am a na? Israel thlahai kuomah hril la, hmatieng fe pei raw hai se."
16,"And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.","I hmawl kha chawi sâng la, i kut kha tuipui chungah phar suok la, tuipui chu ṭhe rawh, Israel thlahai chu tuipui inkâra chun hnuoi hula an fe theina dingin."
17,"And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.","Chun, keiin Aigupta mihai lungril sukngar ka ta, an hnungah hung lût vêng an tih; chun, Pharao le a sipai ruol po po, a sakawr tawlailîr po po le, a sakawr chung chuong mihai chungah ropuina chang ka tih."
18,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.","Aigupta mihai chun Pharao le a sakawr tawlailîrhai le a sakawr chung chuong mihai chunga ropuina ka chang pha chun LALPA ka nih ti hre tâng an tih,” a tih a."
19,"And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:","Chun, LALPA vântirko Israel- hai bûk hmaha fe chu ân tâwl a, an hnungah a fe tah a: chun, sûm ngîr chu an hmaha inthawkin ân tâwl a, an hnungah a ngîr a:"
20,"and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other all the night.","Israel mihai le Aigupta mihai riebûk inkâra chun a hung a. Chuongchun, sûm le inthim chu a um a, zân chu sûm chun a sukvar hlau thung a, zânkhuoin tu tu khawm an inhnai tuo nawh a."
21,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.","Chun, Mosiein tuipui chunga chun a kut a phar a, chun LALPAIN sak thli hrâttak zânkhawvâra hrâng- in tuipui chu ân luong kîrtir a, tuipui chu ram ṭâwlah a siem a, tuihai chu an inṭhe tah a."
22,"And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.",Israel thlahai chu tuipui inkâra chun hnuoi hulah an fe tah a; tuihai chu an changtieng le vawitieng bang angin a um a.
23,"And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.","Aigupta mihai chun an hnawt pei a, Pharao sakawrhai, a sakawr tawlailîrhai le, a sakawr chung chuong mihai po po chu an hnunga chun tuipui inkâra chun an lût veh a."
24,"And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.","Zîngtieng vêng hunah LALPA chun Aigupta sipai ruol chu mei ngîr le sûma chun a zuk en a, Aigupta sipai ruol chu a sukbuoi tah a."
25,"And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah fighteth for them against the Egyptians.","An sakawr tawlailîr kekuolhai chu a sukthlawngpêk a, intaktakin an khal tah a; chuongchun, Aigupta mihai chun, “Israelhai hmaha in- thawkin tlân el ei tiu, LALPA chun an ta dingin Aigupta mihai chu a dopêk a ni hi,” an tih a."
26,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Tuipui chungah i kut kha phar rawh, Aigupta mihai le, an sakawr tawlailîrhai le, an sakawr chung chuong mihai chungah tui chu a hung luongna dingin,” a tih a."
27,"And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.","Mosie chun tuipui chunga chun a kut chu a phar a, zîngkâr a hung ni chun tuipui chu a luong hrât pângngaiin a luong nâwk tah a; Aigupta mihai chu an tlânsieh a, LALPA chun Aigupta mihai chu tuipuia chun a peilût tah a."
28,"And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them.","Tui chu a kîr nâwk a, sakawr tawlailîrhai, sakawr chung chuong mihai le, Pharao sipai ruol, an hnunga hung hnawttuhai ngei chu ân khum ta vawng a, pakhat khawm hlain an um ta nawh a."
29,"But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.","Israel thlahai ruok chu tuipui kâra chun hnuoi hulah an feh a, tui chu an changtieng le vawitieng chun bang angin a umpêk a."
30,Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.,"Chu ni chun LALPAIN Israel- hai chu Aigupta mihai kuta inthawk- in a sanhim tah a, vadung pang sîr vêla Aigupta mi thihai chu Israelhai chun an hmuh a."
31,"And Israel saw the great work which Jehovah did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared Jehovah: and they believed in Jehovah, and in his servant Moses.","Israelhai chun Aigupta mihai chunga LALPAIN thil ropuitak a thaw chu an hmuh a, mipui chun LALPA chu an ṭi tah a; LALPA le a siehlaw Mosie chu an ring tah a."
