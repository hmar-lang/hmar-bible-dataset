1,"And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.","Mipui chun Mosie chu tlânga inthawk chun a hung thla intak hle ti an hmu chun anni mipui chu Aron kuomah an hung inkhâwm a, a kuomah, “Tho la, kan hma ṭhuoitu dingin pathienhai mi siem- pêk rawh: hi Mosie Aigupta rama inthawka mi ṭhuoi suoktu hlak hi ieng am a chang a ni tah kan hriet si nawh a,” an tih a."
2,"And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.","Aron chun an kuomah, “Rângka- chak kutsebihai in nuhmeihai le in naupasalhai le in naunuhmeihai nakâwra an bêhai chu hlîp thla unla, ka kuomah hung la ro,” a tih a."
3,"And all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.","Chun, mipui po po chun an nakâwrhaia rângkachak nabêhai chu an hlîp a, Aron kuoma chun an hung lâk a."
4,"And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.","An kuta inthawk chun a lâk a, kerna hriemhrei hmangin a sungna ding a siem a, bâwngte limah a sung tah a. Anni chun, “Aw Israel, hi hi Aigupta rama inthawka hung ṭhuoi suoktu che i pathien chu a ni hi,” an tih a."
5,"And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.","Aronin chu chu a hmu chun, bâwngte hmaa chun mâichâm a siem a, “Zînga chu LALPA kuoma ruoi- ṭhena um a tih,” tiin thu a puong tah a."
6,"And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.","A zînga chun inhmatakin an tho a, pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu an inhlân a, inremna thilinhlânhai chu an hung lâk tah a: chuongchun, mipui chu fa ding le dâwn dingin an ṭhung a, inhnel dingin an tho tah a."
7,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah a hril a, “Inhmaw la, fe thla rawh, i mihai Aigupta rama i ṭhuoi suokhai khan anni le anni an insuksiet ta sih a:"
8,"they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.","an kuoma thu ka pêka inthawk chun an pêt hmang nghâl el tah a; bâwngte lim sung an insiemfâwm a, an biek a, a kuomah an inthâwi a, ‘Aw Israel, Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu che i pathien a ni hi,’ an tih a,” tiin."
9,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:","LALPA bawk chun Mosie kuomah, “Hi mipui hi ka hmu chieng tah; ngai ta, mipui kawmawtak an nih:"
10,"now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.","chuleiin, tuhin mi mâksan rawh, an chunga ka lunginsenna chu a hung lum a, anni ka sukbohmang theina dingin; nang ruok chu hnam ropuitakah la siem ka ti che,” a tih a."
11,"And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?","Mosie ruok chun LALPA a Pathien chu a ngên a, “LALPA, Aigupta rama inthawka kut thahrât le thilthawtheina nasatak le i hung ṭhuoi suok hieng i mihai chunga hin iengdingin am i lunginsenna chu lum el a ta?"
12,"Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.","Iengdingin am Aigupta mihai chun, ‘Hnuoi chunga anni sukbo- hmang vawng ding le tlânghaia chun anni sukhlum dingin thiltum ṭha- nawtakin anni a ṭhuoi suok a,’ ti el an ti leh? I lunginsenna ṭiumtaka inthawk chun inher la, i mihai chunga hi thil ṭhanaw hi lakîr rawh."
13,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.","I siehlawhai Abraham, Isak le Israel kuoma nangma le nangma inkhâma, ‘I thlahai chu vâna arasihai angin sukpung ka ta; hi ram po po ka hril ta hi in thlahai kuomah pêng ka ta, kumkhuoin hluong an tih,’ tiha i hril kha hre zing rawh,” a tih a."
14,And Jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people.,"Chun, LALPA chun a mihai chunga thâwng ka tih tiha a hril thil ṭhanaw chu a lâkkîr tah a."
15,"And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.","Chun, Mosie chu ân her a, thuthlung lung phêk pahni chu a kuta chawiin, tlânga inthawk chun a fethla tah a: chu lung phêkhai chu an pang khing hni hniha ziek an nih; a pang khing khat le a pang khingtieng khawm chun ziek ve ve an nih."
16,"And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.","Chu lungphêkhai chu Pathien sinthaw, le Pathien iziek, lung- phêkhai chunga ker an nih."
17,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.","Josua chun mipui khêkri chu a hrietin Mosie kuomah, “Riebûka sawn indona ri a um,” a tih a."
18,"And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear.","Mosie chun, “Hnena khêkri chu a ni nawh a, hneha umhai khêkri khawm a ni bawk nawh a, hlasak ri a ni lem chu ka hriet chu,” a tih a."
19,"And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.","Chun, riebûk kâwl a hung tlunga bâwngte lim le lâm chu a hmu phingleh Mosie lunginsenna chu a hung lum a, a kuthaia inthawk lungphêkhai chu a dehâwn a, tlâng bula chun a sukkawi tah a."
20,"And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.","Bâwngte lim an siem chu a lâk a, meiah a rawh a, a rawt nâwi a, tuiah a phul a, Israel thlahai chu ân dâwntir tah a."
21,"And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?","Mosie chun Aron kuomah, “Hi mipui hin i kuomah ieng am an thawha hienga an chunga suol nasa- tak în tlungtir hi?” a tih a."
22,"And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil.","Aron chun, “Ka lalpa lunginsen- na chu lum naw raw se: hi mipui hi thil suol âwnsa hrim an nih ti nangin i hriet annâwm."
23,"For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.","Ka kuomah, ‘Kan hma ṭhuoitu dingin pathienhai mi siempêk rawh, hi Mosie Aigupta rama inthawka mi ṭhuoi suoktu hlak hi ieng am a chang a ni tah kan hriet si nawh a,’ an tih a."
24,"And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off: so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.","Chun, an kuomah, ‘Tukhawm rângkachak nei chun hlîp raw se,’ ka tih a, chuongchun, an mi hung pêk a, chun, meiah ka rawtui a, hi bâwng- te lim hi a hung suok a ni hi,” a tih a."
25,"And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)","Mosie chun mipui chu zalêntaka um a hmu chun (Aronin a lo khuokhir naw leiin hmêlmahai mithmuah muolphotakin a lo inumtir ta sih a),"
26,"then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoso is on Jehovah’s side, let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.","Mosie chu riebûk kawtkhâra chun a ngîr a, “LALPA tienga ṭhang chu ka kuomah hung raw se,” a tih a. Levi thlahai po po chu ama kuoma chun an hung inkhâwm tah a."
27,"And he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.","Chun, an kuomah, “Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Mi tinin a ngûnhnâm chu a mal chungah sie sienla, riebûk po poah kawtkhâr tinah fe vêl sienla, mi tinin a unaupa, mi tinin a ruolpa khawm, mi tinin a tuolbâwm khawm that raw se,’ a tih,” a tih a."
28,And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.,"Levi thlahai chun Mosie thu ang chun an thawh a; chuongchun, mipui chu chu ni chun mi sâng thum lai an tlu tah a."
29,"And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.","Mosie chun, “Vawisûn hin in chunga malsâwmna a pêk theina ding cheuin, mi tin chu mâni naupa amanih, mâni unaupa amanih chenin LALPA rawngbâwl dingin in inhlân ta hi,” a tih a."
30,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto Jehovah; peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.","A zînga chun Mosie chun mipui kuoma chun, “Thil suol nasatak in thaw ta chu a nih a, chuleiin, LALPA kuomah tuhin hang fêng ka tih, in suolna ta dingin intlanna ka siem thei tâkduoiin,” a tih a."
31,"And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.","Chun, Mosie chu LALPA kuom- ah a hang fe nâwk a, “Aw hi mipui hin suolna nasatak chu an thaw tah a; rângkachak pathienhai an insiem- fâwm a,."
32,"Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.","Nisienlakhawm, rem i ti chun an suolna chu la ngaidam hrâm rawh, chuong a ni naw chun, ka ngên che hi, i lekhabu i zieka inthawk khan mi thaihmang el rawh,” a tih a."
33,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.","LALPA ruok chun Mosie kuom- ah, “Tukhawm ka chunga thil suksuol chu, ama chu ka lekhabua inthawkin thaihmang ka tih."
34,"And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.","Tuhin fe la, hmun ka hrilna chea khan mipui chu ṭhuoi la, ngai ta, ka vântirko i hmaah fêng a tih. Amiruokchu, ka hung sir nia chun an suol man chu anni chungah intlung- tir ka tih,” a ta."
35,"And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.","Chuongchun, Aron isiem bâwngte an siem lei chun LALPAIN mipui chu a hrem tah a."
