1,"Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):","Hieng hi Jakob ruola Aiguptaa hung thla Israel naupasalhai hming chu an nih, mi tin a sûnghai pei leh:"
2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,","Reuben, Simeon, Levi le Juda,"
3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,","Issakar, Zebulun le Benjamin,"
4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.","Dan le Naphtali, Gad le Aser hi."
5,And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.,Jakob ṭhalbea inthawka suok- hai po chu mi sâwmsari an nih; Josef ruok chu Aiguptaah a lo um ta hrim a.
6,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.","Chun, Josef le a unauhai po le, chu ṭhanga mi po chu an thi tah a."
7,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.","Nisienlakhawm, Israel thlahai chu an hung sûngruol a, tamtaka hung inbelsain an hung pung a, nasataka thilthawtheiin an hung um a; ram chu anni hluo sipin a um tah a."
8,"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.",Tuhin Aiguptaa chun Josef hre ngailo lal thar a hung inlal tah a.
9,"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:","A mihai kuoma chun, “En ta u, Israel thlahai hi eini nêkin an tam hlein thil an thaw thei lem bêk a;"
10,"come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.","hung ro, anni hi vartakin sawisâng ei tiu; chuong naw chun hung pung an ta; indona ieng khawm a hung suok pha, anni hin ei hmêlmahai chu ṭhangpuiin mi do an ta, hi rama inthawk hi tlân suok rawi an tih,” a tih a."
11,"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses.","Chuleiin, phurrik takhaia anni sukrinum dingin, an chungah sin- thawhotuhai an siempêk ta ngei a. Chun, Pithom le Rameses, sie- khâwmna khawpuihai chu, Pharao ta dingin an bâwl tah a."
12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm anni chu an sukrimsi po leh an pung zuol deu deuin, an indar lien deu deu lem tah a. Chun, Aigupta mihai chun Israel thlahai chu an ṭithâwng hle el tah a."
13,And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai chu inrimtakin sin an inthawtir a;"
14,"and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor.","an sinthaw po po, lo sin kawng tinrênga le lung rawtnawinaa le ṭêklei siemnaa sin intaktakhai chu rimsitaka inthawtirin an nunhai an sukrinumpêk tah a."
15,"And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:","Chun, Aigupta lal chun Hebrai naudawmtuhai kuoma chun thu a hril tah a; chuhai pakhat hming chu Siphra, a dang hming chu Pua a nih;"
16,"and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.","ama chun, “Hebrai nuhmeihai kuoma naudawmtu sin in va thawha, nau piengna hmun ngeia in va hmu pha; naupasal an ni chun that unla, naunuhmei a ni ruok chun a hringin hla ro,” a tih a."
17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.","Nisienlakhawm, naudawmtu- hai chun Pathien an ṭih a, Aigupta lalin anni thu a pêk angin an thaw nawh a, nautê pasalhai chu an sanhim lem tah a."
18,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?","Chun, Aigupta lal chun nau- dawmtuhai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Iengdinga hi thil hi in thawh a, naupasalhai chu a hringa hla am in nih a?” a tih a."
19,"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.","Naudawmtuhai chun Pharao kuomah, “Hebrai nuhmeihai chu Aigupta nuhmeihai ang an ni nawh a, anni chu an hrisêl a, naudawmtuhai an kuom an tlung hma hin nau chu an lo nei ta hlak a nih,” an tih a."
20,"And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.","Pathienin naudawmtuhai chu ṭhatakin a ngaisak a; Hebrai mihai chu an hung pung a, thilthawtheitak an hung ni tah a."
21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.",Naudawmtuhai chun Pathien an ṭi leiin Pathienin sûngkuoahai a siem tah a.
22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.","Chun, Pharao chun, “Naupasal hung pieng taphawt chu vadungah pei unla, naunuhmei taphawt chu a hringin hla ro,” tiin a mihai chu thu a pêk tlat a."
