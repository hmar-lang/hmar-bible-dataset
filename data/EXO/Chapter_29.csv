2,"and unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them.","bei, chawl ṭhanglo le beiphêk chawl ṭhanglo hriek pawl le, beiin- phân chawl ṭhanglo hriek nâl leh, chuongchu bupui beiphit inditakin i siem ding a nih."
3,"And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.","Chun, leikhâwr pakhatah sieng i ta, leikhâwr chu bâwngchal le berâmchal pahni le chun hung la lût i tih."
4,"And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.","Aron le a naupasalhai chu in- tuokna puon in kawtkhâra chun hung ṭhuoi i ta, tuiin însiltir i tih."
5,"And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod;","Chun, silfênhai chu lâng i ta, Aron chu zakawchung, zakawfuol, zakawsîng le âwmbel chu inhâktir i ta;"
6,"and thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.","zakawsîng hrui thiemtaka khâwng chun khit i ta, a lu chunga chun lukâwm sieng i ta, lukâwm chunga chun lukhum inthieng chu sieng i tih."

10,And thou shalt bring the bullock before the tent of meeting: and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock.,"Intuokna puon in tuola chun bâwngchal ṭhuoi i ta, Aron le a nau- pasalhai chun bâwngchal lu chunga chun an kut innghat an tih."
11,"And thou shalt kill the bullock before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.",Intuokna puon in kawtkhâra chun LALPA hmaah bâwngchal chu that i tih.
12,"And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger; and thou shalt pour out all the blood at the base of the altar.","Bâwngchal thisen chu lâng i ta, i kutpârin mâichâm kîhaia chun nâl i ta; chun, a thisen dang po chu mâichâm bula chun bur i tih."
13,"And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.","Chun, a sûng thâu po chu lâng i ta, a thin chunga duorda le, a kalhai pahni le anni tuomtu thâu leh mâichâm chunga chun rawng i tih."
14,"But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and its dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin-offering.","Bâwngchal sa le, a vun le, a êk ruok chu bûk puoa chun meiin rawng i tih; suol ta dinga thil inhlân a nih."
15,Thou shalt also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.,"Berâmchal pakhat chu la bawk i ta, Aron le a naupasalhai chun berâmchal lu chunga chun an kuthai innghat an tih."
16,"And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.","Berâmchal chu that i ta, a thisen chu lâng i ta, mâichâm chu a vêlin thêng i tih."
17,"And thou shalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.","Berâmchal chu ât nawi i ta, a sûnghai le a kehai chu sâwp i ta, a sa âtsa le, a lu le chun sieng i ta;"
18,"And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering unto Jehovah; it is a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.","berâmchal chu a pumin mâi- châm chunga chun rawng i tih: LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thil- inhlân a na, LALPA kuoma meia thil inhlân riminhnik a nih."
19,And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.,"“Chun, berâm chal dang pakhat chu lâng i ta, Aron le a naupasalhai chun berâmchal lu chunga chun an kuthai innghat an tih."
20,"Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.","Chun, berâmchal chu that i ta, a thisen chu lâng i ta, Aron nakâwr changtieng hmawra le a naupasalhai nakâwr changtieng hmawra le, an changtieng kutpui chunga le, an changtieng kepuihaiah nâl i ta; chun, thisen la um po chun mâichâm chu a vêl chun thêng i tih."
21,"And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.","Mâichâm chunga thisen chu innâlna hriek leh lâng i ta, Aron le a silfênhai le, a naupasalhai le an silfênhai chunga chun thêng i ta, ama chu inhlânthieng nîng a tih; a silfên- hai le a naupasalhai le a naupasalhai silfênhai leh."
22,"Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),","Berâmchal thâu khawm chu a ngûm le a sûngbawtu thâuhai leh, a thin chunga a duorda leh, a kal pahni le a tuomtu thâuhai leh, a dâr chang- tieng leh la bawk i tih (inhlânna berâmchal a ni leiin)."
23,"and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Jehovah:","Chun, bei tliem khat, beiphêk hriek pawl tlang khat le, bei inphân pakhat leh; LALPA hmaha chawl ṭhanglo bei leikhâwra chu lâng i ta;"
24,"and thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and shalt wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.","Aron le a naupasalhai kuthaia chun a rêng chun sie vawng i ta, LALPA hmaha thên thilinhlân dingin thên an tih."
25,"And thou shalt take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before Jehovah: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.","Chun, chuong chu an kuthaia inthawkin lâng i ta, LALPA hmaha riminhnik dingin, mâichâm chunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânin raw hmang i tih: LALPA kuoma meia thilinhlân a nih."
26,"And thou shalt take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thy portion.","Aron inhlânna berâmchal ir chu lâng i ta, LALPA hmaha thên thilin- hlân dingin thên i tih; chu chu nanga chan nîng a tih."
27,"And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:","Thên thilinhlân ir le dawmkâng thilinhlân dâr, inhlânna berâmchal ir le dâr dawmkânga thên tah, thiempu chan khawm chu inhlân i tih, Aron le a naupasalhai chan a ni leiin."
28,"and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, even their heave-offering unto Jehovah.",Aron le a naupasalhai chan dinga Israel thilinhlân an pêk zing ding an bat nîng a tih; chu chu an inremna thilinhlânhaia inthawka thiempu chan dinga Israel thlahai inhlân ding chu nîng a tih; LALPA kuoma an dawmkâng thil inhlân chu a nih.
29,"And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.","“Aron silfên inthienghai chu ama hnunga a naupasalhai ta dingin nîng a tih, chuonghaia hlânthieng le hrieknâl an ni theina dingin."
30,"Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.","Hmun Inthienga rawng bâwl dinga a hung pha, ama aia thiempu sin thawtu a naupa chun silfênhai chu ni sari sûng hâk a tih."
31,"And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place.","“Inhlânna berâmchal chu lâng i ta, Hmun Inthienga chun a sa chu suong i tih."
32,"And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.",Aron le a naupasalhai chu berâm sa le leikhâwra bei chu intuok- na puon ina kawt bula chun fâng an tih.
33,"And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.","Chuong thil intlanna siemnahai chu anni inhlânna le hlânthiengna dingin fâng an tih, amiruokchu, thil inthieng an ni leiin mi dang chun a fâk ve ding a ni nawh."
34,"And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.","Inhlânna sa le bei a iengkhawm chu zîngkâr chena a um zing chun, a mahla chu meiin rawng i tih, thil inthieng a ni leiin fâk a ni ding a ni nawh."
35,"And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.","Chuong ang chun Aron le a naupasalhai chungah, thu ka pêk che po po ang tak khan i thaw ding a na; ni sari sûng anni chu i hlânthieng ding a nih,"
36,"And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.","ni tinin suol ta dinga thil inhlân bâwngchal chu inhlân i tih. Mâichâm ta ding khawm chun suol ta dinga thilinhlân inhlân i ta, chu ta dinga intlanna i siem lai chun, inhlân thiengna dingin, mâichâm chu hriek nâl bawk i tih."
37,"Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.","Mâichâm ta dingin ni sari sûng chu intlanna siem i ta, chun, inhlân i tih; chun, mâichâm chu inthiengtak hung nîng a ta, mâichâm tâwk taphawt chu inthieng ni tâng an tih."
38,Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.,“Hi hi mâichâm chunga i thilinhlân ding chu a nih; berâmte pahni kum khat mi ve ve ni tinin în hlân zie ding a nih.
39,The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:,"Berâmte pakhat chu zîngtieng inhlân i ta, berâmte dang chu zân- tieng inhlân i tih."
40,"and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering.","Berâmte pakhat le chun beiphit indi epha hmun sâwma ṭheha hmun khat hriek sâwrsa hin hmun liha ṭheha hmun khat chawkpawl, le dâwnmi thilinhlân dingin uoiin hin hmun liha ṭheha hmun khat inhlân i tih."
41,"And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.","Berâmte pakhat chu zântieng inhlân i ta, LALPA kuoma meia thil- inhlâna riminhnik dingin, zîngkâra dâwnmi thilinhlân ṭhanga fâkmi thilinhlân dân angin thâwng i tih."
42,"It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee.",Chu chu i thlahai chena dingin LALPA hmaha intuokna puon in kawtkhâra pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu ni zing a tih; chutaka chun intuokpui ka ti che.
43,And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and the Tent shall be sanctified by my glory.,"Chutaka chun Israel thlahai chu intuokpui ka ta, intuokna puon in chu ka ropuinain sukthieng nîng a tih."
44,"And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to me in the priest’s office.","Intuokna puon in le mâichâm chu sukthieng ka ta, Aron le a nau- pasalhai khawm chu thiempu sina ka rawng bâwl dingin sukthieng ka tih."
45,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.","Israel thlahai lai chun um zing ka ta, an Pathien nîng ka tih."
46,"And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am Jehovah their God.","Chun, anni laia ka um zing theina dinga Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu LALPA an Pathien ka nih ti hrieng an tih; LALPA an Pathien ka ni sih a."
