Ân sângtieng chu tawng hni nîng a ta, chutaka a kihai chu ama le zawm- khat an ni ding a nih."
3,"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.","A chung le a sîrhai, a vêlin, a kihai leh rângkachak inluonkhum i ta; chun, a vêlin rângkachak rei siem bawk i tih."

7,"And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it.","Chun, Aronin chu chunga chun thil riminhnik chu râwng a ta, zîng tinin khâwnvarhai chu a chei pha raw hlak a tih."
8,"And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.",Aron chun zântienga khâwnvar- hai ân sit pha chun raw bawk a tih; in thlahai chenin LALPA hmaah rimin- hnik chu raw zing in tih.
9,"Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon.","Chu chunga chun riminhniklo thil, pumrawhmang thilinhlân khawm, fâkmi thilinhlân khawm în hlân ding a ni nawh a, dâwnmi thilinhlân hrim a chunga chun i bur ding a ni bawk nawh."
10,And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto Jehovah.,"Aron chun a kihai chunga chun kum khata vawi khat intlanna siem a ta; in thlahai chenin intlanna suol ta dinga thilinhlân thisen chun kum khatah vawikhat mâichâm ta dinga intlanna siempêk a tih, LALPA kuoma inthiengtak a nih,” tiin."
11,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah a hril a,"
12,"When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.","“Israel thlahai nizât i tiem pha chun, tiem an ninaa an nizât ang peiin, mi tinin ama ta dingin intlanna sum pêk ding a nih, anni i tiem pha anni laia hri a um nawna dingin."
13,"This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah.","Intiemnaa tiema um taphawt chun pêng a tih: Hmun Inthieng sum dingin shekel chenve (shekel khat chu gerah sâwmhni a nih), LALPA kuoma thilinhlân dingin shekel chenve bawk pêng a tih."
14,"Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah.","Mi tin intiemnaa ṭhang phâk, kum sâwmhniha upa le a chung- tienghai chun LALPA thilinhlân a pêk ding a nih."
15,"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.","In hringna ta dinga intlanna siem dinga LALPA kuoma thilinhlân in pêk pha chun hausa khawmin shekel chenve nêka tam pe naw nih a, pasie khawma chu nêka tlâwm chu a pêk ding a ni nawh."
16,"And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.","Israel thlahai kuoma inthawkin intlanna sum chu lâng i ta, intuokna puon in rawngbâwlna dingin hmang i tih; in hringna ta dinga intlanna siem dinga LALPA hmaha Israel thlahai ta dinga hriet zingna a ni theina dingin,” tiin."
17,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie kuoma chun a hril a,"
18,"Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash. And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.","“Insâwpna dingin, dâr maihûn, a ṭhut khawm dârin i siem bawk ding a nih. Mâichâm le intuokna puon in inkâra chun sieng i ta, a sûnga chun tui sie bawk i tih."
19,And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:,Aron le a naupasalhai chun chutaka chun an kuthai an kehai sâwp an tih.
20,"when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.","Intuokna puon ina an lût ding phain amanih, LALPA kuoma meia thil inhlân raw dinga mâichâm hnaia rawngbâwl dinga an hung phain, tuia chun an insâwp ding a nih, an thi nawna dingin."
21,"So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.","An kuthai, an kehai sâwp an tih.; chuongchun, thi naw ni hai; chun, anni ta dingin kumkhuoha dân nîng a tih, ama le a chithla le an thlahai chen khawmin,” tiin."
22,"Moreover Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","Chu naw khawm chu LALPAIN Mosie kuoma chun a hril a,"
23,"Take thou also unto thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty,","“Riminhnik pui deu deuhai la la, murra tui inthieng shekel za nga bûk, thingzungthak riminhnik chu zâtve, chu chu shekel za hni sâwmnga, mafu riminhnik shekel za hni sâwmnga,"
24,"and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin;","thingzungthak chi dang shekel za nga bûk; hieng hi Hmun Inthieng- a shekel bûk hmang dân ang peiin nîng a ta; chun, oliv hriek hin khat leh;"
25,"and thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.","hienghai hi chawkpawlin innâl- na hriek inthieng, rim inhniktak, riminhnik siemtu siem dân angtakin siem i ta, chu chu innâlna hriek inthieng nîng a tih."
26,"And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,","Chu hriek chun intuokna puon in le Thuthlung bâwm,"
27,"and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense,","dawkân le a hmangruo po po, khâwnvar siena le a hmangruo dang po po le riminhnik rawna mâichâm le,"
28,"and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof.","pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâichâm le a hmangruo po po le, dâr maihûn le ân ṭhutna le chun nâl i tih."
29,"And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.","Chun, inthiengtak an ni theina dingin inhlân i ta, chu chu tâwk taphawt chu inthieng an tih."
30,"And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office.","Chun, Aron le a naupasalhai chu thiempu sina ka hmaha rawng an bâwl theina dingin nâl i ta, inhlân bawk i tih."
31,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.","Israel thlahai kuoma chun hril la, ‘Hi hi in thlahai chenin ka kuoma innâlna hriek inthieng nîng a tih."
32,"Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.","Mi narân taksa chunga hrim hrim buok a ni ding a ni nawh a, hi chawkpawl angtak hin, ama ang hi in siem ding a ni nawh: inthieng a nih a, in ta ding khawmin inthieng a ni ding a nih."
33,"Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.","Tukhawm ama angtaka lo chawkpawl amanih, mi narân chunga lo nâl amanih, an um chun, ama chu a mihai laia inthawka sâtthlâk nîng a tih,’ tiin,” a tih a."
34,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight;","Chun, LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Hieng riminhnikhai, stak- te le onikha le galbanam la la; hieng riminhnikhai hi rimtui in- thieng leh bûk intluk seng an ni ding a nih."
35,"and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:","Riminhnik siemtu siem dân angtakin, riminhnik rawmi, rimin- hniktakin, chiha saw, inthieng le faitakin siem i tih."
36,"and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.","A hlek chite vaw thla hlak i ta, kân tuokpuina ding che intuokna puon ina Thuthlung bâwm hmaa chun sieng i ta, i ta dinga inthiengtak a ni ding a nih."
37,"And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for Jehovah.",Hieng chawkpawl dân anga riminhnik i siem chu nanga ta dingin i siem ding a ni nawh a: i ta ding chun LALPA ta dinga inthieng a ni ding a nih.
38,"Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people.","Mi tukhawm mâni hmang dinga chuong anga rim nei siemtu chu a mihai laia inthawka sât thlâk nîng a tih,” tiin."
