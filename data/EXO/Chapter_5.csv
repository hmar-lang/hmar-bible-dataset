1,"And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.","Chun, chu hnunga chun Mosie le Aron chu an va feh a, Pharao kuomah, “Hieng ang hin LALPA, Israel Pathien chun a tih, ‘Thlalêra ka kuoma ruoi an ṭhe theina dingin ka mihai chu infetir rawh,’ a tih,” an tih a."
2,"And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go.","Pharao chun, “Israelhai infetir dinga a rawl ka ngai ding LALPA chu tûm a na? LALPA chu ka hriet ngai nawh a, chu nawa khawm, Israelhai chu infetir naw bawk ka tih,” a tih a."
3,"And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.","Anni chun, “Hebraihai Pathien chun a mîn tuokpui tah a, kan ngên che, LALPA kan Pathien kuoma inthâwi dingin thlalêra ni thum lam chenah mîn fetir rawh; chuong naw chun kan chungah kâwlhnâmin amanih, hriin amanih tla rawi a tih,” an tih a."
4,"And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.","Aigupta lal chun an kuomah, “Nangni Mosie le Aron hin iengti- zieha mipuihai hi an sinthawhaia in- thawk in inchawltir am? In sin chu va thaw ṭawk ṭawk unla a ni el,” a tih a."
5,"And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.","Pharao bawk chun, “Ngai ta, tuhin hi rama mihai hi an tam ta hleh a; an sinhaia inthawk in inchawltir el a!” a tih a."
6,"And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,","Chu ni ma chun mipuihai sinthaw hotuhai le an hotuhai chu Pharao chun thu a pêk a,"
7,"Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.","“Kha hma ang khan mipuihai chu ṭêklei siem dingin bupâwl pe ngai ta naw unla, fe hai sienla, an bupâwl ding chu annîn inkhâwm lem raw hai se."
8,"And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.","Chun, kha hmaa ṭêklei an siem zât tho kha siem dingin phût unla, ieng kawng khawmin suktlâwm naw ro: an tha a bo sih a; chuleiin annâwm, ‘Mîn fetir la, kan Pathien kuomah mîn thâwitir rawh,’ tiha an khêk hi."
9,"Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.","Chuong mihai chunga chun sin rik lem chu innghat ni raw se; inrimtaka an thaw theina dingin; chun, thu teplo mei mei chu ngaisak naw bawk raw hai se,” a tih a."
10,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.","Chun, mipuihai sinthaw hotu- hai le an hotuhai chu an fe suok a, mipuihai kuoma chun, “Pharao chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Bupâwl chu pe naw ning cheu ah."
11,"Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.","Fe unla, in hmu theina naah va la ro: anachu in sinthaw chu suk- tlâwm ni chuong naw nih,’ tiin” an tih a."
12,So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.,"Chuongchun, mipuihai chu Aigupta ram sûng po poa chun bupâwl aiah bu kûng la khâwm ding chun an indar ta sup sup a."
13,"And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.","Sinthaw hotuhai chu, “Bupâwl umsa laia in sinthawhai, in ni tin sinthawhai ang kha tlingtla ro,” tiha nawr sênin ṭul namên loin an ṭûl a."
14,"And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?","Pharao sinthaw hotuhaiin mi- pui chunga Israel thla, hotua an siehai chu, “Vawisûn le zâni khawm, kha hma anga ṭêklei siema in sinthawhai chu iengdinga in tlingtla naw am a na?” tiha suosal le vuokin an um tah a."
15,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?","Chun, Israel thla hotuhai chu Pharao kuomah an hung a, an khêk a, “I siehlawhai hi iengdinga hienga i mi thaw am a na?"
16,"There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.","I siehlawhai hi bupâwl pêk kan ni nawh a, kan kuomah, ‘Ṭêklei siem ro,’ an ti sih a! Chun, ngai ta, i sie- hlawhai hi vuokin kan um a; nisien- lakhawm, ân diknawna chu nangma mihai ngeiah a ni lem,” an tih a."
17,"But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.","Pharao ruok chun, “In zawm- thaw, in zawmthaw; chuleichun, ‘Mîn fetir la, LALPA kuomah mîn thâwitir rawh,’ in tih a."
18,"Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.","Tuhin fe unla, sin thaw el ro; bupâwl chu pêk ni hliek naw ti niu, ṭêklei ruok chu siem ding zât pângngai chu in pêk suok ngei ding a nih,” a tih a."
19,"And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily tasks.","Israel thla hotuhai chun, “Ieng kawng khawmin, in ni tin sinthawha ṭêklei siem ding zât chu in suktlâwm ding a ni nawh,” ti hril an ni chun ngîrhmun ṭha nawtaka um an nih ti an inhriet tah a."
20,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:","Pharao ina inthawka an hung suok chun, anni lo nghâk zingtu Mosie le Aron chu an va hmuh a,"
21,"and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.","an kuomah, “LALPAIN en cheuin in chungthu chu rêl raw se, keini mi thatna dinga an kuta kâwl- hnâm chawi dingin, Pharao le a siehlawhai mithmuah theidaumah in mi siem ta lei hin,” an tih a."
22,"And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?","Chun, Mosie chu LALPA kuom tieng a ngha nâwk a, “Lalpa, iengdinga hi mihai chunga hin thil ṭhanaw thaw am i nih a? Iengdinga i mi tir hrim am?"
23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.","Pharao kuoma i hminga thu hril dinga ka hung chinah, hi mihai chungah tlatsiet a thawh a, nangin i sansuok dêr si nawh a,” a tih a."
