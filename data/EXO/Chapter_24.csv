3,"And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do.","Mosie chu a hung a, LALPA thu po po le dânhai po po chu mipui a hril tah a. Mipui po po chun thu thu- hmunin an dawn a, “LALPAIN thu a hril po po chu thâwng kan tih,” an tih a."
4,"And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.","Mosie chun LALPA thuhai po po chu a ziek a, zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a; tlâng hnuoia chun mâichâm le lungphun sâwmpahni, Israel hnam sâwmpahni aiawin a phun tah a."

7,"And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do, and be obedient.","Chun, thuthlungna lekhabu chu a lâk a, mipui hrieta chun a tiem tah a; anni chun, “LALPAIN a hril taphawt chu thâwng kan ta, thu- awitakin um kan tih,” an tih a."
8,"And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these words.","Chun, Mosie chun thisen chu a lâk a, mipui chu a theh a, “Hieng thuhai po po chungthua LALPAIN thisen thuthlung a siempêk cheu hi en ta u,” a tih a."
9,"Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:","Chun, Mosie le Aron, Nadab, Abihu le, Israel upa sâwmsari chu an hang feh a;"
10,"and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.","chun, Israel Pathien chu an hmuh a, a kehai hnuoia chun sapphir lung rem ang tletak, a tlêtzie chu vân thil ni âwm tak hrim hi a um a."
11,"And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld God, and did eat and drink.","Israel thla miṭhahai chungah a kut ân nghat nawh a; Pathien chu an hmu ngei a, an fâkin an dâwn a."
12,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Tlângah ka kuomah hung la, chutaka chun um rawh; dân le thupêk le anni inchûktirna dinga ka ziekhai, lung phêk pahni chu pêng ka ti che,” a tih a."
13,"And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister: and Moses went up into the mount of God.","Mosie le a rawngbâwltu Josua chu an tho a, Mosie chu Pathien tlânga chun a hang fe tah a."
14,"And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them.","Upahai kuoma chun, “Hitaka hin keini mi lo nghâk ro, in kuoma kan hung nâwk hmakhat chu: chun, ngai ta u, Aron le Hur hi in kuomah an um a, tukhawm thubuoi nei chun an kuomah lo fe raw se,” a tih a."
15,"And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.","Chun, Mosie chu tlânga chun a hang feh a, tlâng chu sûmin ân khum tah a."
16,"And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.","LALPA ropuina chu Sinai tlânga chun a um zing a, ni ruk sûng sûmin ân khum a; ni sari ni chun sûm laia inthawk chun Mosie a ko tah a."
17,And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.,"Israel thlahai mita LALPA ropuina inlang dân chu, tlâng sîpa chun kânghmangna meichawk ang a nih."
18,"And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.","Mosie chu sûm zîng hnuoia chun a lût a, tlânga chun a hang fe tah a. Mosie chu ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli tlânga chun a um tah a."
