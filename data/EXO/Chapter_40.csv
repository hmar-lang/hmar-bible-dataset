2,On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.,“Thla khatna ni khat niah intuokna puon in biekbûk chu în ngîr ding a nih.
3,"And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil.","Chun, a sûnga chun Thuthlung bâwm chu sieng i ta, Thuthlung bâwm chu puonzârin zâr hlieng i tih."
4,"And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.","Dawkân chu hung la lût i ta, a chunga thil umhai chu indawt peiin sieng i tih: khâwnvar siena chu hung la lût i ta, chutaka chun khâwnvarhai chu inṭhut i tih."
5,"And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.","Riminhnik rawna rângkachak mâichâm chu Thuthlung bâwm hmaa chun inṭhut i ta, biekbûk kawtkhâr puonzâr chu zâr i tih."
6,And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.,Pumrawhmang inhlânna mâi- châm chu intuokna puon in biekbûk kawtkhâr hmaa chun inṭhut i tih.
7,"And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein.","Maihûn chu intuokna puon in le mâichâm inkâra chun inṭhut i ta, a sûngah tui sieng i tih."
8,"And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.","Tuolzâwl inhuonna chu a vêlin inngîr i ta, tuolzâwl inhuonna puonzârhai chu khai i tih."
9,"And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy.","Chun, innâlna hriek lâng i ta, biekbûk le a sûnga um po po chu nâl i ta, inhlân i ta, chutaka hmangruo po po le chun; chuongchun, hung inthieng tâng an tih."
10,"And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy.","Chun, pumrawhmang inhlânna mâichâm chu nâl i ta, a hmagruo po po khawm nâl bawk i ta; chun, mâichâm chu inhlân i ta, mâichâm chu inthiengtak hung ni tâng a tih."
11,"And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.","Maihûn le ân ṭhutna khawm nâl i ta, inhlân i tih."
12,"And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.","Chun, Aron le a naupasalhai chu intuokna puonin kawtkhâra chun hung ṭhuoi i ta tuiin insiltir i tih."
13,"And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.","Aron chunga chun silfên inthienghai chu bel i ta, ama chu hriek nâl i ta, inhlân i tih, thiempu sina ka rawng a bâwl theina dingin."
14,"And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them;","A naupasalhai chu hung ṭhuoi i ta, anni chu zakawchunghai inhâktir i ta,"
15,"and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.","an pa i nâl ang bawk khan hriek nâl i tih, thiempu sina ka rawng an bâwl theina dingin. Hriek nâl an nina chu an ta dingin an thlahai chena thiempu an ni zingna ding nîng a tih,” tiin."
16,"Thus did Moses: according to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he.",LALPAIN thu a pêk po po angin Mosie chun a thawh a; chuong ang tak chun a thaw a nih.
17,"And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.","Chun, kum hninaa thla hmasa tak, chu thla ni khatnaa chun biekbûk chu inngîr a lo ni tah a."
18,"And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars.","Mosie chun biekbûk chu ân ngîr a, a kerkuokhai chu a sieh a, chutaka chun a thingphêkhai chu ân ngîr a, a bangruhai chu a thun lût a, a banhai chu ân ngîr tah a."
19,"And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","A puon in chu biekbûk chunga chun a keiphar a, a chunga chun inkhumnain ân khum a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang tak chun."
20,"And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:","Chun, thuthlung chu a lâk a, Thuthlung bâwm sûnga chun a sie tah a; Thuthlung bâwma chun a zâwnfunghai a rawl a; Thuthlung bâwm chunga chun zângaina ṭhung- pha chu a sieh a;"
21,"and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","chun, Thuthlung bâwm chu biekbûk sûnga chun a hung lâk lût a; pindangna puonzârhai chu a khai a, Thuthlung bâwm chu a zarhlieh a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang tak chun."
22,"And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.","Puonzâr puo biekbûk hmar- tieng pangah intuokna puon ina chun dawkân a sieh a,"
23,And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.,"LALPA hmaah bei chu indawt thlie hin a sieh a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang tak chun."
24,"And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.","Biekbûk simtieng pangah daw- kân zawna chun sathâu khâwnvar siena chu a sieh a,"
25,And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.,"LALPA hmaa chun khâwn- varhai chu ân ṭhut a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang tak chun."
26,And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil:,"Puonzâr hmaah, intuokna puon ina chun rângkachak mâichâm chu a sieh a,"
27,and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses.,"chu chunga chun riminhnik rawmi chu a rawh a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang tak chun."
28,And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.,"Chun, biekbûk kawtkhâr puon- zârhai chu a zâr a."
29,"And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Intuokna puon in biekbûk kawt- khâra chun pumrawhmang thil inhlânna mâichâm chu ân tung a, a chunga chun pumrawmhmang thilin- hlânhai le fâkmi thilinhlânhai ân hlân a, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang tak chun."
30,"And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash.","Mâichâm le intuokna puon in inkâra chun maihûn chu ân ṭhut a, insâwpna dingin a sûnga chun tui a sieh a."
31,And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat;,Chutaka chun Mosie le Aron le a naupasalhai chun an kuthai le an kehai an sâwp hlak a;
32,"when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses.",intuokna puon ina an lût pha le mâichâm hnaia an hung pha an sâwp hlak; LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang tak chun.
33,"And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.","Tuolzâwl inhuonna chu biekbûk le mâichâm huol vêl vawngin ân ngîr a, tuolzâwl inhuonna kawtkhâr puonzârhai khawm a khai a. Chuong- chun, Mosie chun sin chu a zo tah a."
34,"Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.","Chun, sûm chun intuokna puon in chu ân khum a, LALPA ropuinain biekbûk chu a suksip a."
35,"And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.","Biekbûk chu LALPA ropuinain a suksip leiin le, sûm chu a chunga a um zing leiin Mosie chu intuokna puon in sûngah a lût thei ta nawh a."
36,"And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys:","An inzin sûng po po chun, sûm chu biekbûk chunga inthawka lâk kânga a um phingleh Israel thlahai chun hmatieng an pan pei a;"
37,"but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.","sûm chu lâk kânga a um naw ruok chun, lâk kânga a um ni hma po chun an fe suok ngai nawh a."
38,"For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.","An inzin sûng po chun, Israel sûnghai po po mithmuah, LALPA sûm chu biekbûk chungah sûnah a um a, zâna chun sûma chun mei- chawk a um hlak a."
