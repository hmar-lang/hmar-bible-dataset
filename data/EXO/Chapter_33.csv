1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Suok unla, hitaka inthawkin nang le Aigupta rama inthawka mipui i ṭhuoi suokhai chu, Abraham, Isak le Jakob kuoma, ‘I thlahai kuomah pêng ka tih,’ tiha ka tiem tah ram tieng chun fe ro."
2,"and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:","In hmaah ka vântirko tir ka ta, Kanaan mihai, Amor mihai, Hit mihai, Periz mihai, Hiv mihai le Jebus mihai chu hnawt suok ka tih."
3,"unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiffnecked people, lest I consume thee in the way.","Khuoizu le nênetuia luong rama chun fe ro; kei ruok chu nangni lai fe ve naw ning, chuong naw chun lam kârah sukbohmang hlau rawi ka ti cheu, mi kâwmâwtak in ni sih a,” a tih a."
4,"And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.","Mipuiin hi thuthang ṭhanaw hi an hriet chun an sûn a, tukhawmin an incheina chu an inbel ta nawh a."
5,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Israel thlahai kuomah hril rawh, ‘Mi kâwmâwtak in nih a, mitkhapkâr bak khawm nangni laia ka fe ve chun ka sukbohmang ding cheu a nih a; chuleiin, in incheinahai chu hlîp ro, iengtin am ka thaw ding cheu a nih ti ka hriet theina dingin,’ tiin,” a tih a."
6,And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.,"Chuongchun, Israel thlahai chun Horeb tlânga inthawk chu an in- cheinahai chu an hlîp ta vawng a."
7,"Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp.","Mosie chun puon in chu a sawm pei a, riebûk puotieng, riebûka in- thawka hla deua hin a zar hlak a; chu chu “Intuokna puon in” tiin ân bûk a. Mi tin LALPA zawngtu taphawt chu riebûk puoha um puon ina chun an fe hlak a."
8,"And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent.","Mosie chu puon ina a fe lai chun mipui po po chu an tho a, mi tin chu mâni puon in kawtkhâra chun an ngîr a, Mosie chu puon ina a lût chenin an enzui pei a."
9,"And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and Jehovah spake with Moses.","Mosie puon ina a lût phingleh sûm ngîr a hung thlah a, puon in kawtkhâra chun a ngîr a; chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuomah thu a hril hlak a."
10,"And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door.","Mipui chun sûm ngîr kawt- khâra ngîr an hmu pha chun, mipui po po chu an tho a, mâni puon in kawtkhâr chita chun mi tinin chibai an bûk hlak a."
11,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.","LALPA chun Mosie chu inhma- tuoin, miin a ruol a biek angtakin a biek hlak a. Chun, Mosie chu riebûk tieng a kîr nâwk a, a rawngbâwltu Joshua, Nun naupa, tlangvâl ruok chun puon in chu a mâksan nawh."
12,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found favor in my sight.","Mosie chun LALPA kuomah, “Ngai ta, nangin ka kuomah, ‘Mipui hi hung ṭhuoi rawh,’ i tih a, kei le i tir ding chu tu am a nih i mîn hriettir si nawh a. Nisienlakhawm, nangin, ‘I hmingin ka hriet cheh a, ka mit- hmuah lunginsietna i chang ta bawk a nih,’ i tih a."
13,"Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.","Chuleiin, tuhin ka ngên che, i mithmuah lunginsietna ka chang a ni chun, nang ka hriet cheh a, nanga mithmua lunginsietna chu a tâwp chena ka hmu theina dingin i lamhai chu mîn entir rawh: chun, hi hnam hi i mihai an ni hi ngaituo rawh,” a tih a."
14,"And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.","LALPA chun, “I kuomah fe ve pei ka ta, châwlna pêng ka ti che,” a tih a."
15,"And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.","Mosie chun a kuomah, “Ka kuomah i fe ve pei naw ding chun hitaka inthawk keini mi ṭhuoi tung ta naw rawh."
16,"For wherein now shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?",Kei le i mihai hin i lunginsietna kan hmu tah ti iengtin am inhriet a ta? Hnuoi chunga um mi dang po poa inthawk kei le i mihai ṭheha kan umna chu keini le i fe ve zingnaa chun a ni naw ding am a nih?” a tih a.
17,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “I hril ang tak chun thâwng ka tih: hmingin ka hriet cheh a, ka lung- insietna chu i hmu ta sih a,” a tih a."
18,"And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory.","Mosie chun, “Ka ngên che, i ropuina chu mîn hmutir rawh,” a tih a."
19,"And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka ṭhatna po po i hmaah fêng a ta, ka hming ‘LALPA chu’ i hmaah puongdar ka tih; ka lunginsiet dinghai chu lunginsiet ka ta, za ka ngaina dinghai chunga chun za ngai ka tih."
20,"And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for man shall not see me and live.","Nisienlakhawm, Ka hmêl chu hmu thei naw ti nih, tukhawm ka hmêl hmu chu an hring ding a ni si nawh a,” a tih a."
21,"And Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock:","LALPA bawk chun, “En ta, ka kâwla hi lungpui chungah i ngîrna ding a um;"
22,"and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by:","ka ropuinain a fe khêl lai che chun lungpui kak kârah sieng ka ti cheh a, ka kutin i hmai hlieng ka ti che;"
23,"and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back; but my face shall not be seen.","chun, ka kut chu la hmang ka ta, ka hnungtieng chu hmûng i ta, ka hmai ruok chu hmu a ni ding a ni nawh,” a tih a."
