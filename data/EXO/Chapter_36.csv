1,"And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Jehovah hath commanded.","“Bezalel le Oholiab le mi themthiem tukhawm, Hmun Inthieng bâwlnaa sin po pohai thaw dân hre dinga an lungrila LALPAIN thiemna le varna a sienahai taphawt chun LALPAIN thu a pêk po po ang tak chun thâwng an tih,” a tih a."
2,"And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:","Mosie chun Bezalel, Oholiab le mi themthiem LALPAIN an lungrila thiemna a pêkhai, chu sin thaw dinga an lungrila phûr takhai phawt chu, sin chu thaw dingin a ko a."
3,"and they received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to make it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning.",Anni chun Israel thlahaiin Hmun Inthieng bâwlnaa hmang dinga nuomthua thilpêk an hung chawihai po po chu Mosie kuoma inthawkin an lâk a. Zîng tinin ama kuoma chun mâni nuomthua thilpêk chu an la hung chawi zing a.
4,"And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought;","Chun, mi themthiem Hmun In- thienga sinthawtuhai po po chu, mi tin chu an sinthawna senga in- thawkin, an hung a,"
5,"and they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make.","Mosie kuoma chun, “LALPAIN siem dinga thu a pêk, hi sin thawnaa hmang ding hin a huntâwk nêka tam lem mipuiin an hung lâk tah,” an tih a."
6,"And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun, “Pasal khawmin, nuhmei khawmin Hmun Inthienga dinga thilpêk dang hrim pe ta naw raw hai se,” tiin thu a pêk a, chu thu chu riebûk po poa puong a ni tah a. Chuongchun, mipui chu an hung pêk khap an ni tah a:"
7,"For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.","Hmangruo an nei chu sin po poa hmang ding chun a huntâwk tah a, a tam taluo rau ta leiin."
8,"And all the wise-hearted men among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, Bezalel made them.","Anni laia sinthawtu mi them- thiemhai po po chun biekbûk chu puonzâr sâwm, puon zai inhmi kawp le, sahmul dumpâwl, a êm, le a seninlâr, cherubhai lim kutthiemtaka chei chun an siem tah a."
9,"The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains had one measure.","Puonzâr tin seitieng chu tawng sâwmhni pariet, puonzâr tin lien- tieng chu tawng li a nih a, puonzâr po po chu ân tie vawng a nih."
10,And he coupled five curtains one to another: and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.,"Chun, puonzâr panga chu a ṭhui zawm a, puonzâr panga dang chu a ṭhuizawm bawk a."
11,And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.,"Puonzâr pakhat a thuo laia kâwlhnung tak tlânga chun valbahai dumpâwlin a siem a, chuong ang bawk chun a thuo hninaa puon- zâr puo tak tlânga chun a siem bawk a."
12,"Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling: the loops were opposite one to another.","Puonzâr pakhata chun valba sâwmnga a siem a, a thuo hninaa puonzâr pakhat tlânga chun valba sâwmnga bawk a siem a; valbahai chu an inzawm seng bawk a."
13,"And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was one.","Chun, rângkachak puonchepna sâwmnga a siem a, chuong puon- chepnahai chun puonzârhai chu an cheptuoh a: chuongchun, biekbûk chu pakhat a hung ni tah a."
14,And he made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.,"Biekbûka puon in inkhumna ding chun kêl hmul puonzârhai a siem a, puonzâr chu sâwm le pakhat a siem a."
15,"The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain: the eleven curtains had one measure.","Puonzâr tin seitieng chu tawng sâwmthum, puonzâr tin lientieng chu tawng li a nih; puonzâr sâwm le pakhat chu an intie seng a."
16,"And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.","Puonzâr panga chu a ṭhui zawm a, puonzâr paruk chu a ṭhui zawm bawk a."
17,"And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling.","Puonzâr hmasa a kâwlhnung tak tlânga chun valba sâwmnga a siem a, a thuo hninaa puonzâr kâwl- hnung tak tlânga chun valba sâwmnga bawk a siem a."
18,"And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.",Puon in chu pindan pakhat a ni theina dinga chep khâwmna ding- in dârsen puonchepna sâwmnga a siem a.
19,"And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.",Chu puon in inkhumna ding chu berâmchal vun suksenin le chu chung nâwka chun seal vunhaiin inkhumna a siem a.
20,"And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of acacia wood, standing up.","Chun, biekbûk bang intunghai chu shittim thingin a siem a."
21,"Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board.","Thingphêk tin seitieng chu tawng sâwm, thingphêk tin lientieng chu tawng khat le a chenve a nih."
22,"Each board had two tenons, joined one to another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.","Thingphêk tin chun rek pahni, a dang le thun zawmna ding a nei seng a; biekbûk thingphêk po po chu chuong ang seng chun a siem vawng a."
23,And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward;,"Biekbûka thingphêkhai chu chuong ang chun a siem a, sim- sawngah thingphêk sâwmhni,"
24,"and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.","chun, thingphêk sâwmhni hnuoia chun tangkaruo kerkuok sâwmli, thingphêk pakhat hnuoiah a rek pahni inṭhutna dingin kerkuok pahni pei; chun, thingphêk dang hnuoia khawm a rek pahni in ṭhut- na ding kerkuok pahni pei bawk a siem a."
25,"And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,","Chun, biekbûk sîr hnina, a hmartieng panga chun, thingphêk sâwmhni le,"
26,"and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.","an inṭhutna ding tangkaruo kerkuok sâwmli a siem a; thingphêk pakhat hnuoiah kerkuok pahni, thingphêk dang hnuoiah kerkuok pahni bawk."
27,And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.,Biekbûk châwrtieng thlang- tieng panga chun thingphêk paruk a siem a.
28,And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part.,Biekbûk châwrtieng kihaia dingin thingphêk pahni a siem a.
29,And they were double beneath; and in like manner they were entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus he did to both of them in the two corners.,"Chun, a hnuoitieng chun suk- tuok an nih a, a chungtieng ruok chun a sîpah, kuol pakhata chel khâwm an nih a, a kihai pahnia mi chu chuong ang ve ve chun a thawh a."
30,"And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.","Chuongchun, thingphêk pariet an inṭhutna tangkaruo seng leh; ker- kuok sâwmparuk, thingphêk pakhat hnuoiah kerkuok pahni peiin a um a."
31,"And he made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,","Chun, shittim thing bangru- hai a siem a, biekbûk sîr khata thingphêkhai dingin bangru panga,"
32,"and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.","biekbûk sîr khingtienga thing- phêkhai dingin bangru panga bawk, biekbûk châwrtieng thlangtieng panga thingphêkhai dingin bangru panga."
33,And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.,A bangru lailung tak chu a thingphêkhai sûngah a tâwp taka inthawka khingtieng tâwp tak chena rawl thlengin a siem a.
34,"And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.","Thingphêkhai chu rângkachak- in ân luon khum a; chun, a bangruhai rawlna dingin rângkachak kuolhai a siem a, bangruhai chu rângkachakin ân luon khum bawk a."
35,"And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, made he it.","Chun, puonzâr sahmul dum- pâwl, a êm le a seninlâr le, pat zai inhmi kawpin, cherubhai lim kut- thiemtaka siemhaia cheiin a siem a."
36,"And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.","Chu khaina ding chun shittim thing ban pali a siem a, rângkachakin ân luon khum a; an kuoikimhai chu rângkachak a nih a, an inṭhutna dingin tangkaraw kerkuok pali a sut bawk a."
37,"And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer;","Puon in kawtkhâra ding chun puonzâr, sahmul dumpâwl, a êm, a seninlâr le puonzai inhmi kawp, a ṭhuia ṭhuimawia chei chu a siem a;"
38,and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of brass.,"a ban panga le a kuoikimhai leh. An lubâwkhai le an tuom mawinahai chu rângkachak ân luon khum a, an inṭhutna panga ruok chu dârsen an nih."
