1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,","Aigupta rama chun LALPAIN Mosie le Aron kuoma chun a hril a,"
2,This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.,"“Hi thla hi in ta dingin thla inṭanna ning a ta, in ta dingin kum khata thla hmasatak ning a tih."
3,"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household:","Israel mi inkhâwmhai po po lai chun hril unla, ‘hi thla ni sâwm ni tak hin, mi tinin an pahnamhai ang peiin berâmte pakhat, sûng khat ta dingin berâmte pakhat la seng raw hai se:"
4,"and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man’s eating ye shall make your count for the lamb.","chun, sûng khat chu berâmte pakhat ta dinga an tlâwm talaw chun ama le a dawttu chun berâmte pa- khat, a mi tamzie ang peiin hmang an ta, mi tin ifâk tâwk ang peiin berâmte chu tiem in tih."
5,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:","In berâmte chu a chal kum khat mi, demkailo a ni ding a nih, kêl ruol laia inthawkin, annawleh, berâm ruol laia inthawkin la tum in tih,"
6,and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even.,chu thla ni sâwm pali chen chun kawl in tih: Israel mi inkhâwmhai po po chun zântieng chun that in tih.
7,"And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it.","Chun, a thisen chu lâng an ta, an fâkna ding in kawtkhâr bieng ve ve le kawtkhâr lu khang pheiah nâl an tih."
8,"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it.","Chu zân chun a sa chu meia rawin, chawl ṭhanglo bei leh fâng an ta; hlohna kha leh fâng an tih."
9,"Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof.","A selin amanih, tuia suongin amanih fa naw unla, em hmin lem ro; a lu le a kehai le a sûnghai le chun."
10,And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.,Zîngkâr chena dingin a ieng- khawm in hla ding a ni nawh; zîngkâr chena um zing taphawt chu meiin raw hmang in tih.
11,"And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah’s passover.","Chun, hieng ang hin fâng in tih: in dier kei sa zingin, in kekawk bun sa zingin le, in kuta in hmawl chawi sa zingin, inhmâwtakin in fâk ding a nih. LALPA Fekân Ruoiṭhe a nih."
12,"For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Jehovah.","Chu zân chun Aigupta ram fe thleng ka ta, ran le mihriem khawm, Aigupta rama nau lutîr po po chu ka sukhlum ding a ni sih a; chun, Aigupta mihai pathienhai chunga khawm rorêlnahai intlungtir bawk ka tih, LALPA chu ka ni hi!"
13,"And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.","Chun, thisen chu in ta dingin in umna inhai inchikna nîng a ta; thisen chu ka hmu pha chun, nangni chu fekân ka ti cheu a, Aigupta ram ka hung hrem lai khawm chun, nangni sukbohmang ding cheuin in chungah hri hrim hrim um naw nih."
14,"And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.","Hi ni hi in ta dingin hriet zingna nîng a ta, LALPA kuomah ruoiṭhena nei hlak in tih: in thlahai chenin, kumkhuoin dân angin hi ruoiṭhena hi nei zing in tih."
15,"Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.","Ni sari sûng chu chawl ṭhanglo bei in fâk ding a na, ni khat niha inthawk khawmin in inhaia in- thawkin chawl sie hmang vawng in ta; ni khat niha inthawka ni sari ni chen chun mi tukhawmin chawl ṭhang bei a fâk chun, chu mi chu Israel mihaia inthawka sâtthlâk a ni ding a ni sih a."
16,"And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.","Ni khat ni chun in ta dingin inkhâwmpui inthieng um a ta, ni sari ni khawmin inkhâwmpui inthieng um bawk a tih; chuong nihaia chun sin iengkhawm in thaw ding a ni nawh, mi tinin fâk rawngbâwl ruok chu thaw thei in tih."
17,And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever.,"Chawl ṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe chu inser in ta, chu ni le le chun in mihai chu Aigupta rama inthawkin ka ṭhuoi suok a ni sih a; chuleiin, kumkhaw dâna neiin, hi ni hi in thlahai chenin inser in tih."
18,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.","Thla hmasatakah, chu thla ni sâwm le pali ni zântiengah chawl ṭhanglo bei in fâk ding a nih, chu thla ma ni sâwm hni pakhat ni zântieng chenin."
19,"Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land.","Ni sari sûng chu chawl hrim hrim in inhaiah hmu a ni ding a ni nawh: mi tukhawm chawl ṭhang bei fatu chu, mikhuol khawm, a rama pieng khawm, chu mi chu Israel mi- puihai laia inthawka sât thlâk nîng a tih."
20,Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.,"Chawl ṭhang hrim hrim chu iengkhawm in fâk ding a ni nawh; in umna taphawthaia chun chawl ṭhanglo bei in fâk ding a nih,’ tiin hril rawh,” tiin."
21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover.","Chun Mosie chun Israel upahai po po chu a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, “Fe suok unla, in sûngkaw tamzie ang peiin berâmte la unla, fekân ruoi dingin that ro."
22,"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.","Hussop bâwr la unla, thlênga thisena chun inchie unla, chu thlênga thisen chun kawtkhâr bieng pahnihai le kawtkhâr lu chung khangphei chu nâl ro: chun, zîngkâr a ni hmakhat chu tukhawm a in kawtkhâra chun suok hlek naw raw se."
23,"For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.","Aigupta mihai chu hrem dingin LALPA chu a fe thleng ding a ni sih a; chun, kawtkhâr bieng pahni le kawtkhâr lu chung khangpheia thi- sen chu a hmu chun, LALPA chun kawtkhâr chu fe kân a ta, in inhaia chun nangni sukhlum ding cheuin sukbohmangtu chu inhungtir naw nih."
24,And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.,Hi thil hi dâna neiin nangni le in thlahai chenin kumkhuoin inser in tih.
25,"And it shall come to pass, when ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.","Chun, a thutiem anga, LALPA- IN ram a pêk ding cheu in tlung pha khawm, hi rawngbâwlna sin hi in vawn zing ding a nih."
26,"And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?","Chun, in nauhaiin, ‘Hi rawng- bâwlna hi a umzie ieng am a na?’ an ti pha cheu chun,"
27,"that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah’s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.","‘Aigupta mihai a sukhlum a, ei inhai a sanhim laia, Aigupta rama Israel thlahai inhai fekântu, LALPA Fekân inthawina chu a nih,’ tîng in tih,” a tih a. Mipui chun an lu an suk a, chibai an bûk tah a."
28,"And the children of Israel went and did so; as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.","Chun, Israel thlahai chu an feh a, LALPAIN Mosie le Aron thu a pêk ang ngei chun an thaw tah a."
29,"And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.","Zânril lai takah LALPA chun Aigupta rama nau lutîr po po, Pharao nau lutîr a lalṭhungphaa ṭhunga inthawka sal lung ina intâng nau lutîr chen le, ran ruol tê hmasatakhai chen chun a hung sukhlum ta vawng a."
30,"And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.","Zâna chun Pharao le a sie- hlawhai le Aigupta mi po pohai chu an tho a, Aiguptaa chun ṭap nasatak el chu a um tah a: in tin el chu mithi um nawna hrim a um si nawh a."
31,"And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.","Azân azânin Mosie le Aron chu a ko a, “Tho unla, Israel thlahai le chun ka mihaia inthawkin fe hmang dai ro; chuongchun, fe unla, in ti ta angin LALPA rawng chu va bâwl ro."
32,"Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.","In ti ta angin in bâwng ruolhai le in berâm ruolhai chu ṭhuoi unla, fe vak ro khai; chun, kei khawm mal mi sâwmpêk bawk unla,” a tih a."
33,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.","Aigupta mihai chun Israel mihai chu inhmâwtaka suok dingin an nawr sek sek a, “Ei thi zo vawng ding an ta hi,” an ti leiin."
34,"And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.","Chuongchun, Israel mihai chu an bei hmetna thlênghai chu puona tuoma an liengkohaia putin an beihai chu chawl phul loin an chawi tah a."
35,"And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:","Israel thlahai chun Mosie thu ang pei chun an thawh a; Aigupta mihai chu silfên le, rângkachak le tangkaraw incheinahai an hni tâwl a;"
36,"and Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.","chuongchun, LALPAIN Israel mihai chu Aigupta mihai mithmua chun ditsakna ân hmutir a, an hni taphawt chu an pêk pei el a. Chuong ang chun Aigupta mihai chu an suksiet tah a."
37,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.","Israel thlahai, naupangnawi tiem loa puitling ruok khawm nuoi ruk lai chu Ramesesa inthawkin Sukkoth chen kein an fe tah a."
38,"And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.",Mi chilak tamtak khawm anni leh an hang fe veh a; bâwng ruol le berâm ruol le ran ruol tamtak leh.
39,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.","Aiguptaa inthawka beihlawm an hung chawihai chu chawl ṭhanglo beiphêkhaiah an zeu a, chawl ṭhanglo a ni hrim a; Aiguptaa inthawk a nama nam suok el an ni leiin le an muong thei ta naw leiin fâk ding iengkhawm an inbuotsai si nawh a."
40,Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.,"Israel thlahai thang sung, Aiguptaa an thang sung chu kum za li sawmthum a nih."
41,"And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.","Kum za li le sawmthum tâwpah, chu ni le le chun LALPA mipuihai chu Aigupta rama inthawkin an fe suok tah a."
42,"It is a night to be much observed unto Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.",Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suok dinga LALPAIN a vêng tlat zân chu a nih: chu zân chu a nih Israel thlahaiin an thlahai nâwksâwng chen khawma LALPA ta dinga an inser tlat ding chu.
43,"And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no foreigner eat thereof;","LALPA chun Mosie le Aron kuomah, “Fekân Ruoi dân ding chu hi hi a nih: ram dang mi chun a fâk ve ding a ni nawh:"
44,"but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.","amiruokchu, siehlaw tukhawm tangka suma inchâwk tah, ama chu sertanpêk tah a ni bawk chun fa vêng a tih."
45,A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.,"Khuolchâm amanih, inhlawfa siehlaw tukhawmin chu chu fa thei naw nih."
46,In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.,"In khata fâk ding a nih a, a sa a iengkhawm tuolah in chawi dawk ding a ni nawh, a ru khawm in sukthliek hlek ding a ni nawh."
47,All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.,Israel mipuihai chun hi hi an zâwm tlat ding a nih.
48,"And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.","Hnam dang mi nang le fe ve a um a, LALPA kuoma Fekân Ruoi a hmang ve ding chun, pasalhai po chu an ser intantir la, chun, hung hnai sienla, hmang raw se: chun ama chu chu rama pieng ang bawk chu nîng a tih, a ram mi hrim ang nîng a tih. Sertanlo mi ruok chun, chu chu a fâk ding a ni nawh."
49,"One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.","A ram mi hrim le hnam dang mi nangni laia khuolchâm ta ding khawmin dân pakhat chau a um,” a tih a."
50,"Thus did all the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.",Hieng ang hin Israel thlahai po po chun an thawh a; LALPAIN Mosie le Aron thu a pêk ang ngeiin an thawh a.
51,"And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.",Chu ni ngei chun LALPA chun Israel thlahai chu an pâwl ruol ang peiin Aigupta rama inthawk a ṭhuoi suok tah a.
