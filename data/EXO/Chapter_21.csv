1,Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them.,“Hienghai hi an kuoma i pêk ding dânhai chu an nih:
2,"If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.","Hebrai siehlaw în châwk chun, kum ruk sûng i rawngbâwl a ta; a kum sarinaa chun iengkhawm ngai loin, a thlâwnin suok el a tih."
3,"If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.","Ama khâta hung lût a ni chun, ama khâtin suok nâwk el a ta; nuhmei nei tah a ni chun a nuhmei khawm ama leh suok vêng a tih."
4,"If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.","A hotupa chun nuhmei a pêk a, a nuhmei chun naupasalhai le naunu- hmeihai a neipêk chun,nuhmei le a nauhai chu a hotupa ta nîng an ta; ama khâtin suok el a tih."
5,"But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:","Nisienlakhawm, siehlaw chun, Ka hotupa, ka nuhmei le ka nauhai ka hmangai a, zalêna um dingin suok da el ka tih, a ti chun:"
6,"then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.","a hotupa chun Pathien kuomah hung ṭhuoi a ta, kawtkhâr bienga manih, kawtkhâra manih hung ṭhuoi a ta; a hotupa chun a nakâwr chu thîr zumin ver tlang a ta, kumkhuoin ama rawng chu bâwl tâng a tih."
7,"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.","“Miin a naunuhmei siehlawnu ni dinga a zawr chun, siehlawpahai suok angin chu minu chu suok thei naw nih."
8,"If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.","A hotupa a suklungawi nawh a, ama chun nei dinga a huol naw chun, intlanin inumtir a tih: amânu chu indiklotaka a lo thaw tâk leiin, ram dang mi kuoma zawr sâwng dingin thuneina nei thei naw nih."
9,"And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.","A naupa nuhmei dinga a huol a ni chun, ama chu naunuhmeihai ang bawkin a thaw ding a nih."
10,"If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.","Nuhmei dang ân neitir chun, a bu, a silfên le inneinaa a chan chu a suktlâwmpêk chuong ding a ni nawh."
11,"And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.","Hi thil pathum hi chu minu chunga a thaw naw chun, tangka loin, iengkhawm ngai loin fe suok el a tih."
12,"He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.","“Miin mi dang a vuok a, a thi chun, ama khawm chu sukhlum ngei ding a nih."
13,"And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.","Nisienlakhawm, tum hrimnaa inchân lei ni lo a, Pathienin ama chu a kuta a pêk hrim a ni chun, tlân hmangna ding hmun ruotpêk ka ti che."
14,"And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.","Miin a vênghai tum hrimnaa hlêma sukhlum tuma a thaw ruok chun, ama chu sukhlum dingin ka mâichâma inthawkin ṭhuoi hmang i tih."
15,"And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.","“Tukhawm a nu manih, a pa manih vawtu chu sukhlum ngei ding a nih."
16,"And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.","“Tukhawm mihriem inru chu, a zawr khawmin, amain a umpui a ni khawmin, ama chu sukhlum ngei ding a nih."
17,"And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.","“Tukhawm a pa manih, a nu manih ṭawngsieinphurtu chu sukhlum ngei ding a nih."
18,"And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;","Mi insuol hai sienla, mi pakhat- in mi dang lunga dêngin amanih, a kuttumin amanih chum sienla, ama chu thi loin, tho kâng pei loin zâl el sienla;"
19,"if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.","a hung tho nâwk a, hmawl ṭhuna a lâwn thei chun, a vawtu chu insuo phawt ding a nih; a hun sukhmang ai chu thung a ta, a dam var chenin enkawl a tih."
20,"And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.","“Miin a siehlawpa amanih, a siehlawnu amanih hmawlin vaw sien, thi dêr sienla, ama chu hrem ngei ding a nih."
21,"Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.","Nisienlakhawm, ni khat am- anih, ni hni amanih a la dam chun, ama chu hrem ding a ni nawh; siehlaw chu a tangka a ni leiin."
22,"And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.","“Mi an insuol a, nuhmei nau vawn a suknah a, a nau chu a tla chun, sietnain hung zui kher naw sien khawm, chu nuhmeinu pasalin a chunga a phût zât ang ang chu inchawitir ngei ding a nih: chun, rorêltuhaiin ṭha an ti ang chu a pêk ding a nih."
23,"But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,","Sietnain a hung zui hlau ruok chun hringna aiah hringna,"
24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,","mit aiah mit, ha aiah ha, kut aiah kut, ke aiah ke,"
25,"burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.","raw aiah raw, sukhliem aiah sukhliem, vuok aiah vuok pe ve thung i tih."
26,"And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.","“Miin a siehlawpa mit amanih, a siehlawnu mit amanih a vuok a, a suksiet chun, a mit lei chun ama chu iengkhawm ngai loin insuoktir el a tih."
27,"And if he smite out his man-servant’s tooth, or his maid-servant’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.","A siehlawpa ha amanih, a siehlawnu ha amanih a vuok thlawng chun, a ha lei chun iengkhawm ngai loin insuoktir el a tih."
28,"And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.","“Bâwngchalin pasal amanih, nuhmei a sik a, a thi chun, chu bâwngchal chu lunga dêng hlum ngei ding a na, a sa chu fâk a ni ding a ni nawh; bâwngchal neitu ruok chu fihlîm a tih."
29,"But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.","Nisienlakhawm, bâwngchal chu a hma khawmin mi sik hmangtak lo ni tahin, a neitu khawm chu inhriet- tir lo ni ta bawk sienla, ama chun a inah a thlung nawh a, pasal amanih, nuhmei a sukhlum a ni chun, a neitu chu sukhlum nîng a ta, bâwgchal khawm chu dêng hlum ni bawk a tih."
30,"If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.","Ama chu intlanna phût a ni chun, a hringna ta dinga intlanna a kuoma phût ang taphawt chu pêng a tih."
31,"Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.","Naupa amanih, naunu sik a ni khawmin hi dân bawk hi a chungah hmang nîng a tih."
32,"If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.","Bâwngchalin siehlawpa am- anih, siehlawnu a sik chun, a neitu chun an hotupa kuoma chun shekel tangka sâwmthum pêng a ta, chun, bâwngchal chu dêng hlum nîng a tih."
33,"And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,","“Miin khur hawngin amanih, miin khur choin nel nâwk naw sienla, chutaka chun sabengtung amanih, bâwngchal tla ta sienla,"
34,"the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead beast shall be his.","a khur neitu chun thung a ta; a ran neitu kuoma chun tangka pêng a ta, ran thi chu ama ta ni tâng a tih."
35,"And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it; and the dead also they shall divide.","“Mi pakhat bâwngchalin mi dang bâwngchal suknain lo thi ta sienla, bâwngchal la dam chu zawr an ta, a man chu insem an tih; chun, a thi khawm chu insem bawk an tih."
36,"Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his own.","Bâwngchal chu a hma khawma mi sik hmang a ni ti hriet sa a ni ruok chun, a neituin a inah a thlung naw a ni chun, bâwngchal aia chun bâwngchal ma a pêk ngei ding a nih; chun, ran thi chu ama ta ni tâng a tih."
