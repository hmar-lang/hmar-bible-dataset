1,"Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.","Chun, Jethro, Midian mihai thiempu, Mosie tarpupa chun Mosie le a mi Israelhai ta dinga Pathienin thil a thawpêkzie, Ai- guptaa inthawkin Israelhai chu LALPAIN a hung ṭhuoi suokzie chu a lo hriet a."
2,"And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,","Chun, Jethro, Mosie tarpupa chun, Mosie nuhmei, Zippora, a itirhmang ta hnung le,"
3,"and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:","a naupasalhai pahni chu a ṭhuoi a; chuhai pakhat hming chu Gersom a nih, “Hrietlo rama inzin ka ni tah a” a ti sih a:"
4,"and the name of the other was Eliezer; for he said, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.","Chun, a dang hming chu Eliezer a nih, “Ka thlatu Pathien chu ka ṭhangpuitu a na, Pharao kâwlhnâma inthawkin a mi sansuok tah a” a ti bawk a."
5,"And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God:","Chun, Jethro, Mosie tarpupa chu, a naupasalhai le, a nuhmei leh Mosie kuomah, thlalêra a riebûk, Pathien tlânga chun a hung a."
6,"and he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.","Ama chun Mosie kuomah, “Kei i tarpupa Jethro hi, i nuhmei le a naupasalhai pahni le chun i kuomah ka hung a nih,” tiin thu ân chah a."
7,"And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.","Mosie chu a tarpupa tuok ding chun a fe suok a, inza taka chibai bûkin ama a fâwp tah a; chun, an chanchin an indawntuo an indawn- tuoh a, puon ina chun an lût tah a."
8,"And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.","Mosie chun, Israelhai leia Pharao chunga le Aigupta mihai chunga LALPA thil thaw ta po pohai, lampuia an chunga rimsikna hung tlunghai le, LALPAIN anni a san- suokzie chu, a tarpupa Jethro chu a hril tah a."
9,"And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.","Aigupta mihai kuta inthawka sansuokin, Israelhai chunga LALPAIN thilṭha a thaw po pohai chunga chun Jethro chu a lâwm hleh a."
10,"And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.","Jethro chun, “Aigupta mihai kuta inthawk le, Pharao kuta inthawka sansuoktu cheu LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se; Aigupta mihai kuta inthawka a mihai sansuoktu chu."
11,"Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.","Tuhin pathienhai po po nêkin LALPA chu a ropui lem ti ka hriet, chapotaka anni an sawisak lai ngeia Aigupta mihai kut hnuoia inthawk- a a mihai chu a sansuok leiin,” a tih a."
12,"And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.","Chun, Mosie tarpupa Jethro chun inthâwinahai le pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai Pathien ta dingin a lâk a; chun Aron chu Israel upahai po po leh Pathien hmaha Mosie tarpupa le bei fa dingin an hung tah a."
13,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening.",A zînga chun Mosie chu mipui ro rêlpêk dingin a ṭhung a; mipui chu zîngkâra inthawk zântieng chenin Mosie vêla chun an ngîr tah a.
14,"And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?","Mosie tarpupa chun mipui kuoma a thilthaw po po chu a hmu chun, “Mipui ta dinga i thaw hi ieng thil am a na? Iem a tiha nang i khât bakin în ṭhung a, mipui chu i vêlah zîngkâra inthawk zântieng chena an ngîr hi?” a tih a."
15,"And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:","Mosie chun a tarpupa kuomah, “Mipui chu Pathien ti zâwng indawn dinga ka kuoma an hung leiin a nih."
16,"when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.","Thubuoi an nei pha ka kuomah an hung a; chun, a vênghai le mi dang kâra thu chu ka rêl a, Pathien dân ziekhai le a dânhai chu ka lo inhriettir hlak a nih,” a tih a."
17,"And Moses’ father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.","Mosie tarpupa chun a kuomah, “Hi thil i thaw hi a ṭha naw ie."
18,"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.",Nang le i kuoma mipui umhai hi lân sukchâu ngei ngei in tih; i ta dingin hi thil hi a rik talaw sih a; nanga khât bak chun i thaw thei nawh annawm.
19,"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:","Tuhin, ka thu hi lo ngâi ta, thurawn hang pêng ka ti che: Pathien chu i kuomah um sienla, Pathien hmaah nang chu mipui aiawtu ni la; nangin Pathien hmaah thubuoi chu intlun pei bawk la:"
20,"and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.","chun, dân ziekhai le dânhai chu anni inchûktir i ta, an sin thaw dinghai le, kawng an hraw ding chu anni kâwkhmu bawk i ta."
21,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:","Chunawa khawm mipui laia inthawk mi thei thei, Pathien ṭi mi, mi indikhai, hlêpna felnaw theida mihai thlang suok la, anni chu sâng khat chunga rorêltu, za khat chunga rorêltu, sâwmnga chunga rorêltu, sâwm chunga rorêltuhai ni dingin sie rawh."
22,"and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.","Ieng lai khawmin anni chu mipui ro chu inrêltir la, thubuoi lien takhai bak hung intlun an ta, thubuoi chînhai chu annîn lo rêl el an ta; chuongchun, i ta dingin awl lem a ta, i rikphur chu an phurpui ding che annawm."
23,"If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.","Pathienin hieng angtaka thu a pêk cheha, hi thil hi i thaw chun, nang khawmin pei sâwt i ta, mipui po po khawm hi an hmun sengah thlamuongtakin fêng an tih,” a tih a."
24,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.","Mosie chun a tarpupa thu chu a ngai a, a hril po po chu a thaw tah a."
25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.","Mosie chun Israel mihai laia inthawkin mi thei deu deu a thlang suok a, anni chu mipui luhai ni dingin, sânghai, zahai, sâwmngahai le sâwmhai chunga rorêltuhaiah a sie tah a."
26,"And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.","Anni chun ieng huna khawm mipui ro chu an rêlpêk a, thubuoi intakhai chu Mosie kuomah an hung intlun a, thubuoi chînhai ruok chu annîn an lo rêl tah a."
27,And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.,"Chun, Mosie chun a tarpupa chu ân fetir a; a umna ram tieng chun a fe tah a."
