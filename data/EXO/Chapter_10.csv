1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Pharao kuomah va lût la, hieng ka inchiknahai hi anni lai ngeia kân entir theina dingin a siehlawhai le ama lungril ngei khawm chu ka sukngar tah a nih;"
2,"and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am Jehovah.","anni lai ngeia inchikna ka thawhai le, Aigupta mihai chu ieng angin am an chungah thil ka thawha ti i naupa le i tupa hrieta ngei khawm i hril theina dingin le; LALPA chu ka ni ngei ti i hriet theina dingin, ti rawh,” a tih a."
3,"And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.","Chun, Mosie le Aron chu Pharao kuomah an va lût a, a kuomah, “Hebraihai Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ‘Ka hmaa insiehnuoi ieng chen am i nuom naw ding a nih a? Ka rawng an bâwl theina dingin ka mihai chu infetir rawh."
4,"Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:","Ka mihai în fetir phal naw chun, ngai rawh, i ram sûngah, zinga leh khâuhai hung ṭhuoi ka ta;"
5,"and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:","hnuoi chung po po chu a dâpin hung dâp an ta, hnuoi chu mi hmu theilo khawp hielin um a tih. Riel isuksietnaa i la chang a mahla la umhai chu fa vawng an ta, i ta dinga loa thing mâwng tinrênghai khawm chu fa vawng bawk an tih."
6,"and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.","I inhai le i siehlaw po po inhai le Aigupta mi po po inhai chu sip vawng an ta, i pahai le i thlatuhai khawmin, hi hnuoi chunga an uma inthawk vawisûn ni chen hin chuong ang chu la hmu ngai naw bawk an tih,’ a tih,” a tih a. Chun ân her a, Pharao kuoma inthawk chun a fe suok tah a."
7,"And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?","Chun, Pharao siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Hi mipa hi ei ta dingin ieng chen am châng a ni ding a ni leh? An Pathien LALPA chu a rawng an bâwlpêk theina dingin mihai chu infetir ta la: Aigupta hi suksiet vawng a ni tah ti hi i la hriet naw rawp am a nih?” an tih a."
8,"And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they that shall go?","Chun, Mosie le Aron chu Pharao kuomah an hung ṭhuoi nâwk a, ama chun an kuomah, “Fe unla, in Pathien LALPA rawng chu va bâwl ro le; amiruokchu, a fe ding chu tu tuhai am an nih a?” a tih a."
9,"And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah.","Mosie chun, “LALPA kuoma chun ruoi kan ṭhe ding a ni sih a, kan naupanghai le kan tarhai leh, kan naupasalhai kan naunuhmeihai leh, kan bâwng ruolhai le kan berâm ruolhai leh fêng kan tih,” a tih a."
10,"And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.","Pharao chun, “LALPA chu in kuomah um raw se; nangni le in nauhai le chu kân fetir tâk cheu leh! En ta u, thiltum ṭhanawtak in nei a ni hi."
11,"Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve Jehovah; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.","Chuong chu ni thei naw nih, mi puitling bak va fe unla, LALPA rawng chu va bâwl ro: chu chu in nuomtak a ni sih a,” a tih a. Chun, Pharao hmaha inthawk chun hnawt hmangin an um tah a."
12,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Khâuhai hungna dingin Aigupta ram chungah i bân phar rawh; Aigupta rama an hung a, a rama hna hring tinrêng, rielin a suksiet mahla chu an fâk vawngna dingin,” a tih a."
13,"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun Aigupta ram chunga chun a hmawl chu ân let tah a; chun, LALPA chun chu ni sûnnithlak le zânkhawvârin ram chunga chun sak thli ân hrângtir a; chun, zîngtieng a hung ni chun, sak thli chun khâuhai chu a hung lên tah a."
14,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.","Khâuhai chu Aigupta ram po po chunga chun an hung a, Aigupta ram sûng po poa chun an um khup el tah a; a râpthlâk bêk a, anni hma hin anni ang hrim hin khau an la um ngai nawh a, anni hnunga khawm um ngai ta bawk nawng an tih."
15,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.","A ram pumpui chu an dâp khup el sih a, ram chu ân thim khup el bawk a; rama hna hring tinrêng le, thing rahai, riel ihlahai chu an fâk ta ngei a; Aigupta ram pumpuia chun loa thlaihna, thing le thil a hring hrim a um ta dêr nawh a."
16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.","Chun Pharao chun Mosie le Aron chu inhmawtakin a ko a, “Nang le in Pathien LALPA chunga chun thil ka suksuol tah a nih."
17,"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may take away from me this death only.","Tuhin ka ngên che hi, ka suol hi vawikhat bak mi ngaidam nâwk phawt la, hi thina hi keimaa in- thawka a lâkhmang theina dingin LALPA chu mi hnipêk rawh,” a tih a."
18,"And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.","Pharao kuoma inthawk chu a fe suok a, LALPA chu a hni tah a."
19,"And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.","LALPA chun khâuhai po po chu lêna, Tuipui Sena khal lût vawngtu, thlang tieng thli hrâttak el chu ân hrângtir tah a, Aigupta ram po poa chun khâu pakhat khawm a um ta nawh a."
20,"But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun Pharao lungril chu a sukngar a, Israel thlahai chu ân fetir chuong nawh."
21,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Aigupta ram chunga inthimna, in- maia inmaina khawp hielin inthimna a hung um theina dingin i bân phar rawh,” a tih a."
22,And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;,"Chun, Mosie chun vân tieng a bân a phar a; chuongchun, ni thum sûng chu Aigupta ram sûng po poa chun inthim sa mup el chu a um tah a;"
23,"they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.","chu ni thum sûng chun tu- khawm an hmuna inthawkin an suok nawh a, inhmu khawm an inhmutuo thei bawk nawh; Israel thlahai po ruok chun an umnahaia chun var an nei seng a."
24,"And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.","Chun, Pharao chun Mosie a ko a, “Fe unla, LALPA rawng chu va bâwl ro; in nauhai khawm in ruolin fe ve hai sienla, in berâm ruolhai le in bâwng ruolhai ruok chu mâksan ro,” a tih a."
25,"And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God.","Mosie ruok chun, “Kan Pathien LALPA kuoma kan inthâwi theina dingin, pumrawhmang thilinhlân dinghai le inthâwina dinghai chu kan kutah i mi pêk ding a nih."
26,"Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come thither.","Kan ran ruolhai khawm keini leh an fe ve ding a nih, ran tê pakhat khawm mâksan an ni ding a ni nawh a; kan Pathien LALPA rawng kan bâwlna dingin kan ṭhuoi ve ngei ding a nih; a hmun kan tlung hmakhat chu ieng hmangin am LALPA rawng chu kan bâwl ding a nih ti kan hriet si nawh a,” a tih a."
27,"But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.","Nisienlakhawm, Pharao lungril chu LALPAIN a sukngar a, anni chu ân fetir chuong nawh a."
28,"And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.","Pharao chun a kuomah, “Ka kuoma inthawkin fe hmang la, ka hmêl hrim hrim hung hmu nâwk ta lo dingin fîmkhur rawh, ka hmêl i hmu nâwk ni ni chun i thi ngei ding a ni sih a,” a tih a."
29,"And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.","Mosie chun, “I ti ṭha ngawt el ie, i hmêl hmu nâwk hrim hrim ta naw ning,” a tih a."
