1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.","Chun Levi sûnghai laia mi pakhat chu a feh a, Levi naunu nuhmeiin a nei tah a."
2,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.","Nuhmei chu ân rai a, naupasal a hung nei a; naupang hmêl ṭhatak a nih ti a hmuin thla thum a thup- hmang a."
3,"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.","Chun, ama chu a thuphmang zing thei naw phingleh phairuong lawng a lâk a, fâr hnai le lawng hnaiin a zût a; chu sûnga chun nau- pang chu a sieh a, vadung sîra phairuonghai lai chun a sie tah a."
4,"And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.",Ama chu iengtin am a um pei ti hre dingin a farnu chu hla fea hin a ngir a.
5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.","Chun Pharao naunu chu va- dunga insil dingin a hung thlah a; a nunghâkhai chu vadung pang hrûla chun an fe vêl a; phairuong- hai laia lawng chu a hmu tah a, nunghâk pakhat chu va la dingin a tir a."
6,"And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.","A hang hawng chun nautê chu a hmuh a: chun, ngai ta, nautê chu a ṭap tah a. Ama chu a lunginsiet a, “Hi hi Hebrai nauhai laia pakhat chu a ni ngei el,” a tih a."
7,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?","Chun a farnu chun Pharao naunu kuomah, “Fêng ka ta, Hebrai nuhmei naudawntu, hi nautê dawnpêktu ding che hi ka va kopêk ding che am a nih?” a tih a."
8,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child’s mother.","Pharao naunu chun a kuomah, “Va fe rawh,” a tih a. Chun nunghâk chu a feh a, naupang nu ngei chu a va ko tah a."
9,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.","Chun, Pharao naunu chun a kuomah, “Hi naupang hi la la; ka ta dingin dawn rawh; chun, i hlaw tâwk pêng ka ti che,” a tih a."
10,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.","Chun, nuhmei chun naupang chu a lâk a, a dawn tah a. Naupang chu a hung inṭhang lien a, Pharao naunu kuomah a hung ṭhuoi a, a naupa a hung ni tah a. Chun, “Tuia inthawka ka lâk suok a nih a” tiin a hmingah Mosie a sak a."
11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.","Mosie chu a hung puitling a, ni khat chu a unauhai kuomah a fe tah a; an rikphurhai chu a hmuh a: chun, a unauhai laia mi pakhat, Hebrai mi, Aigupta miin a vuok a hmuh a."
12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.","Chun, a ngha vêl a ngha vêl a, mi tukhawm an um nawh ti a hmu phingin Aigupta mi chu a vuok hlum a, phaiphinah a thuphmang tah a."
13,"And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?","A ni hninaa a va fe suok nâwk chun, ngai ta, Hebrai mi pahni an lo insuol a; ama chun a thil suksuoltu lem kuoma chun, “Iengdinga i unau i vuok am a na?” a tih a."
14,"And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Kan chungah lal le rorêltuin tuin am a siem cheh a? Aigupta mi i that ang khan kei khawm hi mi that i tum a ni maw?” a tih a. Chun, Mosie chu a ṭi tah a, “Hi thil hi hriet suokin a um chie tah a ni hi,” a tih a."
15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.","Pharao chun chu thil chu a hriet phingleh, Mosie chu sukhlum dingin a zawng tah a. Nisienlakhawm, Mosie chu Pharao hmaa inthawk a tlân hmang a, Midian ramah a um ta zing a; chun, tuisunsuo sîrah a ṭhung tah a."
16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.","Midian mihai thiempu chun naunuhmei pasari a nei a; anni chu an hung a, tui an chawi a, an pa berâm ruol chu tui pe dingin tuibêlhai chu an thâl sip a."
17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.","Chun, berâmpuhai chu an hung a, anni chu an hnawt hmang tah a; nisienlakhawm, Mosie chu a ngîr a, anni a ṭhangpui a, an berâm ruol chu tui ân dâwntir tah a."
18,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?","An pa Reuel kuomah an hung chun, “Iengtizie am a na vawisûn chu in va hung inhma de?” a lo tih a."
19,"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.","Anni chun, “Aigupta mi pakhat- in berâmpuhai kuta inthawk a mi sansuok tâwl a nih, chu bak khawm chu ni loin tui a mi chawipêk a, kan berâm ruol tui ân dâwntir bawk a,” an tih a."
20,"And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.","Ama chun a naunuhai kuomah, “Anleh ama chu khâwlai am a um a? chu mipa chu iengdinga in hung mâksan am? Bei fa dingin ama chu hung ko ro,” a tih a."
21,And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.,"Chun, Mosie chu chu mipa kuoma um ding chun ân sukthlûk tah a; ama chun a naunu Zippora chu Mosie a pêk a."
22,"And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.","Zippora chun naupasal a nei a. Mosie chun, “Hrietlo rama inzin ka ni tah a,” a tih a, a hmingah Gersom a sak tah a."
23,"And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.","Chuong ni tamtak sûng chun Aigupta lal chu a thi tah a. Israel thlahai chu an intângna lei chun an thuok a dawng hleh a, Pathien an ko a, an intângna leia ama an kona chun Pathien kuom a tlung tah a."
24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.","Pathienin an inrûm chu a hriet a, Abraham, Isak le Jakob kuoma a thuthlung chu Pathienin a hriet zing a."
25,"And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge of them.","Chun, Israel thlahai chu Pathien chun a hmuh a, anni chu a hriet zing bawk a."
