1,"Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb.","Mosie chun a tarpupa Jethro, Midian mihai thiempupa berâm ruol chu a enkawl a: chun, berâm ruol chu thlalêr tlâktieng pangah a ṭhuoi a, Pathien tlâng Horeba chun a hung a."
2,"And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.","Chun, Lalpa vântirko, chîm- bukah mei chawkin a kuomah a hung inlâr a; a en a, chîmbuk meia chawk zur zura a chîmbuk chu kâng hmang si lo chu a hmuh a."
3,"And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.","Mosie chun, “Tuhin va hnai ka ta, hi thilhmu ropuitak hin chîmbuk hi iengtizieha kâng hmang lo el am a nih va en ka tih,” a tih a."
4,"And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.","LALPA chun chu en dinga a va hnai a hmu chun, chîmbuk laia inthawk chun Pathienin ama chu a hung ko a, “Mosie, Mosie,” a tih a."
5,"And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.","Ama chun, “Hitaka hi ka um,” a tih a. Pathien chun a kuomah, “Hi tieng hi hung hnai naw rawh: i kephaha inthawkin i kekawkhai kha hlîp rawh; i ngîrna hmun kha hnuoi inthieng a ni sih a,” a tih a."
6,"Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.","Chu nawa khawm, “I thlatu Pathien, Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien le, Jakob Pathien ka nih,” a tih a. Chun, Mosie chun Pathien chu a en ngam nawh a, a hmai a thup tah a."
7,"And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;","Chun LALPA chun, “Aiguptaa ka mihai rimsikzie chu feltakin ka hmuh a, an sinthaw hotuhai sukrimsikna leia an khêkri khawm chu ka hriet a, an tuornahai chu ka hriet a,"
8,"and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.","chuleiin, Aigupta mihai kuta inthawka anni sansuok ding le, chu rama inthawka, Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Amor mihai, Periz mihai, Hiv mihai le Jebus mihai hmun, ram lien le ram ṭha, khuoizu le nenetui luong rama ṭhuoi lût dinga hung thla ka nih."
9,"And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.","Chuongchun, tuhin, ngai ta, Israel mihai khêkri chu ka kuom a hung tlung a, chu nâksapah nêksâwr an nina, Aigupta mihaiin an nêksawrna chu ka hmu zing bawk a."
10,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.","Chuleiin, hung ta, Israel thla- hai chu Aiguptaa inthawka i hung ṭhuoi suok theina dingin Pharao kuomah tir ka ti che,” a tih a."
11,"And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?","Mosie ruok chun Pathien kuomah, “Tu am ka nih a, Pharao kuoma ka feh a, Israel thlahai Aiguptaa inthawk ka hung ṭhuoi suok el ding chu?” a tih a."
12,"And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.","Ama chun, “I kuomah um ngei ngei ka tih, chun, ka tir che a nih ti inchikna chu hi hi nîng a tih: Aiguptaa inthawka Israel mihai i hung ṭhuoi suok pha, hi tlâng chunga hin Pathien rawng la bâwl in tih, ti hi,” a tih a."
13,"And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?","Mosie chun Pathien kuomah, “Ngai ta, Israel thlahai kuom ka va tlunga an kuomah, ‘In thlatuhai Pathien chun in kuomah a mi hung tir a nih,’ ka ti pha, ‘A hming ieng am a na?’ tîng an ta, an kuomah ieng am hril ka ti leh?” a tih a."
14,"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.","Pathien chun Mosie kuomah, “UMA kha KA NIH” a tih a. Chun, ama bawkin, “Israel thlahai kuoma chun, UMA khan in kuomah a mi tir a nih, tîng i tih,” a ta."
15,"And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.","Chu naw khawm chu Pathienin Mosie kuomah “Israel thlahai kuoma chun, ‘In thlatuhai Pathien, Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien le Jakob Pathien Jehova chun in kuomah a mi hung tir a nih,’ tîng i tih: hi hi kumkhuoha ka hming a nih, hi hi ṭhang po po mi hriet dân ding chu a nih."
16,"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:","Fe la, Israel upahai chu ko khâwm la, an kuomah, ‘In thlatuhai Pathien, Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien le Jakob Pathien Jehova chu ka kuomah a hung inlâr a, Ka hung sir ta ngei cheu a, Aiguptaa in chunga thil thawha um tahai chu ka hmu tah."
17,"and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.","Chun, in kuomah Aiguptaa rimsiknaa inthawkin Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Amor mihai, Periz mihai, Hiv mihai le Jebus mihai ram khuoizu le nênetuia luong rama chun ṭhuoi lût ka ti cheu ti ka tiem ta cheu kha,’ a tih, ti rawh."
18,"And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.","Chun i râwl chu ngai an ta, nang le Israel upahai chu Aigupta lal kuomah fêng in ta, a kuomah, Hebrai mihai Pathien, LALPA chun keini a mîn tuokpui a, LALPA kan Pathien kuoma inthawina kan inhlân theina dingin, thlalêrah ni thum lam chen mîn fetir rawh, kan hni che hi, tîng in tih."
19,"And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.","Nisienlakhawm, kut thilthaw- theia thawlui naw chun Aigupta lal chun infetir naw tawp a ti cheu ti ka hriet."
20,"And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.","Chun, keiin ka kut inlet ka ta, ka thilmakhai po po chu anni lai ngeia thawin, Aigupta chu hung suksieng ka tih: chu hnunga ruok chun infetir a ti cheu."
21,"And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.","Chun, hi Israel mihai hi Aigupta mihai mithmuah ditsakna inhmutir ka ta; chuongchun, in fe pha chun, ruok ngawtin fe naw tawp in tih:"
22,"But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.","Nuhmei tinin a tuolbâwm le an ina mikhuol kuoma chun, tangka le rângkachak incheinahai le puonsil haw seng a ta, chun in naupasalhai le in naunuhmeihai incheitir nân hmang in ta, chuong ang chun Aigupta mihai chu suksieng in tih,” a tih a."
