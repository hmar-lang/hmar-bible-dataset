1,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.","Israel thla mipui po po chu LALPA thupêk angin, an inzin dânbi ang peiin, Sin thlalêra inthawk chu an suok tah a, Rephidimah puon in an zar a; nisienlakhawm, chu hmuna chun mipui ta dingin tui dâwn ding a um nawh a."
2,"Wherefore the people strove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why strive ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt Jehovah?","Chuleiin, mipui chun Mosie an insêlpui a, “Tui dâwn ding mi pe rawh,” an tih a. Mosie chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga kei in min sêlpui am a na? Iengdinga LALPA chu in fie am a na?” a tih a."
3,"And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?","Mipui hlak chu tui duin an dang a châr hleh a, Mosie chunga chun an chier a, “Aiguptaa inthawk keini le kan nauhai le kan ran ruol leh dang- châra mi sukhlum dingin iengdinga i mi ṭhuoi suok am a na?” an tih a."
4,"And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they are almost ready to stone me.","Mosie chun LALPA a ko a, “Hi mipui hi iengtin am thâwng ka ta? Lunga mi dêng dingin an intûng el a ni sih a,” tiin."
5,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Mipui hmaa chun fe la, Israel upahai i kuomah ṭhuoi la, chun, vadung i vuokna hmawl kha i kutin chawi bawk la, fe rawh."
6,"Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.","Ngai ta, Horeba lungpui chunga sawn i hmaah ngîr ka ta; chun, lung- pui chu vuong i ta, a sûnga inthawkin tui hung suok a tih, mipuiin an dâwn theina dingin,” a tih a. Mosie chun Israel upahai mithmu ngeiah chuong ang tak chun a thaw tah a."
7,"And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?","Chun, Israel thlahai helna leiin le “LALPA hi eini lai a um am a ni, a um naw?” tiha, LALPA an infiena lei chun, chu hmun hminga chun Massa le Meriba ân bûk tah a."
8,"Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.","Chun, Amalekhai chu an hung a, Rephidimah Israelhai chu an hung do tah a."
9,"And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.","Mosie chun Joshua kuomah, “Eini lai pasalhai thlang suok la, fe unla, Amalekhai chu va do ro; zîng- ah Pathien hmawl chu ka kuta chawiin tlâng sîpah ngîr ka tih,” a tih a."
10,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.","Joshua chun a kuoma Mosiein a hril ang tak chun a thawh a, Amalekhai chu an do tah a; Mosie, Aron le Hur chu tlâng sîpa chun an hang fe tah a."
11,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.","Mosiein a hmawl ân let sûng po chu Israelhai chun an hneh a, chun, a kut a lâkthlâk phingleh Amalekhai chun an hne ve thung pei a."
12,"But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.","Mosie kuthai chu a hung kham chun, lung an lâk a, a hnuoia chun an sieh a, chu chunga chun a ṭhung tah a. Aron le Hur chun sîr khatah pakhat, sîr dangah pakhatin a kuthai chu an dawm tung zing a; chuong- chun, nisa tlâk hmakhat chu a kuthai chu a phar thei ta zing a."
13,And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.,"Chun, Joshua chun Amalek le a mihai chu kâwlhnâm ngeiin a sunthlûk dêr tâwl tah a."
14,"and Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.","Chun, LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Lekhabuah hi hi hriet zing- na dingin ziek la, vân hnuoi po poa inthawkin Amalek hriet zingna hi thaihmang dêr ka tih ti Joshua naa chun inhriettir rawh,” a tih a."
15,"And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi;","Chun, Mosie chun mâichâm a siem a, a hminga chun “Jehova- Nissi” ân bûk a;"
16,"and he said, Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.","“LALPA chu ka puonzâr a nih” tiin. “LALPA chu ân khâm tah a, LALPA chun a thlahai thla nâwk- sâwng chen khawmin Amalek chunga hin dona nei hlak a tih,” tiin"
