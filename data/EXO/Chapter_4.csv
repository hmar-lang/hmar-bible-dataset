1,"And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee.","Mosie chun a dawn a, “Nisien- lakhawm, ngai ta, kei chu mi ring naw ni hai, ka râwl khawm ngai naw bawk an tih, ‘I kuomah LALPA ân lâr naw kha,’ an mi ti âwm sih a,” a tih a."
2,"And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.","LALPA chun a kuomah, “Kha i kuta kha ieng am a na?” a tih a. Ama chun “Hmawl,” a tih a."
3,"And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.","LALPA chun, “Hnuoi chungah pei thla rawh,” a tih a. Mosie chun hnuoia chun a pei thlâk a, rûlah a hung inchang tah a, Mosie chu a hmaa chun a tlânse tah a."
4,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand);","Chun, LALPA chun Mosie kuom- ah, “I kut khan ban la, a meiah man rawh,” (chun, a kutin a ban a, a chel tah a, a kuta chun hmawl a ni nâwk tah a,)"
5,"that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.","“LALPA, an thlatuhai Pathien, Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien le Jakob Pathien i kuomah a hung inlâr ti an hriet theina dingin,” a tih a."
6,"And Jehovah said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.","LALPA chun a kuomah, “I ângsûnga khan i kut sie rawh,” a ti nâwk a. Chun, a ângsûnga chun a kut chu a sie a; chun a lâk suok nâwk chun, ngai ta, a kut chu vûr anga vârin a lo inphâr tah a."
7,"And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.)","LALPA chun, “I kut kha i âng- sûngah sie nâwk rawh,” a tih a; chun, a kut chu a ângsûngah a sie nâwk a, ngai ta, a ângsûnga inthawka a lâk suok phing chun a taksa dang ang bawkin a um nâwk tah a."
8,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.","LALPA chun, “Nang ring naw chein, inchikna pakhatna rawl khawm ngai naw hai sien khawm, inchikna nuhnung lem bêk chu ngai ngei an tih."
9,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.","Chun hi inchiknahai pahni khawm hi an la ring nawh a, i rawl khawm an la ngai naw rawp chun, vadung tui lâng i ta, hnuoi hul chungah buok i tih; chun, vadunga inthawka tui i lâk chu hnuoi hul chunga chun thisen hung nîng a tih,” a tih a."
10,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.","Mosie chun LALPA kuomah, “Tuhin le a hma khawmin, i siehlaw kuomah thu i hung hril chena khawm, mi danginnâl ka ni nawh a, ṭawng muongtak le leili zawi ka ni sih a,” a tih a."
11,"And Jehovah said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh a man dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? is it not I, Jehovah?","LALPA chun a kuomah, “Mihriem bau chu tuin am a siem a? Tuin am mi chu ṭawngtheilo, nasêt, mitvar le mitdelin a siem? Kei, LALPA hin ni lo am a nih?"
12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak.","Chuongchun, tuhin fe la, kei i bauah um ka ta, i thuhril ding chu inchûktir ka ti che,” a tih a."
13,"And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.","Ama ruok chun, “Aw LALPA, ka hni che, mi dang tir lem el rawh,” a tih a."
14,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.","Mosie chunga chun LALPA lunginsenna chu a hung zuol tah a, “Levi mi, i unaupa Aron kha a um naw am a nih? Thu hriltheitak a nih ti ka hriet. Ngai rawh, nangma tuok dingin a hung suok mêk a; a hmu pha che chun a lungrilah lâwm a tih."
15,"And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.","Ama kuoma chun thu hril i ta, thuhai chu ama bauah sieng i ta: i bau le ama baua chun um ka ta, ieng am in thaw ding chu inchûktir ka ti cheu."
16,"And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God.","Ama chu i ta dingin mipuihai kuoma thuhriltu nîng a tih; ama chu i ta dingin bau nîng a ta, nang chu a ta dingin Pathien ang nîng i tih."
17,"And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.","Hi hmawl hi i kutin chawi pei i ta, chu chun inchiknahai chu thâwng i tih,” a tih a."
18,"And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.","Mosie chu a tarpupa Jethro kuomah a kîr nâwk tah a, a kuomah, “Ka hni che hi, mîn fetir la, ka unauhai Aiguptaa umhai kuoma chun mîn kîrtir nâwk la, damin am an um va hmûng ka tih,” a tih a. Jethro chun Mosie kuomah, “Thla- muongtakin fe rawh,” a tih a."
19,"And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life.","LALPA chun Midian rama Mosie kuomah, “Fe la, Aiguptaah kîr nâwk rawh; nangma sukhlum tum- tuhai po kha an thi ta sih a,” a tih a."
20,"And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.","Mosie chun a naupasalhai le a nuhmei a ṭhuoi a, sabengtung chung- ah anni ân chuongtir a, Aigupta ramah a kîr nâwk tah a. Mosie chun Pathien hmawl chu a kutin a chawi pei a."
21,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Aiguptaa i kîr nâwk pha, i kuta thilmak ka sie po pohai kha Pharao hmaah thaw ngei i ta; nisien- lakhawm, mihai chu ân fetir nawna dingin a lungril chu ka sukngar ding a nih."
22,"And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, Israel is my son, my first-born:","Chun, nangin Pharao kuoma chun, ‘Hieng hin LALPA chun a tih; Israel hi ka naupa, ka nau lutîr a nih;"
23,"and I have said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou hast refused to let him go: behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born.","chuleiin, i kuomah, “Ka naupa hi ka rawng a bâwl theina dingin infetir rawh,” ka ti a nih; infetir chu i phal naw chun, ngai rawh, i naupa i nau lutîr ngei chu sukhlum ka tih, ti ka hril che hi a tih,’ tiin i hril ding a nih,” a tih a."
24,"And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him.","Lam kâra an riekna hmuna chun LALPA chun ân tuokpui a, ama chu that a tum tah a."
25,"Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me.","Zippora chun meitâwklung ngei a lâk a, a naupa serhmawr vun chu a ât thlâk a, Mosie ke chu ân tâwktir a; chun, chu nu chun, “Ka ta dingin moneitu, thisen insuohmang, i ni ngei el hi,” a tih a."
26,"So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood art thou, because of the circumcision.","Chuongchun, LALPAIN Mosie chu ân thla tah a. Chutikle chun a nih chu nu chun “Sertanna lei hin thisen insuohmang moneitu i nih,” a ti chu."
27,"And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.","LALPA chun Aron kuomah, “Thlalêrah Mosie tuok dingin fe rawh,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a feh a, Pathien tlânga chun a vân tuokpui a, ama chu a fâwp tah a."
28,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah wherewith he had sent him, and all the signs wherewith he had charged him.","Mosie chun LALPAIN ama a tirna thuhai po po, le inchikna ama ân kawltirhai po po chu, Aron kuom- ah a hril tah a."
29,And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:,"Chun, Mosie le Aron chu an fe tah a, Israel thla upahai po po chu an ko khâwm a."
30,"and Aaron spake all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.","Aron chun LALPAIN Mosie kuoma thu a hril po pohai chu a hril a, mipuihai hmaa chun inchiknahai chu a thaw tah a."
31,"And the people believed: and when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.","Mipui chun an ring tah a: LALPA chun Israel thlahai chu a hung sir tah a, an rimsik tuorna chu a hmu tah ti an hriet chun, an luhai an kûn a, chibai an bûk tah a."
