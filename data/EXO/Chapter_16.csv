1,"And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.","Elima inthawk chun an inzin suok a, Israel thla mipui po po chu, Aigupta ram an suoksanna thla hnina ni sâwmpanga ni tak chun, Sinai le Elim inkâra Sin thlalêr chu an hung tlung a."
2,And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness:,Israel thla mipui po po chu thlalêra chun Mosie le Aron chunga chun an chier tah a.
3,"and the children of Israel said unto them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.","Israel thlahai chun an kuomah, “Aigupta rama sa bêlhai leh kan ṭhung a, bei kan dittâwka fa zing khan LALPA kuta chun thi el inlang ni ding bah: hieng mipui po po hi phîngṭâma thi ding elin thlalêrah in mi ṭhuoi lût a ni ta hi,” an tih a."
4,"Then said Jehovah unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.","Chun, LALPA chun Mosie kuom- ah, “Ngai rawh, vâna inthawkin in ta dingin bei ka hung insûrtir ding a nih: mipui va fe suok an ta, ka dân an zâwm le an zâwm naw anni ka fie theina dingin ni tin ni khat tlatâwk la khâwm raw hai se."
5,"And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.","Ni ruk nia chun ni tina an lâk khâwm zât lethni la khâwm an ta, chu chu buotsai an tih,” a tih a."
6,"And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;","Mosie le Aron chun Israel thlahai po po kuoma chun, “Zântieng pha, LALPA chu a nih Aigupta rama inthawka ṭhuoi suoktu cheu chu ti hrieng in ta,"
7,"and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah; for that he heareth your murmurings against Jehovah: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?",zîngtieng leh LALPA ropuina chu hmûng in tih; LALPA chun a chunga in chiernahai chu a hriet sih a. Keini chu ieng am kan niha in mi chier khum hi?” an tih a.
8,"And Moses said, This shall be, when Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that Jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.","Mosie bawk chun, “Zântieng chun sa le zîngtieng chun bei dittâwk fâk ding a pêk pha cheu chun LALPA a nih ti hrieng in tih, a chunga in chiernahai chu LALPA chun a hriet sih a: keini chu ieng am kan nih a? In chierna chu keini chungah ni loin LALPA chungah a ni lem in sawnnaw,” a tih a."
9,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah; for he hath heard your murmurings.","Chun, Mosiein Aron kuomah, “Israel thla mipui po po kuoma chun, ‘LALPA hmaa chun hung hnai ro, in chiernahai po po chu a hriet sih a,’ ti rawh,” a tih a."
10,"And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.","Chun, Israel thla mipui po po kuoma Aronin a hril phingleh, thlalêr tieng chu an en a, sûm laia Pathien ropuina hung inlang chu an hmuh a."
11,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah a hril a,"
12,"I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.","“Israel thlahai chiernahai chu ka hriet a, an kuomah, ‘Zântieng chun sa fâng in ta, zîngtieng chun beia sukkhawp nîng in tih, chun LALPA in Pathien chu ka nih ti hrieng in tih’ ti rawh,” tiin."
13,"And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.","Zântieng chun hieng hi a nih a, vamîmhai an hung suok a, riebûk chu a tuomin an hung tuom tah a: zîngkâr ruok chun riebûk vêla chun daidaw a kûr ṭuk el a."
14,"And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground.","Daidaw chuonga kûr ṭuk chu a hul hnung chun, ngai ta, thil inhlûm chite te, hnuoi chunga vûr tlang te vâr sar ang hi thlalêr chung po poa chun a um tah a."
15,"And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? for they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat.","Israel thlahaiin chu chu an hmu chun ieng am a nih an hriet si nawh a, “Ieng am a na?” an inti tâwl a. Mosie chun an kuomah, “LALPAIN fâk dinga bei a pêk cheu chu a ni hi."
16,"This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent.","Hi hi LALPAIN, ‘Mi tin fâk tâwk ang peiin rût ro; mi lu kipin omer khat pei, mi tinin a puon ina mihai ta dingin, in mihai zât ang peiin rût in tih,’ tiha thu a pêk kha a ni hi,” a tih a."
17,"And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.","Israel thlahai chun chuong ang tak chun an thawh a, ṭhenkhatin tam deu, ṭhenkhatin tlâwm deu an rût tah a."
18,"And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.","Chun, omer khat peia an inkhi chun a rût tamtu khawm chun a chuong iengkhawm a nei nawh a, a rût tlâwmtu khawm chu a tlasam chuong naw bawk a; mi tin fâk tâwk ang peiin an rût tah a."
19,"And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.","Chun, Mosiein an kuomah, “Zîngkâr chen tukhawmin hla naw raw se,” a tih a."
20,"Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was wroth with them.","Nisienlakhawm, Mosie thu chu an ngai nawh a, ṭhenkhatin zîngkâr chenin an hlah a, a lo inngeh a, a thu tah a; Mosie chu an chungah a lunginsen ta hleh a."
21,"And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.","Tûk tin elin an rût a, mi tin chun a fâk tâwk ang peiin. Sûna nisa a hung lum pha ruok chun ân tui hmang hlak a."
22,"And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.","Ni ruk ni ruok chun fâk tâwk lêt hni, mi tin ta dinga omer hni peiin an rût a; chun, mipui hotuhai chu an hung a, Mosie kuomah an hril a."
23,"And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, To-morrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hi hi a nih LALPAIN a hril kha: Zînga chu LALPA ta dinga Châwl ni inthieng, châwl ṭawk ṭawk ding ni chu a nih; in suong ding chu suong unla, in zêu ding chu zêu unla, chun, a mahla po po chu zîngkâr chen in ta dinga sie dingin hla el ro,” a tih a."
24,"And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein.","Mosiein a ti ang chun zîngkâr chena dingin an sie tah a; chuong- chun, a lo thu nawh a, a nge hrim khawm a um bawk nawh."
25,"And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.","Mosie chun, “Kha kha vawisûn fa ro, vawisûn hi chu LALPA kuoma Châwl ni inthieng a ni sih a: vawisûn chu in rûtna hlak hmuna hrim hrim hmu naw ti niu."
26,"Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.","Ni ruk sûng chu la khâwm in ta, ni sari ni ruok chu Châwl ni a nih a, chu ni chun pakhat khawm um naw nih,” a tih a."
27,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none.",Ni sari ni chun mipui laia ṭhenkhat chu va rût dingin an fe suoka chu pakhat khawm an hmu nawh.
28,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Ka thupêkhai le ka dânhai chu zâwm nuom loin ieng chen am in um ding a na?"
29,"See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.","Ngai ta u, LALPA chun Châwl ni a pêk cheu leiin ni ruk ni chun ni hni tla bei a pêk si cheu a, mi tin chu in hmun sengah um ṭawk ṭawk ro, ni sari ni chun a hmuna inthawk tukhawm fe suok naw raw se,” a tih a."
30,So the people rested on the seventh day.,"Chuongchun, mipui chu ni sari ni chun an châwl tah a."
31,"And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.","Chun, Israel sûnghai chun, chu hminga chun Manna an inbûk a; koriendar chi anga vâr, ân hnikzie chu bei inphân khuoizu le siem ang hi a nih."
32,"And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.","Mosie chun, hi thil hi a nih LALPAIN, “In thlahai ta dingin omer sip khat kawl zing ro, Aigupta rama inthawka ka ṭhuoi suok lai cheua ka châwmna cheu bei chu an hmu theina dingin, tiha thu a lo pêk chu,” a tih a."
33,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.","Mosie chun Aron kuomah, “Bêl la la, omer sip khat manna chutaka chun sie rawh, chun, i thlahai ta dinga kawl dingin LALPA hmaa chun sie ṭha rawh,” a tih a."
34,"As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.","LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang tak chun Aron chun kawl zing dingin, thuthlungna bâwm hmaa chun a sie tah a."
35,"And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.",Israel thlahai chun mi umna ram an hung tlung hma po kum sawmli sûng chu manna chu an fâk tah a. Kanaan ram ramrihai an hung tlung chen chun an fâk a.
36,Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.,(Omer khat chu Epha hmun sâwma ṭheha hmun khat a nih.)
