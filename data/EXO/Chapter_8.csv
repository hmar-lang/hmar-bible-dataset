1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuomah, “Pharao kuomah va fe la, a kuomah, ‘Hieng hin LALPÂN a tih; Ka rawng an bâwl theina dingin ka mihai infetir rawh."
2,"And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:","Anni infetir i phal naw chun, ngai rawh, i ram sûng po po uṭawk haiin ka hung hrem ding a nih."
3,"and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs:","Vadung chu uṭawkhaiin sip an ta, chuong chu hung suok an ta, i in sûnga dâm, i khum pindan sûnga dâm, i khum chunga dâm, i siehlaw- hai in sûnga dâm, i mihai chunga dâm, i thuk sûnga dâm, i bei siemna thuk sûnga dâm hung lût an tih."
4,"and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.","Chuong uṭawkhai chu nanga chunga le i mihai chunga le, i siehlawhai chungah hung ṭuong seng an tih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a tih a."
5,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuomah, “Aron kuoma chun, ‘Vadunghai, tuiluongnahai le dîlhai chungah i kuta i hmawl chu inlet la,Aigupta ram chungah uṭawkhai hung suok raw hai se,’ ti rawh,” a ta."
6,"And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.","Chun, Aron chun Aiguptaa tuihai chunga chun a bân a phar a, uṭawk- hai chu an hung suok a, Aigupta ram chu an dâp ta vawng a."
7,"And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.","Chun, aisânthiemhai khawm chun an dawi hmangin chuong ang tak chun an thawh a, Aigupta ram chunga chun uṭawkhai chu an hung suok veh a."
8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah.","Pharao chun Mosie le Aron a ko a, “LALPA chu ngên ro, ka mihai le ka kuoma inthawkin uṭawkhai hi la hmang sienla; chun, LALPA kuoma an inthâwi theina dingin mipui chu infetir ka tih,” a tih a."
9,"And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?","Mosie chun Pharao kuomah, “Nangma le i ina uṭawkhai chu sukbohmanga vadunga bak chun um zing dingin i mihai le i siehlawhai le nanga ta dingin iengtik am ka ngên pêk ding cheu lunginsiettakin mi hril rawh,” a tih a."
10,"And he said, Against to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Jehovah our God.","Ama chun, “Zînga leh,” a tih a. Ama chun, “I thu ang peiin ni raw se: LALPA kan Pathien ang hi mi tu- khawm an um nawh ti i hriet theina dingin."
11,"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.","Uṭawkhai chu i mihai le i sie- hlawhai le i in le nangmaa inthawkin fe hmang an ta, vadunga bak um tâng an tih,” a tih a."
12,And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.,"Chun, Mosie le Aron chu Pharao kuoma inthawk chu an fe suok tah a: chun, Mosie chun Pharao chunga uṭawkhai a hung suksuok thua chun LALPA chu a ko tah a."
13,"And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.","LALPA chun Mosie thu ang ngei chun a hung thawh a; lohai, khuohai le, inhaia uṭawkhai chu an thi hmang vawng tah a."
14,And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank.,"A bûm bûmin an inkhâwm a, ram chu a thûkin a thu a."
15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken.","Nisienlakhawm, Pharao chun chuong chu a bo tah ti a hriet chun, a lungril a sukngar a; LALPAIN a lo hril ta ang ngei khan an thu chu a ngai nawh a."
16,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.","LALPAIN Mosie kuomah, “Aron kuoma chun, ‘I hmawl kha inlet la, hnuoi chunga pilvut chu vaw rawh, Aigupta ram po poah hrikhai an hung ni theina dingin,’ ti rawh,” a tih a."
17,"And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.","Chuong ang tak chun an thawh a, Aron chun a kuta hmawl chu ân let a, hnuoia pilvut chu a vuok a, sa le mihriem chunga chun hrikhai an hung um tah a; Aigupta ram po poa chun pilvut chu hrikin a hung inchang vawng tah a."
18,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast.","Aisânthiemhai chun an dâwi hmangin hrikhai suksuok dingin an thaw veh a, nisienlakhawm, an thei nawh a. Chuongchun, sa le mihriem chunga chun hrikhai chu an um tah a."
19,"Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.","Aisânthiemhai chun Pharao kuomah, “Hi hi Pathien kutpâr a nih,” an tih a. Pharao lungril ruok chu sukngarin a um a, LALPAIN a lo hril ta ang ngei khan, an thu chu a ngai chuong nawh."
20,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.","Chun, LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Zîngkâr tho la, Pharao chu tui tienga a fe lai chu lo nghâk la, a kuomah, ‘LALPAIN hieng hin a tih, ka rawng an bawl theina dingin ka mihai infetir rawh."
21,"Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.","Chuong ni loa, ka mihai în fetir naw chun nang le i siehlawhai le i mihai chunga le, i in sûnga le, Aigupta mihai inhai le an umna leihnuoi po poa chun tho ruolpui hung tir ka tih."
22,"And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.","Chu ni chun ka mihai umna Gosen ram chu suktum ka ta, tho ruol hrim um der naw ni hai, hnuoi chunga hin kei LALPA ka nih ti i hriet theina dingin."
23,And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by to-morrow shall this sign be.,"Chuong ang chun i mihai le ka mihai inkârah thlierhranna nei ka tih; chu inchikna chu zîngah hung tlung a tih,’ ti rawh,” a tih a."
24,"And Jehovah did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.","Chun, LALPA chun chuong ang chun a hung thaw tah a. Pharao in sûnga le a siehlawhai inhai sûnga chun thohai râpthlâktakin an hung a: chuong thohai lei chun Aigupta ram sung po poah ram chu suksietin a um tah a."
25,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.","Chun, Pharao chun Mosie le Aron chu a ko a, “Fe unla, hi ram sûnga hin in Pathien kuoma chun inthâwi ro,” a tih a."
26,"And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?","Mosie chun, “Chuong anga thaw chu rem thei naw nih. Kan Pathien LALPA kuoma kan inthâwinaa chun Aigupta mihai tirdak zâwng inhlân ding kan ni sih a. Aigupta mihai tirdak zâwng chu an mithmu ngeia kan inhlân chun lungin an mi dêng naw ding am a nih?"
27,"We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.","Thu a mi pêk angin, thlalêrah ni thum lama hlaah fêng kan ta, LALPA kan Pathien kuoma chun inthâwi kan tih,” a tih a."
28,"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.","Pharao chun, “LALPA in Pathien kuoma chun thlalêra in inthâwi theina dingin infetir ka ti cheu, amiruokchu, hlatakah fe naw unla, ka ta ding khawmin mi ngênpêk rawh,” a tih a."
29,"And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.","Mosie chun, “I kuoma inthawk- in fe suok ka ta, Pharao le a sie- hlawhai le a mihaia inthawka, thohai hi zînga inthawka an fe hmangna dingin LALPA chu hnîng ka tih; amiruokchu, mipuihai chu LALPA kuoma inthâwi dinga infetir loin hmusittakin Pharao hin sawisa lep ta naw phawt raw se,” a tih a."
30,"And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.","Mosie chu Pharao kuoma inthawk chun a suok a, LALPA chu a ngên tah a."
31,"And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.","LALPA chun Mosie thu ang pei chun a thawh a; Pharao le a siehlawhai le a mihaia inthawkin thohai chu a lâk hmang vawng a, pakhat khawm a um ta nawh a."
32,"And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.","Hi ṭum khawm hin Pharao chun a lungril a sukngar a, mipui chu ân fetir chuong naw nâwk a."
