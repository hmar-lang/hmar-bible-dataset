1,"In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.","Aigupta rama inthawka Israel thlahai an fe suok chena inthawka thla thumna, chu ni chun Sinai thlalêr chu an hung tlung tah a."
2,"And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.","Rephidim an mâksan a, Sinai thlalêr an hung tlung chun thlalêra chun puon in an zar a; chutaka chun Israelhai chun tlâng hmaa chun bûk an khuor a."
3,"And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:","Mosie chu Pathien kuomah a hang feh a, chun, tlânga inthawkin LALPA chun ama a hung ko a, “Jakob sûnghai lai chun hieng hin hril la, Israel thlahai chu hril rawh;"
4,"Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.","Aigupta mihai chunga ka thil- thaw tah le, mupui thlahai chunga phur cheua ka kuoma ngei ka ṭhuoizie cheu kha in hmu tah a."
5,"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:","Chuleiin, tuhin, ka thu in awi tak tak a, ka thuthlung in kawl tak tak ding chun, hnuoi hi ka ta a ni sih a, hnam dang po po lai chun ka ta dingin ro bîk nîng in tih."
6,"and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.","Chun, ka ta dingin thiempuhai ram le hnam inthieng ni bawk in tih. Hieng thuhai hi a nih Israel thlahai kuoma i hril ding chu,” a tih a."
7,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.","Chun, Mosie chu a hung a, Israel upahai chu ân kotir a, hieng thuhai po po LALPAIN a kuoma thu a pêkhai chu an hmaah a târlang tah a."
8,"And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.","Chun, mipui po po chun a ruolin an dawn a, “LALPAIN a hril po pohai chu thâwng kan tih,” an tih a. Mosie chun mipui thuhai chu LALPA kuoma chun ân tlun tah a."
9,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Ngai ta, i kuoma thu ka hril lai an hriet theina ding le, kumkhuoha an ring zing theina ding chein, sûm sâmup lai i kuomah hung ka tih,” a tih a. Mosie chun mipui thuhai chu LALPA chu a hril a."
10,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Mipui kuoma chun fe la, vawisûn le zîngah sukthieng rawh, an silfênhai chu sâwp hai sienla;"
11,and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.,"ni thum ni chun inzo hieuin um raw hai se, chu ni thum ni chun Sinai tlâng chungah mipui po po mithmuah LALPA chu a hung ṭum ding a ni sih a."
12,"And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:","Chun, a vêlin ramrihai khang- pêk i ta, Tlâng hang kai lo dingin le a sîr vêl tâwk lo dingin invêng ṭha ro; tukhawm tlâng tâwk taphawt chu sukhlum nîng a tih;"
13,"no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.","ama chu kut hrimin tâwk naw nih a, dêng hlum, annawleh, kâp hlum nîng a tih; sa khawm ni sien, mihriem khawm ni sien hring naw hrim hrim a tih: tawtawrâwt sâwttak ân ri pha, tlânga chun hung lâwn an tih,” a tih a."
14,"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.","Mosie chu tlânga inthawk chun mipui kuomah a fe thlah a, mipui chu a sukthieng a, an silfênhai chu an sâwp tah a."
15,"And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.","Chun, mipui kuoma chun, “Ni thum nia chun inzosa hieuin um unla, nuhmei khawm pâwl dêr naw ro,” a tih a."
16,"And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.","Ni thum ni chun zîngkâr a la ni laiin, vâninrûmhai, ṭêktlahai, tlâng chunga sûm sâmup le, tawtawrâwt ri inringtak el chu a um tah a; bûka mipui um po po chu an inthin tah a."
17,And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.,"Mosie chun mipui chu Pathien tuok dingin bûka inthawk chun a hung ṭhuoi suok a, tlâng ṭhuta chun an ngîr tah a."
18,"And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.","LALPA chu meichawka a hung ṭum leiin, Sinai tlâng po po chu a khu ta vawng el a; chu khu chu rawtuina meikhu angin ân tung ta lui el a: tlâng chu nasatakin ân hnîng bawk a."
19,"And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.","Tawtawrâwt ri chu a hung inring deu deu chun Mosie chun a hang biek a, Pathien râwlriin a hung dawn tah a."
20,"And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.","LALPA chu Sinai tlâng chung- ah, tlâng sîpa chun a hung ṭum a: chun, Mosie chu tlânga chun a zuk ko a, Mosie chu a hang fe tah a."
21,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Fe thla la, mipui chu khap rawh, chuong naw chun hung en dingin LALPA kuom hung nêr thleng hlau an ta, mi tamtak bohmang rawi an tih."
22,"And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.","Chun, thiempuhai LALPA hnaia hunghai khawm chu insukthieng raw hai se; chuong naw chun an chungah LALPA lungninaw rawi a tih,” a tih a."
23,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.","Mosie chun LALPA kuomah, “Mipui chu Sinai tlâng hung kai thei naw ni hai, nangin, ‘Tlâng vêla chun ramrihai khang unla, sukthieng ro’, tiha i mi phût tlat leiin,” a tih a."
24,"And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.","LALPA chun a kuomah, “Fe rawh, nang zu fe thla la, Aron ṭhuoiin hung i ta, nisienlakhawm, thiempu- hai le mipui chu LALPA kuoma hung dingin hung innêr thlengtir naw rawh, chuong naw chun an chungah LALPA lungninaw rawi a tih,” a tih a."
25,"So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.","Chuongchun, Mosie chu mipui kuoma chun a fe thlah a, anni a hril tah a."
