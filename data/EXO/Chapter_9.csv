1,"Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.","Chun, LALPA chun Mosie kuom- ah, “Pharao kuomah fe la, ‘LALPA, Hebraihai Pathien chun hieng hin a tih: ka rawng an bâwl theina dingin ka mihai infetir rawh."
2,"For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,","Anni chu infetir i phal nawha, i khuokhir zing chun,"
3,"behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: there shall be a very grievous murrain.","ngai rawh, loa i ran ruol umhai, sakawrhai, sabengtunghai, sa- nghâwngseihai, bâwng ruolhai le, berâm ruolhai chungah LALPA kut chu hri râpthlâktak leh tlâng a tih."
4,And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.,"Chun, LALPA chun, Aigupta mihai le Israelhai ran ruolhai thlier a ta, Israel thlahai ta taphawt chu iengkhawm thi naw tawp an tih, a tih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a tih a."
5,"And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.","LALPA chun hun bîk a ruot a, “Hi thil hi, hi rama hin zîngah LALPAIN thawng a tih,” a tih a."
6,And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.,"A zînga chun chu thil chu LALPA chun a thaw tah a. Aigupta mihai ran ruol po po chu an thi vawng a, Israel thlahai ran ruol ruok chu pakhat khawm an thi nawh a."
7,"And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.","Pharao chun mi a tir a, Israel thlahai ran ruol chu pakhat khawm an thi dêr nawh ti a hriet a. Nisienlakhawm, Pharao lungril chu a ngar a, mihai chu ân fetir chuong nawh."
8,"And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.","LALPA chun Mosie le Aron kuoma chun, “Thuka vut kut sipin chawi unla, Pharao mithmu ngeiah Mosiein vân tieng vawr raw se."
9,"And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.","Chun, Aigupta ram chung po poah pilvut indi takah inchang a ta, Aigupta ram sûng po povah mihriem le ran chungah khuoihli invûngin inchang a tih,” a tih a."
10,"And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.","Chun, thuka vut chu an lâk a, Pharao hmaa chun an ngir a; Mosie chun vân tieng chun a vawr tah a, chuongchun, mihriem le ran chunga chun khuoihli invûngah ân chang tah a."
11,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.","Chun, khuoihlihai lei chun aisânthiemhai chu Mosie hmaa chun an ngîr thei ta nawh a; chu khuoihli chu Aigupta mihai po po le aisân- thiemhai chunga khawm a um seng sih a."
12,"And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.","Chun, LALPAIN Pharao lungril chu a sukngar a, LALPAIN Mosie kuoma a hril ta angin an thu hril chu a ngai chuong nawh a."
13,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Zîngkâr inhmatakin tho la, Pharao hmaah ngîr la, a kuomah, ‘Hebraihai Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ka rawng an bâwl theina dingin ka mihai infetir rawh."
14,"For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.","Hnuoi chung po poah keima ang tukhawm an um nawh ti i hriet theina dingin, tuta ṭum hin chu, i mihai le i siehlawhai le nangma chunga ngei ka hri po po ka hung tir ding a ni sih a."
15,"For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth:","Tuhin ka kut inlet ka ta, i mihai le nang ngei chu hripuiin hrem ka ti cheu a, hnuoia inthawka sâtthlâk ni tâng i tih:"
16,"but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.","nisienlakhawm, hi thilthaw kawng ngeihaia hin ka thilthawthei- nahai chu nangmaa inentir a ni theina ding le khawvêl po poa ka hming chu phuongdar a ni theina dingin ka la dawmngir zing che a ni hi."
17,"As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?","Ka mihai chunga hin nang le nang inchawimawiin, anni chu i lân fetir naw rawp ding a ni maw?"
18,"Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.","Ngai rawh, zîngah tu pha ngei hin riel nasa râpthlâk insûrtir ka ta; chuong ang hrim hrim chu Aigup- taah, hi ram um hlima inthawk tu chen hin a la um ngai dêr nawh."
19,"Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.","Chuleiin, tuhin mi tir la, i ran ruol le loa i thil nei po po chu inhulah hung la lût vak raw hai se; mi tin le ran loa um taphawthai, ina hung lâk lût nawhai chungah riel chu a hung sûr ding a ni sih a, an thi vawng ding a nih, a tih,’ tiin hril rawh,” a tih a."
20,He that feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:,Pharao siehlawhai laia LALPA thu ṭitu chun a siehlawhai le a ran ruol chu inahai ân tlân lûttir a;
21,and he that regarded not the word of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field.,LALPA thu ngaisaknawtu ruok chun a siehlawhai le ran ruol chu loah ân umtir a.
22,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.","Chun, LALPAIN Mosie kuom- ah, “Aigupta ram sûng po poa, mihriem le ran le loa thlai tinrêng chungah, Aigupta ram po poah riel nasatak a hung sûr theina dingin, vân tieng i kut phar rawh,” a tih a."
23,"And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.","Chun, Mosie chun a hmawl chu vân tieng ân let a; chuongchun, LALPA chun vâninrûm le riel chu a hung tir tah a, hnuoia chun mei dâm a zuk tlah a, LALPA chun Aigupta ram chunga chun riel ân sûrtir tah a."
24,"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.","Chuongchun, riel, ṭêktla le riel inpawl, râpthlâktak el, Aigupta ram po poah, hnam a hung ni chena inthawka la hmu ngai dêr lo chu a hung tlung tah a."
25,"And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.","Aigupta ram po poa, loa thil um taphawt chu mihriem le ran khawm a dêng hlum ta vawng a; riel chun loa thlaihna tinrêng chu a dêng hlumin, rama thinghai khawm chu a dêng thliek bawk a."
26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.",Israel thlahai umna Gosen rama bak chun riel chu a tla ve nawh a.
27,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.","Chun, Pharao chun mi a tir a, Aron le Mosie chu ân kotir a, an kuomah, “Tuta ṭum chu ka lo suol takzet a nih, ka mihai le kei chu kan khawhlo a, LALPA ruok chu a fel a nih."
28,"Entreat Jehovah; for there hath been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.","Hun ta raw se, riel le vâninrûm ri nasatakhai hi a bona dingin LALPA chu hni la, chuongchun, infetir ka ti cheu, um ta hrim hrim naw ti niu,” a tih a."
29,"And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah’s.","Mosie chun a kuomah, “Khaw- pui hi ka suoksan phingleh, LALPA tieng ka kut phar ka ta, hnuoi hi LALPA ta a nih ti i hriet theina dingin, vâninrûmhai chu mâng a ta; riel hrim khawm um nâwk ta dêr naw nih."
30,"But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God.","Nisienlakhawm, nang le i sie- hlawhai chun, LALPA Pathien chu la ṭi chuong naw ti niu ti ka hriet a nih,” a tih a."
31,"And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.","Ziza le buṭei chu dêng hlumin an um a, buṭei chu a vui tahin ziza khawm chu a pâr lai tak a ni sih a."
32,But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.,"Bupui le mîm ruok chu dêng siet an ni ve nawh a, an puitling inhnu leiin."
33,"And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.","Mosie chu Pharao kuoma inthawka khawpui puoha a suok chun, LALPA kuom tieng a kut chu a phar tah a; chun, vâninrûmhai le riel chu a ma tah a, hnuoi chunga chun ruo khawm a sûr ta nawh a."
34,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.","Pharao chun ruo le riel le vâninrûmhai chu a ma tah ti a hmu chun, a la suksuol ta rawp a, ama le a siehlawhai khawm chun an lungril chu an la sukngar ta rawp a."
35,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.","Pharao lungril chu sukngarin a um a, Mosie baua LALPAIN a lo hril ta angin, ama chun Israel thlahai chu ân fetir nuom nawh a."
