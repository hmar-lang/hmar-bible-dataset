1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest.","LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “A hmasa angtak khan lung phêk pahni sak la; chun, a phêk hmasa i sukkawihai chunga thuhai kha, chu phêkhai chunga chun ziek ka tih."
2,"And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.","Zîngkâr inzo hieu la, zîngkâr chun Sinai tlângah hung la, tlâng sîpa ka kuoma chun nang ngei hung rawh."
3,And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.,"Tukhawm nang leh an hung ding a ni nawh a, tlâng chung po poa chun tukhawm hmu an ni bawk ding a ni nawh a; chun, tlâng hmaa chun berâm ruolhai amanih, bâwng ruol- hai amani khawm tla bawk naw raw hai se,” a tih a."
4,"And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.","Chuongchun, Mosie chun a hmasahai ang tak chun lung phêk pahni chu a sak tah a; chun, zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, LALPAIN thu a pêk ang chun, lung phêk pahni chu a kutin a chawi a, Sinai tlânga chun a hang fe tah a."
5,"And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.","LALPA chu sûma chun a hung thlah a, ama kâwla chun a hung ngîr a, LALPA hming chu a phuong tah a."
6,"And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth;","LALPA chun a hmatieng a lekhêl a, “LALPA chu, LALPA chu Pathien, lainatnaa sip, mi lunginsietthei, lunginsen intak, zângaina le thutak hau,"
7,"keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.","sâng tamtak chunga hmangai- naa sip, khawhlona le bawsietna le suolna ngaidam hlak, thiemnawa ngaihai ruok chu iengti khawma inthla el ngailo, pahai rîtlona nauhai, nauhai nauhai nâwk le suon thumna le suon lina chen chunga thung hlaktu a nih,” tiin a phuong tah a."
8,"And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.","Mosie chu inhmâwtakin hnuoi tieng a lu a kûn a, chibai a bûk tah a."
9,"And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.","“Tuhin nanga mithmuah lungin- sietna ka hmu ta chun, Aw Lalpa, ka ngên che, Lalpa chu keini lai fe ve raw se; mi kâwmaw ni de hai sien khawm, kan khawhlona le suolna chu mi ngaidam la, i rochan dingin nangin mi la rawh,” a tih a."
10,"And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah; for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee.","LALPA chun, “Ngai ta, thu- thlung ka siem hi. Ieng hnam lai khawm le hnuoi chung po poa la thaw ngai dêr lo, i mihai po po hmaah thilmakhai thâwng ka tih. Anni laia i umna mi po po chun LALPA sinthaw chu hmûng an tih, nangmaha thil ka thaw ding chu râpthlâktak a ni sih a."
11,"Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.","“Vawisûn thu ka pêk che hi zâwm rawh. Ngai rawh, Amor mihai, Kanaan mihai, Hit mihai, Periz mihai, Hiv mihai le Jebus mihai chu i hmaha inthawkin ka hnawt suok ding a nih."
12,"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:","I chungah fimkhur rawh, chuong naw chun i fêna tieng ram hluotuhai leh thuthlung siem rawi i ta, nangni laia châng ni rawi a tih."
13,"but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim;","Amiruokchu, an mâichâmhai chu kei chim in ta, an milimhai chu vaw nawi vawng in ta, an pathiennu Aser- a lim khawm chu phûr thlûng in tih:"
14,"(for thou shalt worship no other god: for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God);","pathien dang hrim i biek ding a ni nawh, LALPA, a hming el khawm ‘Thikthusie’ chu Pathien thikthu- setak a ni sih a."
15,"lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice;","A ram hluotuhai le chun thuthlung siem hlau rawi i tih: an pathienhai hnawta an inzawr a, an pathienhai kuoma inthâwina an nei phain, mi pakhatin fiel a ti cheh a, an inthâwina chu fa rawi i tih."
16,"and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods.","An naunuhmeihai chu i naupa- salhai inneitir i ta, an naunuhmeihai chun an pathienhai hnawta an inzawr phain, i naupasalhai chu an pathienhai leh inuiretir rawi an tih."
17,Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.,“Siemfâwm pathien hrim in siempêk ding a ni nawh.
18,"The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.","“Chawlṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe chu nei zing i tih. Ni sari sûng chu, thu ka pêk ang che khan, Abib thla hun ruota khan fâng i tih; Abib thlaa chun Aiguptaa inthawkin i hung suok a ni sih a."
19,"All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep.","Sul hung kêu po po, bâwng le berâmte hmasa a chal po po chu ka ta an nih."
20,"And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.",Sabengtungte hmasa tak chu berâmtein intlan i tih; în tlan naw chun a rîng her bawng i tih. I naupasal nau lutîr po po chu intlan i tih. Tukhawm ka hmaah kut ruokin a hung inlang ding a ni nawh.
21,"Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.","“Ni ruk sûng sin thâwng i ta, ni sari ni ruok chun châwl i tih; hnuoi inlet huna le busîk huna khawm châwl i tih."
22,"And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.","Chun, hapta kâr ruoiṭhehai, bupui tlung hmasa sîklai le kum tâwpa lâk khâwm zo ruoiṭhehai chu hmang i tih."
23,"Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.","LALPA Pathien, Israel Pathien hmaa chun i mi pasalhai chu kum khatah ṭum thum an inlang ding a nih."
24,"For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year.","Hnamhai chu i hmaah hnawt suok ka ta, i ramrihai chu ka suk- lien ding a ni sih a; kum khat sunga ṭum thum, LALPA i Pathien hmaha inlang dinga i fe laiin, i ram chu tukhawmin inhnarin lâk tum naw ni hai."
25,Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.,“Ka inthâwina thisen chu chawl ṭhang bei leh în hlân ding a ni nawh. Fekân ruoiṭhe inthâwina chu zîngkâr chena dingin hla ding a ni bawk nawh.
26,The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.,"I hnuoi ra thar hmasatak chu LALPA i Pathien inah i hung lâk ding a nih. Kêlte chu a nu nênetuiah i suong ding a ni nawh,” tiin."
27,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.","Chun, LALPA chun Mosie kuomah, “Hieng thuhai hi ziek rawh, hieng thuhai dungzui hin Israel le nanga kuomah thuthlung ka siem sih a,” a tih a."
28,"And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.","Chutaka chun Mosie chu LALPA le chun ni sâwmli le zân sawmli a um a; bei hlak a fâk nawh a, tui khawm a dâwn bawk nawh a. Thuthlung thuhai, thupêk sâwmhai chu lungphêkhai chunga chun a ziek tah a."
29,"And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.","Chun, Mosie chu Thuthlung phêkhai pahni chu a kuta chawiin Sinai tlânga inthawkin a hung thlah a; tlânga inthawka a hung thlâk lai chun, Pathien ân biekpui leiin a hmai vun chu a lo var ti a hriet nawh a."
30,"And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.","Aron le Israel thlahai po poin Mosie chu an en a, a hmai vun a lo var pup el ti an hmu chun a kâwl hnaia fe chu an ṭi tah a."
31,And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them.,"Mosie ruok chun anni chu a ko a, Aron le mipui ṭhuoituhai po po chu a kuomah an hung kîr a, Mosie chun a lo biek tâwl a."
32,And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him in mount Sinai.,"Chun, chu hnunga chun Israel thlahai po po chu an hung hnai a, Sinai tlânga LALPAIN a kuoma a hril po po chu thupêkin anni chu a pêk tah a."
33,"And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.","Mosie chun anni a biek zo chun, hmai inkhumnain a hmai ân khum a."
34,"But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.","Amiruokchu, Mosie chu LALPA kuomah ama be dinga a lût po leh a hmai inkhumna chu, a hung suok nâwk hmakhat a lâkthlâk zing a: chun, a hung suok a, a kuoma thu pêka um chu Israel thlahai kuoma chun a hril a;"
35,"And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.","chun, Israel thlahai chun Mosie hmai, Mosie hmai vun var chu an hmu tah a. LALPA kuoma ama be dinga a fe nâwk hmakhat chun, Mosie chun a hmai inkhumnain ân khum nâwk hlak a."
