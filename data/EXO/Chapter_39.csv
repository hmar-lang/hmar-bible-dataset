1,"And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk angin, sahmul dumpâwl, a êm le seninlârin Hmun Inthienga rawng- bâwlna dingin silfên ṭhatakhai an siem a, Aron silfên inthienghaiah an siem a."

3,"And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman.","Rângkachak chu phêk inphân- takhaiin an sut a, a zaiin an ât a, kutthiemtak sinthaw, sahmul dum- pâwl, a êm, seninlâr le pat zai inhmi kawpa zep dingin."

5,"And the skilfully woven band, that was upon it, wherewith to gird it on, was of the same piece and like the work thereof; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","Zakaw chunga a khitna, kâwng- chûn chu hmangruo thuhmun le khâwng dân thuhmuna thiemtaka khâwng, rângkachak zai, sahmul dumpâwl, a êm, le seninlâr le pat zai inhmi kawpa, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang taka siem a nih."
6,"And they wrought the onyx stones, inclosed in settings of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel.","Onik lunghai chu an ât a, Israel thlahai hming ang peiin, hming- namna ker anga rângkachak ker- kuokhaia chun an phûm a."

8,"And he made the breastplate, the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.","Chun, kutthiemtak siem dânin, zakawsîng siem ang bawk chun, rângkachak zai le sahmul dumpâwl, a êm, seninlâr le pat zai inhmi kawpin âwmbel a siem a,"
9,"It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double.","killi inchen seng a nih a: âwmbel chu thlep thuoa siem a nih a, thlep thuo chun a seizie khâp khat, a lienzie khâp khat bawk a nih."
10,"And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row;","Chutaka chun lunghai chu tlar liin an inbûk a, sardion, topaz le karbankle lung chu tlar khatna a nih."
11,"and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;","A tlar hnina chu emeral, sapphir le diamond lung;"
12,"and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;","a tlar thumna chu jasinth, agate le amethust lung,"
13,"and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in inclosings of gold in their settings.","a tlar lina chu birul, onik le jasper lunghai a nih a; rângkachak kerkuokhaia phûm an nih."
14,"And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes.","Lunghai chu sâwm le pahnih, Israel naupasalhai hming ang peia an hming leh, hnam sâwmpahnia dingin lung tin chu a hming pei leh, hmingnamna anga siem a nih."
15,"And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.","Âwmbel chunga chun rângka- chak kerkuok pahni le rângkachak inthieng khaidiet, hruol anga inher- thlawp an siem a."
16,"And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.","Rângkachak kerkuok pahni le rângkachak kuol pahni bawk an siem a, a kuol pahni chu âwmbel tâwp ve vea chun an inbûk a."
17,And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.,Rângkachak khaidiethai pahni chu âwmbel hmawra kuol pahnia chun an inbûk a.
18,"And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof.","Khaidiet hmawr khingtieng pahni chu kerkuok pahnia chun an inbûk a, zakawsîng liengko bel hma- tieng panga chun an khai a."
19,"And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.","Rângkachak kuol pahni an siem a, âwmbel hmawr khing tieng sîr tâwp, sûngtieng pang zakawsîng deptienga chun an inbûk a."
20,"And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.","Rângkachak kuol pahni an siem a, hmatiengah zakawsîng liengko bel hnuoitieng pang zakawsîng khitna thiemtaka khâwng chunga ân tuok- naa khan an inbûk a."
21,"And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang taka, âwmbel chu zakawsîngah det- taka a kawp theina ding le, zakaw- sîng khitna thiemtaka khâwng chung- a chun a um theina dingin, âwmbela kuolhai chu zakawsînga kuolhaia chun hrui dumpâwlin an khit mat a."
22,"And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;","Chun, thiempu zakawfuol a khâwnga khâwngin a dumpâwl vawngin a siem a;"
23,"and the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent.","Zakawfuola a âwng chu indona phaw zakuo anga, ân ek nawna dinga a vêl tuoka tuom a nih."
24,"And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.","Zakawfuol hmawr tlânga chun dumpâwl, a êm, seninlâr le patzai inhmi kawpin theibufai an siem a."
25,"And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;","Rângkachak inthiengin telnêng- hai an siem bawk a, telnênghai chu theibufai inkâr, zakawfuol hmawr tlânga a vêl suoka theibufai inkâra chun an khai a:"
26,"a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk angin, rawngbâwlna ding zakawfuol hmawr tlâng vêl suoka chun, telnêng theibu- fai, telnêng le theibufai ti peia khaiin."
27,"And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,","Aron le a naupasalhai ta dingin puon zai inhmi a khâwnga khâwngin zakawchunghai an siem a,"
28,"and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,","puon zai inhmi lukâwm, puon zai inhmi lukhum, puon zai inhmi kawpin puon zai inhmi kekawr hnuoihai,"
29,"and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses.","puon zai inhmi kawp ṭhatak le sahmul dumpâwl, a êm le senin- lâr ṭhuimawia chei kâwngchûn, LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk ang chun an siem bawk a."
30,"And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH.","Rângkachak inthiengin lukhim inthieng phêk an siem a, chutaka chun “LALPA TA DINGA INTHIENG” ti an ziek a."
31,"And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.",LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk anga a chunga lukâwma khitdena dingin hrui dumpâwl an inbûk a.
32,Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses; so did they.,"Chuong ang chun intuokna puon in sin po po chu zo a ni tah a, chun Israel thlahai chun LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk po po angtak chun an thawh a, chuong ang tak chun an thaw tah a."
33,"And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets;","Biekbûk chu Mosie kuomah an hung lâk a, a puon in le a hmangruo po po, a kuoikimhai, a thingphêkhai, a bangruhai, a banhai le ân ṭhut- nahai;"
34,"and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen;","ân khumna berâmchal le kêl vun suksenhai, a chung inkhumna seal vunhai, a puonzâr khaihai:"
35,"the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat;","Thuthlung bâwm le a zâwn- funghai, zângaina ṭhungpha leh;"
36,"the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread;","dawkân le a bûrlebêlhai po po le inentirna bei,"
37,"the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light;","Rângkachak inthienga siem sathâukhâwnvar siena le khâwn- varhai, a khâwnvarhai siena pei leh a hmangruo po po, meivar dinga hriek;"
38,"and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent;","rângkachak mâichâm, innâlna hriek, riminhnik rawmi le puon in kawtkhâr puonzâr ding;"
39,"the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;","dâr mâichâm le dâr inphan thuk, zâwnfunghai le a bûrlebêl po pohai, dâr maihûn le ân ṭhutna;"
40,"the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;","tuolzâwl inhuonna puonzâr khaihai, a banhai, a kerkuokhai, tuolzâwl inhuonna kawtkhâra puon- zâr, a hruihai, a kilnahai, biekbûk le intuokna puon ina dinga rawng- bâwlna hmangruo po po;"
41,"the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office.","Hmun Inthienga rawngbâwlna dinga silfên khâwng ṭhatakhai, thiempu Aron silfênhai le, thiempu sina rawngbâwlna dinga a naupasal- hai silfênhai le chun an hung lâk a."
42,"According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.",LALPAIN Mosie thu a pêk po po ang tak chun Israel thlahai chun sin po po chu an thaw tah a.
43,"And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as Jehovah had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.","Mosie chun an sinthawhai po po chu a en a, LALPAIN thu a pêk ang tak chun an thaw zo tah ti a hmuh a; chuong ang tak chun an thaw zo tah a; chun, Mosiein anni chu mal a sâwm tah a."
