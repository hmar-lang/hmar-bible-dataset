3,"And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.","LALPA chun Aiguptahai mit- hmuah Israel mihai chu ditsakna ân hmutir a, Mosie ngei khawm chu mipui mithmu le Pharao siehlawhai mithmuah Aigupta ram sûnga chun mi lientak a ni bawk a."

5,"and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle.","Aigupta rama nau lutîr po po, Pharao nau lutîr a lalṭhungphaa ṭhunga inthawka, bu râwtnawinaa sinthaw suoknu nau lutîr tak chen le, ran ruol tê hmasatakhai le chun thi fai vawng an tih."
6,"And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more.","Chun, Aigupta ram sûng po poa chun ṭap nasatak um a tih: chuong ang hrim hrim chu a la um ngai dêr nawh a, um khawm um nâwk ta dêr bawk naw ni."
7,"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that Jehovah doth make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, Israel mihai le Aigupta mihai kâra chun LALPAIN ieng ang lâwma danglamna am a sie ti in hriet theina dingin, Israel thlahai laia chu ran le mihriem khawm ui khawmin inngak naw ni."
8,"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.","Chun, hieng i siehlawhai po po hi ka kuomah hung an ta, ka hmaa bawkkhupin, Nanga zuitu dinghai po po le chun suok ta rawh,’ mi tîng an tih; chun, chu hnunga chun suok tâng ka tih, tiin,” a tih a.

9,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.","Chun LALPAIN Mosie kuomah, “Aigupta rama hin ka thilmakhai sukpung a ni theina dingin, Pharao chun in thu a ngai naw ding a ni hi,” a tih a."
10,"And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.","Mosie le Aron chun Pharao hmaa chun thilmakhai po po chu an thaw tah a; nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun Pharao lungril chu a sukngar a, Israel thlahai chu a rama inthawk ân fe suoktir chuong nawh a."
