1,"Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.","Hezekia chu kum sâwmhni pangaa upa a niin ro a rêl ṭan a; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmhni pakuo sûng ro a rêl a; a nu hming chu Abija, Zekaria naunu a nih."
2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.","A thlatu Davidin a thaw ta ang po po khan, ama khawmin LALPA mit- hmua thil indik chu a thawh a."
3,"He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.","A rorêl a kum khatna, a thla khatnaa chun LALPA in chu kawt- khârhai a hawng a, a siem ṭha tah a."
4,"And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,","Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu a hung lâklût a, saktieng panga hmun âwla chun anni chu a ko khâwm a,"
5,"and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.","an kuomah a hril a, “Mi lo ngai ta u, nangni Levi mihai; tuhin nangni le nangni insukthieng unla, in thlatu- hai Pathien LALPA in chu sukthieng unla, hmun inthienga inthawka tirdakumna chu la suok ro."
6,"For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs.","Ei thlatuhai khan an lo bawsiet a, LALPA ei Pathien mithmuah thil suol chu an lo thaw ta sih a; an ngha hmang a; LALPA umna hmuna in- thawk chun an ngha hmang a, an hnung an innghat tah a."
7,"Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.","Chun, tuolpûk kawtkhârhai chu an khâr a, khâwnvarhai chu an her- hlum tah a, riminhnik khawm an raw ta nawh a, Israel Pathien kuoma chun hmun inthiengah pumraw- hmang thilinhlânhai khawm chu an inhlân ta bawk nawh a."
8,"Wherefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.","Chuleiin, LALPA lunginsenna chu Jerusalem le Judahai chunga chun a um a, in mita in hmu ang hin, inhîpna ding le, makti ding le, inzak dingin a siem tah a."
9,"For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.","Ngai ta u, ei thlatuhai chu kâwl- hnâma suktlâwm an ni tah a, ei naupasalhai, ei naunuhmeihai le ei nuhmeihai chu hi lei hin salah an um tah a."
10,"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.","Tuhin, einia inthawka a lungin- senna ṭiumtak chu lâk hmang a ni theina dingin Israel Pathien LALPA le chun thuthlung siem ka lungril a nih."
11,"My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.","Ka naupasalhai, tuhin ngaitha naw ro; riminhnikhai rawh a, a rawngbâwltuhai nia, ama rawngbâwl ding le, a hmaa ngîr dingin LALPA chun a thlang ta si cheu a,” tiin."
12,"Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;","Chun, Levi mihai chu an tho tah a; Kohath naupasalhai chu: Amasai naupa Mahath le Azaria naupa Joel; Merari naupasalhai chu: Abdi naupa Kis le Jehalelel naupa Azaria; Gerson mi chu: Zimma naupa Joa le Joa naupa Eden;"
13,"and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;",Elizaphan naupasalhai chu: Simri le Jeuel; Asaph naupasalhai chu: Zekaria le Mattania;
14,"and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.",Heman naupasalhai chu Jehuel le Simei; Jeduthun naupasalhai chu; Semaia le Uzziel hai chu.
15,"And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.","Chun, an unauhai chu an ko khâwm a, anni chu an insukthieng a, LALPA in chu sukfai dingin LALPA thuin lal thupêk ang tak chun an lût tah a."
16,"And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of Jehovah, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.","Chun, thiempuhai chu LALPA in sûngril lema chun sukfai ding chun an va lût a, LALPA biek in sûnga thil inthiengnaw an hmu po pohai chu LALPA in inhuonna tuol laia chun an hung lâk suok vawng a. Chun, Levi mihai chun Kidron vadung chena lâk hmang dingin an lâk tah a."
17,"Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.","Chuong chun, thla khatna ni khatnaa chun inhlân thieng chu an ṭan a, chu thla ni riet ni chun LALPA tuolpûka chun an hung tlung a; chuongchun, LALPA in po po chu ni riet sûng chun an inhlân thieng a; thla hmasatak ni sâwmparuk ni chun an zo tah a."
18,"Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.","Chun, lal inah lal Hezekia kuoma chun an hung a, “LALPA in po po, pumrawhmang thilinhlânna mâichâm le chutaka a bûr le bêlhai po po leh, entirna bei siena dawkân le chutaka a bûr le bêlhai po po leh, kan sukthieng vawng tah a."
19,"Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.","Chunawa chun, bûr le bêl po po, Ahaz rorêl laia a bawsiet laia a dêhâwn po pohai kha kan buotsai a, kan inhlân thieng ta bawk a; ngai ta, tuhin LALPA mâichâm hmaa chun an um a nih,” an ta."
20,"Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lal Hezekia chu in- hmatakin a tho vak a, khuoa hotuhai chu a ko khâwm a; LALPA ina chun a hang fe tah a."
21,"And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.","Chun, bâwngchal pasari, be- râmchal pasari, berâmte pasari le, kêlchal pasari Juda mihai le hmun inthieng le ram ta dinga suol thilin- hlân dingin an hung lâk a. Chuong- chun, Aron naupasal thiempuhai chu LALPA mâichâm chunga chuonghai chu inhlân dingin thu a pêk a."
22,"So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.","Chuongchun, bâwngchalhai chu an hang that a, thiempuhai chun a thisen chu an indawh a; mâichâm chunga chun an theh a; berâmchal khawm chu an that a, a thisen chu mâichâm chunga chun an theh a; berâmtehai khawm chu an that a, a thisen chu mâichâm chunga chun an theh a."
23,And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them:,"Chun, lal le mipuihai hmaa chun suol thilinhlâna dingin kêlchal- hai chu an hung lâk hnai a; an kuthai chu an chunga chun an in nghat a;"
24,"and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel.","thiempuhai chun an that a, an thisen chun mâichâm chunga chun suol thilinhlân chu an inhlân tah a, Israel mi po po ta dinga intlanna siempêk dingin pumrawhmang thil- inhlân le suol thilinhlân chu Israel mi po po ta dinga thaw ding a nih tiin lal chun thu a lo pêk ta sih a."
25,"And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.","Chun, zâwlnei Nathan hai, lal zâwlnei Gad hai le David thupêk ang tak khan Levi mihai chu LALPA ina chun dârbenthekhai leh, perkhuong- hai leh, ṭingṭanghai leh ân umtir a; thupêkhai chu a zâwlneihai hmanga LALPA pêk a ni sih a."
26,"And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.","Chun, Levi mihai chu David thil rimawi siemhai le chun an ngîr a, thiempuhai chu tawtawrâwthai leh."
27,"And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.","Chun, Hezekia chun pumraw- hmang thilinhlân chu mâichâm chunga chun inhlân dingin thu a pêk a. Chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu ṭan a ni ruol chun, LALPA hlahai, tawtawrâwthai, Israel lal David thil rimawi siemhai le chun ṭan an ni ve vawng tah a."
28,"And all the assembly worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt-offering was finished.","Chun, mipui po po chun Pathien chibai an bûk a, hlasaktuhaiin an sak a, tawtawrâwt puhai chun an mût a; chuong po po chu pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu zo a ni hmakhat chu thaw zing a na."
29,"And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.","Thilinhlân chu an suktâwp chun lal le a kâwla mihai po po chu an kûn a, chibai an bûk a."
30,"Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.","Chu nawa khawm lal Hezekia le hotuhai chun Levi mihai chu Zâwlnei Asaph le David hla phuok chun LALPA inpâkna chu sak dingin thu an pêk bawk a. Chun, lâwmtakin inpâkna hla chu an sak a, an luhai an kûn a, chibai an bûk a."
31,"Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt-offerings.","Chun, Hezekia chun a dawn a, “Tuhin chu LALPA kuoma chun in inpêk tah a, hung hnai unla, lâwmna thilinhlânhai le inthâwinahai chu LALPA ina chun hung inhlân ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, mipuihai le inthâwi- nahai chu an hung inhlân a; chun, mi a nuom zât zât chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân khawm chu an hung lâk bawk a."
32,"And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.","Mipuiin pumrawhmang thilin- hlân an hung lâk zât chu bâwngchal sâwmsari, berâmchal za khat, berâmte za hni an na; hienghai po po hi LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilinhlân dinga pêk an nih."
33,And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.,"Chun, thil a pêka pumpêk chu bâwngchal za ruk le berâm sâng thum an nih."
34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.","Nisienlakhawm, thiempuhai chu an tlâwm leiin pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai po po chu an inhlip hman nawh a, chuleiin, an unau Levi mihai chun sin chu zo fel a ni vawng chenin, anni thiempuhai an inthien chen chu an ṭhangpui tâwl a. (Levi mihai chu thiempuhai nêk chun inthien dingin lungrila chun an khermei lem sih a.)"
35,"And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.","Pumrawhmang thilinhlân tam tâwktak bâka chun inremna thilin- hlân thâuhai le pumrawhmang thilinhlân poa dâwnmi thilinhlânhai an um bawk a. Chuongchun, LALPA ina rawngbâwlna chu ân dawt peia siem fel chu a ni tah a."
36,"And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.","Chun, chuong mipuihai ta dinga Pathienin thil a buotsai ta leiin Hezekia le mipuihai khawm chu an hlim tah a; chuong thil chu inhmaw thuta thaw a ni sih a."
