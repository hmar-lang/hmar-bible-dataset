1,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.","Rehoboam chu Jerusalem a hung tlung chun Benjamin le Juda sûngkuo, nuoi khat le sîng riet, thlang ṭhieu, Israelhai do dinga indo mi, Rehoboam ta dinga ram chu hung la kîr nâwk dingin a ko khâwm tawl a."
2,"But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien mi Semaia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a,"
3,"Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,","“Judai ram lal Solomon naupa Rehoboam le, Judai rama Benjamin mihai le Israel mi po pohai kuoma chun thu hril la,"
4,"Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.","LALPAIN hieng hin a tih ti rawh, ‘Hang fe nâwng in ta, in unauhai chu indopui bawk nâwng in tih: mi tin chu mâni in sengah kîr nâwk el ro: hi thil hi keima thaw a ni sih a,’ tiin,” a ta. Chuongchun, LALPA thu chu an zâwm a, Jeroboam hang do tumnaa inthawk chun an kîr tah a."
5,"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.","Rehoboam chu Jerusalema chun a um a, Judai rama inhumhimna dingin khawpuihai a bâwl a."
6,"He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,","Bethlehem dâm, Etam dâm, Tekoa dâm,"
7,"And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,","Beth-zur dâm, Soko dâm, Adullam dâm,"
8,"and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,","Gath dâm, Maresah dâm, Ziph dâm,"
9,"and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,","Adoraim dâm, Lakis dâm, Azeka dâm,"
10,"and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.","Zora dâm, Aijalon dâm, Hebron dâm, chuong chu Judai rama umhai le, Benjamin rama khawpui kul neihai a nih."
11,"And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.","Chun, kul dettakhai chu a sukdet nâwk zuol a, chuonga chun hotuhai a sieh a, fâk ding le hriek le uoin dâm ân khâwl bawk a."
12,"And in every city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.","Khaw tin hmun tamtaka chun feihai, phâwhai a sieh a, nasatak- in a sukhrât a. Judai hnam le Benjamin hnam chu ama tieng an ṭhang a."
13,And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.,Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu an umna sûnga inthawk chun ama kuomah Israel ram sûng po poa chun an hung pakai a.
14,"For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office unto Jehovah;","Levi mihai chun an ram le an khuohai chu an mâksan a, Jerusalem le Judai rama chun an hung a; Jeroboam le a naupasalhai chun anni chu LALPA ta dinga thiempu sinhai chu thaw lo dingin an hnawt suok sih a,"
15,"and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.","chuongchun, ama siem bâwng- têhai, kêlchalhai le bâwlhmunhaia ding chun thiempuhai a ruot fâwm tah a."
16,"And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Chun, an hnunga khawm chun, Israel hnamhai lai po poa mi, Israel Pathien LALPA chu lungrila zawng- tuhai chun an zui a; an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA kuoma inthâwi ding chun Jerusalemah an hung hlak a."
17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.","Chuongchun, kum thum sûng chun Judai lalram chu an sukdet tiel tiel a, Solomon naupa Rehoboam chu ân sukdet hle el tah a; kum thum sûng chu David le Solomon lampui chu an hraw sih a."
18,"And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;","Chun, Rehoboam chun David naupa Jerimoth le Jesai naupa Eliab naunu Abihail naunu Mahalath chu nuhmeiah a nei a;"
19,"and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.",amanu chun naupasalhai a neipêk a; Jeus le Semaria le Zaham.
20,"And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.","Ama hnunga chun Absalom naunu Maaka chu a nei a; ama chun Abija, Attai, Ziza le Selomith a nei- pêk a."
21,"And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters).","Chun, Rehoboam chun a nu- hmeihai le a thaikêmhai po po nêkin Absalom naunu Maaka chu a hmangai lem a, (nuhmei chu sâwm- pariet a nei a, thaikêm sâwmruk leh; chun, naupasal sâwmhni pariet le naunuhmei sâwmruk a nei bawk sih a)."
22,"And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, even the prince among his brethren; for he was minded to make him king.","Chun, Rehoboam chun Maaka naupa Abija chu lalah, a unauhai laia hotutakah a ruot a; ama chu lala siem a lungril sih a."
23,"And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought for them many wives.","Chun, vartakin a thawh a, Juda le Benjamin ram po poa chun a nau- pasalhai chu a semdar rak a, khaw- pui kul neihai po poa chun; fâk ding khawm tam tâwk takin a pêk bawk a. An ta dingin nuhmeihai khawm tamtak a zawngpêk bawk a."
