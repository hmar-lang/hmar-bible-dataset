1,"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Hezekia chun Israel Pathien LALPA fekân ruoiṭhe chu hmang dingin Jerusalema LALPA ina chun in hung ding a nih tiin Israel le Juda mihai po po kuomah mi a tir a, chun, Manasse le Ephraim mihai kuoma khawm lekha a ziek bawk a."
2,"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.","Chun, thla hninaa fekân ruoiṭhe chu nei dingin Lal le a miṭhahai le Jerusalema mipui inkhâwmhai po po le chun an rawt a."
3,"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.","A hun pângngaia chun nei khawm an nei thei naw hrim a, thiempuhai chu a tam huntâwkin an inthien thei nawh; mipuihai chu Jerusalema chun an hung khâwm bawk naw leiin."
4,And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.,"Chun, chu thil chu lal le mipuihai ngaia chun ân dik a."
5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.","Chuongchun, Israel Pathien LALPA fekân ruoiṭhe chu hmang dingin Jerusalemah an hung ding a nih tiin, Israel ram po po Beer-sebaa inthawka Dan chenin thupuong siem dingin thupêk ân suoh a; ziek a ni angin, chuong anga tam chun an la hmang ngai si nawh a."
6,"So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.","Chuongchun, dâkpuhai chu lal thupêk ang takin lal le a hotuhaia inthawk chun lekhahai chawiin Juda le Israel ram sûng po poa chun an fe tah a; “Nangni Israel thlahai, nangni Assuria lalhai kuta inthawk a suokdawkhai a la um sun- hai tieng hi a hung ngha kîr theina dingin, Israel le, Isaak le Abraham Pathien, LALPA tieng chu hung ngha nâwk ro."
7,"And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.","Nangni chu in thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chunga bawsetu inthlatuhai le in unauhai ang kha chu ni naw unla, chuong lei chun sietnaah anni chu a pêk suok tah a ni kha in hmuh a."
8,"Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.","In thlatuhai an ni angin mi kâwmâwhai ni naw unla; nangni chu LALPA kuomah inpe lem ro; kum- khuoa dinga sukthieng tah, a hmun inthienga chun lût unla, nangnia inthawka a lungsenna ṭiumtak chu ân kieng theina dingin LALPA in Pathien rawng chu bâwl ro."
9,"For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.","LALPA kuom tieng in nghakîr nâwk chun, in unauhai le in thlahaiin sala ṭhuoituhai hmaa chun lungin- sietna dawng an ta, hi rama hin hung nâwk an tih, ama kuomah in kîr phawt chun LALPA in Pathien ngilneitak le zângai theitak a na, nghatsan naw ni cheu,” tiin."
10,"So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.","Chun, dâkpuhai chu khaw tina Ephraim le Manasse ram sûng po po Zebulun chenin an fe pei a; amiruok- chu, hmusitin an lo nuisan a, an lo nuiêu a."
11,"Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.","Nisienlakhawm, Aser le Manas- se le Zebulun hnama mi ṭhenkhat chu an insukhnuoi a, Jerusalema chun an hung a."
12,"Also upon Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Jehovah.","Chun, Juda rama khawm chun LALPA thua hotuhai le lal thupêk ang chu thaw dingin inthuruolna Pathienin a pêk a."
13,"And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.","Chun, a thla hninaa chun, mi- pui nasatak el chu, chawlṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe chu hmang dingin Jerusalema chun an inkhâwm tah a."
14,"And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.","Chun, an tho a, Jerusalema mâichâm umhai le, riminhnik râwna mâichâmhai po po chu an lâk a, Kidron vadungtêa chun an pei tah a."
15,"Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.","Chun, a thla hnina ni sâwm- palinaa chun fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu an that a; thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu an inzak a, anni chu an inhlân thieng a. LALPA ina chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân chu an hung lâk lût tah a."
16,"And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.",Pathien mi Mosie dân ang peiin an indawtzie ang peiin an hmuna chun an ngîr a; thiempuhai chun thisen Levi mihai kuta inthawka an hmuhai chu an theh a.
17,"For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah.","Mipui inkhâwmna laia chun mâni insukthieng lo mi tamtak chu an um sih a; chuleiin, Levi mihai chun, LALPA kuoma anni chu in- hlânthieng dingin ân thieng nawhai taphawt fekân ruoiṭhena ding an thatpêk a."
18,"For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one","Mipui tamtak elhai, Ephraim le Manasse le Issakar le Zebulun mi tamtak elhai chu insukthieng lo an na, ziek a ni ang tho khan fekân ruoiṭhe chu an fâk a. Hezekia chun a lo ṭawngṭai pêk tah a, “LALPA ṭha chun ngaidam raw se, tukhawm"
19,"that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.","hmun inthieng inthien dân anga, thieng lo khawm ni sienla, Pathien, a thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu zawng dinga a lungril a lo innghat ta phawt chu,” tiin."
20,"And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Hezekia ṭawngṭaina chu a lo ngai a, mipuihai khawm chu a lo sukdam tah a."
21,"And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, singing with loud instruments unto Jehovah.","Chun, Israel thlahai Jerusalem- a umhai chun chawlṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe chu ni sari sûng lâwmtakin an hmang tah a, chun, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu ni tin tinin LALPA kuoma thil sutrîktheihaia hlasakin LALPA chu an inpâk a."
22,"And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding in the service of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","LALPA rawngbâwlna sina thiemtaka thaw Levi mihai kuoma chun Hezekia chun thlamuonna thu a hril a. Chuongchun, ni sari sûng chu inremna thilinhlânhai chu inhlânin le, LALPA an thlatuhai Pathien kuoma chun thupha chawina siemin, ruoiṭhe sûng po po chun an fâk a."
23,And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness.,"Chun, mipui inkhâwmhai po po chun ni dang la hmang nâwk dingin an remti a, ni sari dang chu lâwm- takin an la hmang nâwk a."
24,For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.,"Juda ram lal Hezekia chun mipui inkhâwmhai chu inhlân dingin bâwngchal sâng khat le, berâm sâng sari a pêk a; chun, hotuhai chun mipuihai chu bâwngchal sâng khat le berâm sîng khat an pêk bawk a, thiempu tam tawk tak el chu an insukthieng bawk a."
25,"And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.","Chun, Juda mipuihai po po, thiempuhai leh, Levi mihai leh, Israel rama inthawka mipui hunghai po po leh, Israel rama inthawka mikhuol hunghai po po leh, Juda rama umhai le chun an hlim hle tâwl a."
26,So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.,"Chuongchun, Jerusalema chun nasataka hlimna a um a, Israel lal David naupa Solomon hun china khan chu chuong ang chu Jerusalem- ah a um ngai nawh a."
27,"Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.","Chun, thiempuhai, Levi mihai chu an tho a, mipuihai chu mal an sâwmpêk a; an râwlhai chu hrietin a um a, an ṭawngṭainahai chu a umna inthieng vâna chun a hang tlung a."
