1,"Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.","Chun, Solomon chun a hril a, “LALPA chun inthim sâmupa chun um ka tih a ta."
2,"But I have built thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever.","Nisienlakhawm, kumkhuoa chêng- na dinga hmun i ta dingin, i ta dinga umna ding in ka bâwlpêk ta che hi,” a ta."
3,"And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.","Chun, lal chu a ngha kîr a, Israel inkhâwmhai po po chu mal a sâwm a; Israel mipuihai po po chu an ngîr ṭhup a."
4,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, saying,","Chun, ama chun a hril a, “Israel- hai Pathien LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se, ka pa David kuoma a baua thu lo hril a, a bânhaia lo sukpui- tlingtu chu:"
5,"Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:","ama chun, ‘Aigupta rama in- thawka ka mihai ka ṭhuoi suok nia inthawk tah, Israel hnam po po laia inthawkin, ka hming um zingna dinga in bâwlna dingin khawpui ka ruot nawh a; ka mi Israelhai chunga lala um dingin tukhawm ka thlang bawk nawh;"
6,"but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.","amiruokchu, ka hming umna dingin Jerusalem kha ka thlang a, chun, ka mi Israelhai chunga um dingin David chu ka lo thlang tah a,’ tiin."
7,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chuongchun, ka pa David lung- rila chun Israelhai Pathien LALPA hminga in bâwl nuomna a um a."
8,"But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:","Amiruokchu, LALPA chun ka pa David kuoma chun, ‘Ka hming dingin, in bâwl dingin lungril i nei a ni âwm a; hieng i lungrila um hi i thaw ṭha ngawt el;"
9,"nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.","amiruokchu, in chu nang chun bâwl naw ti nih a, i naupa, i ṭhâla hung pieng ding chun, ka hmingin in chu bâwl lem a tih,’ a ta."
10,"And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun thu a hril ta chu a hung puitling pei a; ka pa David hmuna chun ka hung ngîr tah a, LALPAIN a lo tiem ta angin Israel ram lal ṭhungphaa chun ka ṭhung tah a, Israelhai Pathien LALPA hming ding chun in chu ka bâwl ta a nih."
11,"And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.","Chun, chutaka chun bâwm chu kân ṭhut tah a, Israel thlahai le LALPAIN thuthlung a lo siem tahai chu chu sûnga chun a um nghe ngheh a,” tiin."
12,"And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands","Chun, Israel mipui inkhâwmhai po po hmaihmaah, LALPA mâichâm hmaah a ngîr a, a bânhai chu a phar a;"
13,"(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven);","(Solomon chun dârsen ṭham tawng ngaa sei, tawng nga bawka lien, tawng thuma insâng a siem a, tuollai sûnga a laitaka a ilo daw ta chunga chun a ngîr a, Israel inkhâwmhai po po hmaa chun a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a kuthai chu vân tieng a phar a nih.) ama chun a hril a;"
14,"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;","“Aw LALPA Israelhai Pathien, an lungril po poa i hmaa khawsa hlakhai i siehlawhai chunga zângai- na le thuthlung kawl zingtu nang ang hi, hnuoi le vâna khawm Pathien dang an um dêr nawh a;"
15,"who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.","i siehlaw ka pa David kuoma khawm i thutiemhai chu i sukpui- tling a; anih, i bauin i hril a, vawisûn ni ang bawk hin, i kuthai chun i sukpuitling hlak ta kha."
16,"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me.","Chuleiin, tuhin aw LALPA, Israelhai Pathien, ‘Ka hmaa i khaw- sak anga, ka dân hraw dinga i thlahaiin an pawi sa chun; ka mit- hmuah Israel lal ṭhungphaa ṭhung ding mi intlâksamtir naw ning che,’ tiha ka pa David i siehlaw kuoma i lo tiem ta kha hung hre zing rawh."
17,"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David.","Chuleiin, tuhin, aw LALPA Israelhai Pathien, i siehlaw David kuoma i thu i lo hril ta chu sukdet ni raw se."
18,"But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded!","Nisienlakhawm, thilthaw tin- rêngah mihriemhai lai Pathien chu a khawsa ding am a nih? Ngai ta, vân le vânhai vân khawm chun nang chu a dâwl naw che a nih; hi in ka bâwl lem hi chu a chîn nasa âwm de!"
19,"Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;","I hmaa i siehlaw hnina, ṭawng- ṭaina le kona chu lo ngai dingin, Aw LALPA ka Pathien, a hnina le i siehlaw ṭawngṭaina chu i lo ngai- sak a;"
20,"that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.","i hmun tieng nghaa i siehlaw hin a ṭawngṭai pha, ṭawngṭaina chu lo ngai dingin, ‘Chutaka chun ka hming chu sieng ka tih,’ i tina hmun tieng ngei chu, chu in tienga chun a sûn a zâna i mit chu în lên theina dingin."
21,"And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.","Hi hmun tieng hi nghaa an ṭawngṭai pha chun i mi Israelhai le i siehlaw hnina chu lo ngai la; anih, i umna vâna inthawk ngei chun lo hre la; chun, i lo hriet chun ngaidam bawk la."
22,"If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before thine altar in this house;","“Miin a tuolbâwm chungah thil a suksuol a, vânni khâm dinga inkhâmtira um ding a lo ni chun, hi ina hin a hung a, i mâichâm hmaa hin a hung inkhâm chun;"
23,"then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.","nang chun vâna inthawkin lo ngai la, thaw la, mi suol chu ama lu chung ngeia a maw phura thungin, i siehlawhai chungthu chu hung rêl rawh; ân dikna ang peia pêka um dingin mi fel chu thiem hung in- changtir bawk la."
24,"And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;","Chun, i mi Israelhai hi an hmêlmahai hmaa chun i chunga an suolna leia hnein lo um hai sienla, hung ngha kîrin, i hming an hung ṭan a, hi ina hin an ṭawngṭaia hnina an hung siem chun;"
25,"then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.","nangin vâna inthawk chun lo hre la, i mi Israelhai suol chu ngai- dam la, an thlatuhai le anni kuoma i pêk rama chun hung ṭhuoi nâwk rawh."
26,"When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:","I chungah thil an suksuol leiin, ruo sûr loin vân chu lo ping ta sienla, hi hmun tieng nghaa an ṭawngṭai a, i hming an ṭan a, anni chu i hrem laia an suol chu an nghatsan chun,"
27,"then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.","vâna chun lo hre la, an fena ding lampui ṭha închûktir lai chun i siehlawhai le i mi Israelhai suol chu nangin lo ngaidam la; i mihai kuoma rochan dinga i pêk, chu ram chunga chun ruo insûrtir rawh."
28,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be;","Chun, chu rama chun ṭâm amanih a tlah a, hri amanih ân lêng a, riel amanih, ṭêk amanih, khâu amanih, tuktulung amanih an ṭuong chun; an hmêlmahai chun an khaw- puiahai chun anni chu hung inhuol hai sienla, ieng hripui khawm in- lêngin, ieng natna khawm um sienla;"
29,"what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house:","i mi Israelhai po poin amanih, mi tukhawmin amanih hnina le ṭawngṭaina ieng ang khawm lo siem ta sienla, mi tin mâni hri ngei hretu le, mâni lungngaina ngei hretuin hi in tieng hin a bânhai a phar suok chun,"
30,"then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men);","i umna vâna inthawk chun nangin lo hre la, ngaidam la, mi tin chu, a lungril chu nangin i hriet a, a lampuihai ang po po ngei chun nangin inhmutir rawh; (nang chun, nang chauin mihriem nauhai lungril chu i hriet sih a;)"
31,"that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.",kan thlatuhai kuoma i pêk rama an um sûng po poa i lampuihai chu hraw dinga nangma chu an ṭi theina ding chein.
32,"Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:","“Chu nawah i mi Israel mi ni lo, mikhuol chungthua chun; i kut phar lei le, i kut thahrât lei le, i hming ropui leia ram hlataka inthawka a hung chun; an hung a hi in tieng nghaa an ṭawngṭai pha chun;"
33,"then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.","i umna hmun vâna inthawk ngei chun lo hre la, mikhuolin a hung kona san tak ang che chu thawpêk rawh; hnuoi chunga mi po pohai chun i mi Israelhai anga, hi in ka bâwl hi i hming a put ti an hriet theina dingin le, i hming ropui chu an hriet a an ṭi theina ding chein."
34,"If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;","I mihai chu an hmêlmahai chunga do dingin fe suok hai sienla, khaw tieng lampuia mani khawm nangin lo tir ta la, i hming dinga in ka ibâwl le, hi khawpui nangin i thlang tieng hi nghaa an ṭawngṭai chun:"
35,"then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.","vâna inthawk chun an ṭawng- ṭaina le hnina chu lo ngai la, an thu chu nangin ṭan rawh."
36,"If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;","I chungah thil an suksuol a, (mi thil suksuol lo an um si nawh a) an chungah i lung a sen a, hmêlma kutah i pêk a, ram hlaa manih, a hnaia manih anni chun sala an ṭhuoi hmang chun:"
37,"yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;","sala ṭhuoihmanga an umna rama chun anni chu an inngaituoh a, an hung ngha kîr a, sal an nina rama chun nanga kuomah hnina an hung siem a; ‘Thil kan suk suol tah a, rilotakin kan thaw tah a, khawhlo- takin kan lo thaw tah a nih,’ tiha;"
38,"if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:","sala an umna rama an lungril po po le an lungvar po poa nangma kuoma an hung ngha kîr a, sala ṭhuoihmang an nina hmuna chun i hming dinga in ka bâwl tieng le, nangin khawpui i thlang tieng le, an thlatuhai kuoma ram i pêkna tieng nghaa an ṭawngṭai chun;"
39,"then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.","i umna hmun vâna inthawk ngei chun, an hnina le an ṭawngṭaina chu lo hre la, nangin an thu chu ṭan la, i chunga thil suksuol i mihai chu nangin ngaidam rawh."
40,"Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.","Tuhin, aw ka Pathien, ka ngên che, hi hmuna ṭawngṭaina hi, i mitin hmu sienla, i na chun lo ngai raw se."
41,"Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.","Aw LALPA Pathien tuhin tho la, i châwlna hmuna chun nang le, i hrâtna bâwm chu; Aw LALPA Pathien, i thiempuhai chu sandam- nain inthuomhai sienla, i mi in- thienghai chu ṭhatnaah hlim raw hai se."
42,"O Jehovah God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember thy lovingkindnesses to David thy servant.","Aw LALPA Pathien, i hriek nâl hmai chu innghat hmangtir naw la, i siehlaw David thilthaw ṭhathai chu hre zing rawh,” tiin."
