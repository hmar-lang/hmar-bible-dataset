1,"Then Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where Jehovah appeared unto David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Chun, Solomon chun Moria tlânga a pa David kuoma LALPA chu ân lâr a, Davidin a lo buotsaina hmun, Jebus mi Ornan hrizâwla a lo thlangna hmun Jerusalema chun LALPA in bâwl chu a ṭan tah a."
2,"And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.","A rorêl a kum lina, a thla hnina, a ni hninaa chun a bâwl ṭan a."
3,"Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.","Pathien in bâwlna dinga Solo- monin a lungphûm a phûmhai chu hienghai hi an nih: a dungtieng chu tawnga inkhiin inkhina hmasa dâna chun tawng sâwmruk a na, a khang- tieng chu tawng sâwmhni a nih."
4,"And the porch that was before the house, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.","Chun, a tuolpûk inpui hmaa mi chu, a dung chu a in khangtieng chen chie, tawng sâwmhni a na, ân sâng- tieng chu tawng za le sâwmhni a na, a sûng chu rângkachak inthiengin ân luon khum a."
5,"And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.","A in lien lem chu fâr thingin ân khum a, rângkachak inthiengin ân luon khum a, a chunga chun intûm thinghai le khaidiet limhai a siem a."
6,And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.,"Mawina dingin in chu lunghlu- haiin a cheimawi a, a rângkachakhai khawm chu Parvaim rângkachak an nih."
7,"He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.","Chutaka a kawtkhârhai, chutaka banghai le kalhai le ṭuong le chu in chu rângkachakin ân luon khum bawk a; bangahai chun cherub limhai a ker bawk a."
8,"And he made the most holy house: the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.","Chun, hmun inthieng tak chu a siem bawk a; chu a dungtieng chu a inpui khangtieng ang chiein, tawng sâwmhni a na; a khang khawm chu tawng sâwmhni bawk a nih; chun, rângkachak inthieng talent za ruk laiin ân luon khum bawk a."
9,And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.,"Chun, a kilna rikzie chu râng- kachak shekel sâwmnga tluk a nih. A pindan chunghnunghai chu rângka- chakin ân luon khum a."
10,And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.,In inthiengtaka chun cherub pa- hni a lima cherin a siem a; chuonghai chu rângkachakin ân luon khum a.
11,"And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.","Cherubhai thla chu tawng sâwmhnia sei a na; cherub pakhat thla chu, a in bang va sukin tawng nga a na, a thla khing tieng chu tawng nga bawk a na; cherub dang thla kha a va suk a."
12,"And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.","Chun, cherub pakhat dang thla khawm chu bang va tâwkin tawng nga a na, a thla dang pakhat chun cherub thla dang kha va zawmin tawng nga a ni ve bawk a."
13,"The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.","Chuongchun, hieng cherub thlahai hin tawng sâwmhni chu an zârhlie a; an kehaiin an ngîr a; an hmaihai chu insûng tieng chu an nghah a."
14,"And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.","Chun, puonzâr dumpâwl le a senêm le, a senduk le puon zai inhmi a siem a, a chunga chun cherubhai ân chuon bawk a."
15,"Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.","Chun, in hmatienga chun sût- pui pahni tawng sâwmthum pangaa insâng ve ve a siem a, chuong a lêr- tâwpa a hmawrbâwkhai chu tawng nga ve ve an ni bawk a."
16,"And he made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.","Chun, hmun inthienga chun khaidiethai a siem a, chuong sût- puihai lêra chun a thlung a; chun, theibufai za khat a siem bawk a, chuong chu khaidieta chun a khai tâwl a."
17,"And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.","Biekin tuola chun chuong sût- puihai chu a phun a, pakhat chu changtieng, a dang chu vawitieng; chun, chu changtienga mi chu a hmingah Jakin ân bûk a, vawitienga mi chu a hmingah Boaz ân bûk bawk a."
