1,And Josiah kept a passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.,Josia chun LALPA kuoma fekân ruoiṭhe chu Jerusalema chun a hmang a; thla hmasa tak ni sâwmpali ni chun fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu an that a.
2,"And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.","Thiempuhai chu an sinthawahai chun a ruot a, LALPA in rawngbâwl- naa ding chun ân fui tâwl a."
3,"And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God, and his people Israel;","LALPA ta dinga inthieng Israel po po inchûktir hlak Levi mihai kuom a chun, “Israel lal David naupa Solomonin in a bâwla khan Thu- thlungna bâwm inthieng chu sie ro; in liengkoahai zâwn ngâi ta naw nih a; tuhin in Pathien LALPA le a mi Israelhai rawng chu bâwl ro."
4,"and prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.","Nangni khawm Israel lal David ziek ang le, a naupa Solomon ziek ang tak khan an pahnam ang peiin in pâwl bi chu insiem unla."
5,"And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brethren the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a father’s house of the Levites.","Chun, Levi hnam inṭhe dân ang pei le, in unau mipuihai pahnam in- ṭhe dân ang pei chun hmun inthienga chun ngîr unla."
6,"And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses.","Chun, fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu that unla, nangni le nangni chu in- hlân thieng ro; Mosie hmanga LALPA thu ang tak kha thaw dingin in unauhai ta ding khawm chun buotsai bawk unla,” a ta."
7,"And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king’s substance.","Chun, Josia chun chu hnam thlahai, a umhai po kuoma chun ran ruol laia mi berâmte dâm, kêlte dâm sîng thum le bâwngchal sâng thum fekân ruoiṭhenaa inhlân dingin a pêk a; hi hi lal suma mi a nih."
8,"And his princes gave for a freewill-offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.","Chun, a hotuhai chun Levi mihai le thiempuhai le mipui kuoma chun nuom thua thilinhlân dinghai chu an pêk bawk a. Hilkia le Zekaria le Jehiel, Pathien in rorêltuhai chun thiempuhai kuoma chun fekân ruoi- ṭhena dingin ran chîn sâng hni le za ruk le, bâwngchal za thum an pêk a."
9,"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.","Konania le a unauhai Semaia le Nethanel le, Levi mihai hotuhai Hasabia le, Jeiel le, Jozabad chun Levi mihai kuomah fekân ruoiṭhenaa thilinhlân dingin ran ruol chîn sâng nga le bâwngchal za nga an pêk bawk a."
10,"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king’s commandment.","Chuongchun, rawngbâwlna chu buotsai a ni tah a, lal thupêk ang tak chun thiempuhai chu an hmuna chun an ngîr a, Levi mihai chu an pâwl dân ang peiin an thaw tah a."
11,"And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.","Chun, fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu an that a, thiempuhai chun an kutin thisen chu an theh a, Levi mihai chun an inhlip a."
12,"And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlânhai chu an sie hmang a, Mosie lekhabua ziek anga LALPA kuoma inhlân dinga, chu hnam thlahai pahnam inṭhe dân ang peia an pêk suok theina dingin. Chuongchun, bâwngchalhai khawm chu chuong ang bawk chun an thawh a."
13,"And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.","Chun, fekân ruoiṭhena ding chu dân ang peiin meiah an em hmin a, chun, thilinhlân inthienghai sa kha chu bêlhai le, bêl bau ûmhai le, bêl indarhaiin an suong a, mi po pohai kuoma chun inhmâwtakin an fepui tah a."
14,"And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.","Chun, chu hnunga chun anni ta ding le thiempuhai ta ding chun an buotsai tah a; Aron naupasalhai thiempuhai chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân le a thâuhai chu zân chen- in an buoipui tah a; chuleiin, Levi mihai chun anni le Aron naupasal thiempuhai ta ding chun an buotsai el a nih."
15,"And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.","Chun, David le Asaph le Heman le lal zâwlnei Jeduthun thupêk angin hlasaktuhai, Asaph naupasalhai chu an hmuna chun an um a; chun, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu dâi kawt- khâr tina chun an um bawk a; an sinthawhai chu an mâksan a ṭûl nawh a, an unau Levi mihai chun an ta dingin an buotsaipêk leiin."
16,"So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah.","Chuongchun, lal Josia thupêk angin, LALPA rawngbâwlna po po chu ni khat sûngin, fekân ruoiṭhe hmang ding le LALPA mâichâm chunga pumrawhmang thilinhlân inhlân ding chu, buotsai vawng a ni tah a."
17,"And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.","Chun, Israel thlahai chutaka umhai chun chu nia chun fekân ruoi- ṭhe chu an hmang a, chawlṭhanglo bei ruoiṭhe chu ni sari an hmang bawk a."
18,"And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Zâwlnei Samuel hun laia inthawk ta khan chuonga fekân ruoi- ṭhe chu Israel rama lal tu khawma Josiain a hmang ang hin an hmang ngai nawh a, thiempuhai le Levi mihai le, Israel le Juda chutaka umhai po po le, Jerusalema chênghai khawma an hmang ngai nawh a."
19,In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.,Josia rorêl a kum sâwmpariet- naa chun a nih a hi fekân ruoiṭhe hi hmanga a um chu.
20,"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.","Hieng po po hnunga hin, Josia chun biekin chu a siem ṭha zo chun Aigupta lal Neko chu Euphrates vadung panga Karkemis chu rûn dingin a hang feh a; Josia chu ama tuok ding chun a fe suok tah a."
21,"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun aiâwtuhai a hung tir a, a kuomah, “Nang Juda lal, nang hi iengtin am ka thaw ding che a na? Vawisûn hi nang do ding chein ka hung nawh a, amiruokchu, indona ka neipuihai chu do dingin a ni lem ka hung; chun, Pathien chun inhmaw dingin thu a mi pêk a, Pathien chu sukbuoi lo dingin insûm hrâm la, ama chu ka kuomah a um a, sukbohmang rawi a ti che,” tiin."
22,"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.","Nisienlakhawm, Josia chun ama chu a kîrsan chuong nawh a, ama chu a do ngei theina dingin, ân sukdanglam a; Pathien baua in- thawka Neko thu chu a ngaisak nawh a, ama chu Megiddo ruoma do ding chun a suok tah a."
23,"And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.","Chun, thal kâp mihai chun Josia chu an kâp a, chun, lal chun a siehlaw kuoma chun, “Ka hliem nasa hle el sih a, mi sie hmang ro khai,” a ta."
24,"So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.","Chuongchun, a siehlawhai chun sakawr tawlailîra inthawk chun an lâk suok a, a sakawr tawlailîr danga chun an sieh a, Jerusalemah an hung ṭhuoi tah a; a thih a, a thlatuhai thlân ina chun phûmin a um tah a, Juda le Jerusalem po poin Josia chu an sûn a."
25,"And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.","Chun, Jeremia khawm chun Josia chu a sûn a; vawisûn ni chen hin, hlasaktu pasal le hlasaktu nuhmeihai khawm chun Josia an sûnna hla chu an lân sam a; Israel rama chun thupêkhaiah an siem a, chuong chu, ngai ta, sûnnaa chun ziek an nih."
26,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,","Josia thilthaw danghai le, a thilthaw ṭhathai chu, LALPA dâna ziek ang tak chun,"
27,"and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.","a thilthawhai a hmasatak le a nuhnungtak chu, ngai ta, Juda le Israel ram lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a nih."
