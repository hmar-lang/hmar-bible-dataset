1,"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.","Chun, chu ram mipuihai chun Josia naupa Jehoahaz chu an ṭhuoi a, a pa aia chun Jerusalema lalah an siem tah a."
2,Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.,Jehoahaz chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pathuma upa a na; Jerusalema chun thla thum sûng ro a rêl a.
3,"And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.","Aigupta lal chun ama chu Jeru- salema chun ân lalna a suktlâwm a, an ram chu rângkachak talent khat le tangkaruo talent za khat ân chawi- tir a."
4,"And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.","Chun, Aigupta lal chun a unaupa Eliakim chu Jerusalem le Juda ram chunga chun lalah a siem a; a hming chu Jehoiakim in a thleng tah a. Chun, Neko chun a unaupa Jehoahaz chu a ṭhuoi a, Aigupta ramah a fepui tah a."
5,Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.,"Jehoiakim chu rorêl a ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pangaa upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmpakhat sûng ro a rel a; a Pathien LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw chu a thawh a,"
6,"Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.","ama chu doin, Babulon lal Nebu- kadnezzar chu a hung a, thîrkawlhai- in a khuop a, Babulona ṭhuoi dingin."
7,"Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.","Nebukadnezzar chun LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai khawm chu Babulon tieng a phur hmang a, Babulona biekina chun a sie tâwl a."
8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.","Jehoiakim thil thaw danghai le, thil tirdakum a thawhai le, amaa hmua umhai chu, ngai ta, Juda le Israel ram lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a nih; chun, Jehoiakin, a naupa chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
9,Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.,"Jehoiakin chu rorêl a ṭan chun kum rieta upa a na, thla thum le ni sâwm sûng Jerusalema chun ro a rêl a. LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha nawhai chu a thawh a."
10,"And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.","Chun, kum hung inlet nâwka chun Nebukadnezzar chun mi a tir a, ama chu Babulonah, LALPA ina bûr le bêl ṭhahai le chun an hung ṭhuoi a, a unaupa Zedekia chu Juda le Jerusalem chunga chun lalah a siem tah a."
11,Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:,Zedekia chu rorêl a ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pakhata upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmpakhat sûng ro a rêl a;
12,and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Jehovah.,a Pathien LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw chu a thawh a; LALPA baua inthawka thuhriltu Jeremia hmaa khawm chun ama le ama chu ân sukhnuoi nawh a.
13,"And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Pathiena ṭawng inkhâmtirtu Nebukadnezzar chunga khawm chun a hel bawk a; Israel Pathien LALPA kuoma kîr dingin, a lungril a sukngar a, ân sukkâwmâw bawk a."
14,"Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.","Chu nawa khawm chun, khaw- hri be mihai tirdakumna po po angin mipuihai le thiempu lalhai khawm chun nasatakin an bawsiet a; Jerusalema LALPA in a sukthieng ta chu an sukpawrche tah a."
15,"And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:","A umna hmun le a mihai chu a lunginsiet leiin, an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chun an kuoma chun a tirkohai chu a tir a,"
16,"but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.","nisienlakhawm, Pathien tirko- hai chu an nuisan a, a thu chu an hmusit a, a zâwlneihai chu an nuiêu a, sukṭhat nâwk theina um ta lo hiel khawpa, mipuihai chunga LALPA lungsenna chu chawkthoa a um hiel chen chun."
17,"Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.","Chuleichun, an chunga chun Kaldai lal a hung tir a, anni chun hmun inthienghaia chun an tlang- vâlhai dâm kâwlhnâmin an that a, tlangvâl amanih, nunghâkhai ama- nih, upa amanih, tar amani chunga khawm lunginsietna an nei nawh a, chuongchun, an rêng chun a kutah a pêk a."
18,"And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.","Pathien ina bûr le bêlhai, a lien le chînhai khawm, LALPA ina ro siekhâwlhai, lal ina ro siekhâwlhai le, a hotuhai tahai chen khawm chun Babulon tieng a lâk vawng a."
19,"And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.","Chun, Pathien in chu an rawh a, Jerusalem kul chu an vuokchim a, chutaka a lal inhai po po chu meiin an rawh a, chutaka bûr le bêl ṭhahai po po chu an suksiet bawk a."
20,And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:,Kâwlhnâma inthawka lo suok tahai chu Babulon tieng a ṭhuoi a; Persia ram rorêl a ni chen khan anni chu a nauhai le ama siehlawhai an na;
21,"to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: for as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.","chu ram chun a châwlni a hmang hmakhat chu Jeremia baua LALPA thu kha sukfamkim a ni theina dingin; râusana a um sûng po chu châwlni chu a hmang a na, kum sâwmsari suktling dingin."
22,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,","Persia lal Kura inlal kum khat- naa chun, Jeremia baua LALPA thu sukfamkim a ni theina dingin, Persia lal Kura lungril chu LALPA chun a chawktho a, thuphuong a ram sûng po poa chun a siem a, zieka ziek khawmin a sie bawk a,"
23,"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.","“Persia lal Kura chun hieng ang hin a tih, Vâna Pathien LALPA chun hnuoi chunga ram po po chu a mi pêk a; Juda rama Jerusalema chun in bâwlpêk dingin a mi ruot tah a. Nangni laia ama mihai taphawt kuoma chun LALPA a Pathien chu um sienla, hang fe raw se,” tiin."
