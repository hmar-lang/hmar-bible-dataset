1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.","Seba lalnu chun Solomon chan- chin chu a lo hrietin, indawnna intak takhai le Solomon chu fie dingin rawi nasatak leh; sanghâwng- sei, riminhnik le rângkachak tamtak le lunghluhai phurtuhai le chun Jerusalema chun a hung a; chun, Solomon kuom a hung tlung chun, a lungrila umhai po po thua chun ama chu ân biekpui tah a."
2,And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not.,"Chun, Solomon chun ân dawn- nahai po po chu a dawn a, Solomon ihriet naw thil, a dawn thei naw iengkhawm a um nawh a."
3,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,","Chun, Seba lalnu chun Solomon varzie le, in a ibâwl ta le,"
4,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.","dawkâna a bu dâm, a siehlaw inṭhunghai le a rawngbâwltuhai ngîrzie dâm le, an incheinahai le, a no chawituhai le an incheinahai le, a kailâwn LALPA in a hang fena chu a hmu chun, amaa chun lungril dang hrim a um ta nawh a."
5,"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.","Chun, lal kuoma chun, “I varzie le i thilthawhai keia rama ka lo hriet thuthanghai hi ân dik ngei a ni hi."
6,"Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard.","Kei ngei ka hung a, ka mit ngeia ka hung hmu hma khan chu an thuhai ka lo ring nawh a; ngai ta, i varna nasatzie chenve khawm hi hril ka lo ni naw hi tie; i hminginthangna ka lo hriet hi i khûm dai a nih."
7,"Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.","I mihai chu an vângnei a nih, i siehlaw i hmaa ngîr zing zinga, i varna thu ngai hlakhai chu an va vângnei de!"
8,"Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.","LALPA i Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se; ama chun LALPA i Pathien ta dinga lal ni dinga lalṭhungphaa inṭhungtir che chu a lâwm zâwng tak a na; i Pathien chun Israelhai chu kumkhuoa tungding zing chu a nuom zâwng a ni leiin, indiktaka rorêlna chu nei dingin an chunga lalah a siem che a ni hi,” a ta."
9,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.","Ama chun lal chu rângkachak talent za le sâwmhni le, riminhnik tamtak le, lunghluhai a pêk a; Seba lalnuin Solomon kuoma a pêk ang hrim hrim riminhnik a la um ngai nawh."
10,"And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones.","Chun, Huram siehlawhai le Solomon siehlawhai Ophira in- thawka rângkachak hung phurtuhai khan algum thing le lunghlu an hung phur a."
11,"And the king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.","Chun, lal chun algum thing chu LALPA in ta ding le lal ina inhuonna ding le, hla saktuhai ta dinga per- khuong le ṭingṭanghai dingin a siem a; chuong ang hrim hrim chu Judai rama chun a hmain hmu a ni ngai nawh a."
12,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.","Chun, lal Solomon chun Seba lalnu kuoma chun a dit taphawt, a hni phawt chu amain a hung chawi ang ni lo phawt kha chu a pêk veh a. Chun, a kîr a, ama ram ngeia chun ama le a siehlawhai chu an fe tah a."
13,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,","Kum khat sûnga Solomon kuoma rângkachak hung lût bûk zât chu, rângkachak talent za ruk sâwmruk paruk a nih:"
14,besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.,"chu chu dâwrkaihai le sum dâwnghaiin an hung lâk lût tiemsa loin a nih; chun, Arabia rama lalhai po po le ram sûnga rorêltuhai po po chun Solomon kuomah rângkachak le tangka an hung lâk lût a."
15,And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.,"Chun, Solomon chun rângka- chak âwmphaw a suta sutin za hni a siem a, âwmphaw pakhata chun rângkachak sutphêk shekel za ruk a lût a."
16,And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.,"Chun, rângkachak a suta sutin phâw za thum a siem a, phaw pa- khata chun rângkachak sutphêk shekel za thum a lût a; chun, lal chun chuonghai chu Lebanon ramhnuoi inah a sieh a."
17,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.","Chunawa khawm, lal chun sai- ha lalṭhungpha a siem a, rângkachak inthiengin ân luon khum a."
18,"And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.","Chun, lalṭhungpha hang kaina chu kailâwn paruk sirpha rângka- chak seng lalṭhungphaa zawmnghet a na; chun, ṭhungna hmun sir khing ve vea chun sakeibaknei lim pahni an ngîr bawk a."
19,And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.,"Chun, kailâwn paruka chun sîr khatah sakeibaknei sâwm le pahni an ngîr a, a sîr khingtienga khawm chun; khâwlai rama khawm hieng anga siem hi a la um ngai nawh."
20,"And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.","Chun, lal Solomon dâwnna nohai po po chu rângkachak an na, Lebanon ramhnuoi ina bûr le bêlhai po po khawm chu rângkachak inthieng an nih, Solomon hun lai hin tangkaruo hin hlutna a nei rak nawh."
21,"For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.","Huram siehlawhai le Tarsisa fe hlak lal chun lawnghai inkawppui a nei sih a, kum thum dan peiah Tarsis lawnghai chu hungin rângkachak dâm, tangkaruo dâm, saiha dâm, zâwng dâm, ârawn dâm a hung phur hlak a."
22,So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.,"Chuongchun, lal Solomon chun hnuoia lalhai po po chu varna le hausaknaa chun a khûm a nih."
23,"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.","Chun, hnuoia lalhai po po chun Pathienin a lungrila varna a sie chu ngai dingin Solomon chu an hung pan huoi huoi hlak a."
24,"And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.","Chun, mi tin chun a thilpêk, rângkachak bûr le bêlhai, tangkaraw bûr le bêlhai,silfên dâm, râlthuom dâm, riminhnik dâm, sakawr dâm, sabengtung lien chi dâm, kum tina bituk angin an hung pêk seng hlak a."
25,"And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.","Chun, Solomon chun sakawrhai le sakawr tawlailîrhai ta dingin in sâng li le, sakawr chung chuong mi sîng khat le sâng hni a nei a; sakawr tawlailîr khawpuihaia le lal kuoma Jerusalema a siehai chu a nih a."
26,"And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.","Chun, lal po po vadungpuia inthawka Philistin mihai ram chenin, Aigupta ramri chena umhai chunga chun ro a rêl a."
27,"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.","Chun, lal chun a tam êm lei chun Jerusalema chun tangkaruo chu lung ang el le, Sidar thing chu phai- ruoma theichang thinghai ang elin a siem a."
28,"And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.","Chun, Aiguptaa inthawk le ram tina inthawkin Solomon ta dingin sakawrhai chu an hung lâk a."
29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?","Solomon thilthaw danghai, a hmasa le tâwpna chenin zâwlnei Nathan ziek chanchin bua le, Silon mi Ahija hrillâwknaa le, Nebat naupa Jeroboam chungthua zâwlnei Iddo thil hmulâwkahai chun ziek a ni naw am a nih?"
30,And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.,Solomon chun Israel po po chunga chun kum sâwmli Jerusalem- ah ro a rêl a.
31,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Solomon chu a thlatuhai kuomah a in a, a pa David khuoa chun phûm a ni tah a; a naupa Rehoboam chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
