1,"Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.","Solomonin ṭawngṭaina chu a suktâwp chun, vâna inthawkin mei a hung tlah a, inthâwinahai le pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu a kâng hmang a; LALPA ropuina chun in chu a suksip tah a."
2,"And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah’s house.",LALPA in chu LALPA ropuinaa suksipa a um leiin thiempuhai chu LALPA ina chun an lût thei nawh a.
3,"And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks unto Jehovah, saying, For he is good; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.","Mei a hung tla a, in chunga chun LALPA ropuina a um zing lai chu Israel thlahai chun an en zing a; tuolzâwla chun an hmaihaia hnuoi sikin an kûn a, chibai an bûk a; “Ama chu a ṭha sih a, a zângaina chu kum- khawtluonga um zing ding a nih,” tiin, LALPA chu lâwmthu an hril a."
4,Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah.,"Chun, lal le mipuihai po po chun LALPA hmaa chun inthâwina an inhlân a."
5,"And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.","Chun, lal Solomon chun bâwng- chal sîng hni le sâng hni le, berâm nuoi khat le sîng hniin inthâwina ân hlân a. Chuongchun, lal le mipuihai po po chun Pathien in chu an inhlân tah a."
6,"And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks unto Jehovah (for his lovingkindness endureth for ever), when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.","Thiempuhai chu an sinthaw ang pei chun an ngîr a; an rawngbâwlnaa Davidin ân pâk laia, “A zângaina chu kumkhawtluongin a um zing sih a,” tia, LALPA inpâkna dinga lal Davidin LALPA thil rimawi thuomhnawhai a siemhai le chun Levi mihai chu an ngîr ve a; chun, thiempuhai chun an hmaa chun tawtawrâwt an hang mût a, Israel mihai po po chu an ngîr ta ṭhuop a."
7,"Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.","Chunawa khawm, Solomon chun LALPA in tuolsûng hmun lailung chu a sukthieng bawk a; Solomonin dârsen mâichâm a ilo siem ta chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân le, bu thil- inhlân le, a thâuhai chu a keng naw leiin, chutaka chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân le inremna thilinhlân thâuhai chu ân hlân sih a."
8,"So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun Israel mihai po po, mipui pung- khâwm nasatakhai, Aigupta vadung- têa inthawka Hamath lûtna chena mihai le chun ni sari sûng chu ruoi an ṭheh a."
9,"And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.","Chun, a ni riet ni chun in- khâwmna huntâwp chu an nei a; mâichâm inhlânna chu ni sari sûng khan an nei a, ni sari sûng ma chun ruoiṭhena an nei bawk a."
10,"And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.","Chuongchun, thla sarinaa ni sâwmhni pathum ni chun mipuihai chu an puon in tienghai chun, a mi Israelhai chunga le Solomon chunga le David chunga LALPAIN ṭhatna a lo inentirna lei chun lungrila lâwmtak le thafântak chun a tir kîr tah a."
11,"Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun lal in le LALPA in chu a zo tah a; LALPA in le ama ina thaw dinga Solomon lungrila um po pohai chu puitling takin a zo tah a."
12,"And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.","Chun, zâna chun LALPA chu Solomon kuomah a hung inlâr a, a kuomah, “I ṭawngṭaina ka lo hriet a, ka kuoma inthâwina in dingin hi hmun hi ka thlang tah a nih."
13,"If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;","Vân chu ka sukping a, ruo a sûr naw chun amanih, khâuhai chu ram chu fa zo dinga thu ka pêkin amanih, ka mihai laia hin hripui ka hung tîrin amanih;"
14,"if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.","ka mihai, ka hming chawia kohai chu an insukhnuoi a, an ṭawngṭai a, an lampui rilohai chu nghatsan a ka hmêl an hung zawng chun, vâna inthawk chun lo hrieng ka ta, an suol chu ngaidam ka ta, an ram khawm chu sukhrisêl bawk ka tih."
15,"Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.","Chuongchun, hi hmuna ṭawng- ṭaina inhlâna umhai chu, ka mithai chu meng ka ta, ka nahai chun ngai a tih."
16,"For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.","Kumkhawtluonga ka hming a um zing theina dingin hi in hi ka thlangin ka lo sukthieng ta sih a; chuongchun, ka mithai le ka lungril khawm chu chutaka chun um châm- chîng a tih."
17,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;","Chun, nanga chungthua chu thu ka pêk po pohai che ang peia i thaw a, i pa David khawsak anga ka hmaah i khawsa a, ka thuruothai le ka rorêlhai chu i zâwm chun;"
18,"then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.","‘Israel rama rorêltu ding intlâk- samtir naw ning che,’ tia i pa David kuoma thu ka lo thlung ta ang khan i lalram lalṭhungpha chu sukdet ka tih."
19,"But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;","Amiruokchu, i pêt hmang a, i hmaa thupêkhai le thuruothai ka siehai chu i nghatsan a, i fe a, pathien danghai rawng i bâwl a, anni chu chibai i bûk chun;"
20,"then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.","ram ka ipêk, ka rama inthawkin a zung pumin anni chu phawidawk ka ta, chun, hi in ka hminga ka lo sukthieng ta khawm hi ka hmu phâk nawah sawn hmang ka ta, hnam tin laia chun ti-elna le ṭawngnaa hmang dingin siem ka tih."
21,"And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?","Chun, hi in hieng ang lâwma insâng hi, a fekhêltuhai taphawt chun mak la tîng an ta, ‘Hi in le hi ram hi LALPA chun ieng am a law a ni ta le?’ tiin."
22,"And they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.","Chun, anni ma chun, ‘Aigupta rama inthawka anni ṭhuoi suoktu an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu an nghatsan a, pathien danghai an chel a, chibai an bûk vêl a, an rawng an bâwl a, chuleiin, hieng thil ṭha naw po po hi an chungah a hung intlungtir a nih hi,’ la tîng an tih” a ta."
