1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.","Chun, hieng thil po po hi zo a ni hnung chun, Israel chutaka umhai po po chu Juda khawpuiahai chun an feh a, lungphunhai chu an suknâwi a, Asera chu an phûrthlûk a; Benjamin le Juda ram po poa bâwl- hmunhai le mâichâmhai chu an vuok chim vawng a; Ephraim le Manasse rama khawm, a rênga an suksiet vawng hmakhat chun an thaw pei a. Chu, Israel thlahai chu, mi tin mâni hmun nei sengah, mâni khawpui sengah an kîr tah a."
2,"And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.","Hezekia chun an pâwlhai ang peiin thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu an pâwl a ruotpêk a; mi tin an sin- thaw ang peiin, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu LALPA bûk dai kawtkhâr- haia inpâk a, lâwmthu hril a, rawngbâwl a, inremna thilinhlânhai le pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu thaw dingin."
3,"He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlâna lal chan ding khawm ran a ruot a, anih, LALPA dâna ziek anga zîng- tieng le zântienga pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai le, châwlnia pumraw- hmang thilinhlânhaia le, thla tharhaia le, ruoiṭhe hunbi neihaia ding chun."
4,"Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.","Chunawa khawm, LALPA dâna an hrât theina dingin Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu an chan chu pe ve dingin Jerusalema umhai chu thu a pêk bawk a."
5,"And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.","Thupêk chu phuongdar a ni phing le chun Israel thlahai chun bu dâm, uoin dâm, khuoizu dâm le lo hmasuok po poa ra hmasatakhai chu tamtak el an hungpêk tâwl a; thil po poa sâwma pakhat khawm tamtak el an hung pêk tâwl a."
6,"And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.","Juda ram khawpuihaia um Juda le Israel thlahai chun bâwng le berâmhaia sâwma pakhat dâm, an Pathien LALPA kuoma thilinhlân sukthieng tahai dâm chu an hung chawi a, a bûm bûmin an hung sieh a."
7,"In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.","Thla thumnaa chun thil sie- khâwm chu an ṭan a, thla sarinaa chun an zo tah a."
8,"And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.","Chun, Hezekia le hotuhai chu an hung a, thil siekhâwmhai chu an hmu chun LALPA le a mi Israelhai chu an inpâk a."
9,Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.,Hezekia chun Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu thil siekhâwm chungthu chu ân dawn a.
10,"And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since the people began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Jehovah hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.","Zadok sûngkuoa mi, thiempu laltak Azaria chun a dawn a, “Mipui haiin LALPA ina an thilpêkhai an hung chawi china chun kan fâkin a huntâwk kan nei tah a; a chuong tamtak hman kan nei rau a; LALPA chun a mihai chu mal a sâwm sih a, hi siekhâwm nasatak hi kan fâk mahla chu a ni hi,” an ta."
11,Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared them;,"Chun, Hezekia chun LALPA ina chun, pindanhai buotsai dingin thu a pêk tah a; chun, an buotsai tah a."
12,"and they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully. And over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second;","Chun, thilpêkhai, sâwma pa- khat pêkhai, thilinhlânhai chu ringumtakin an hung lâk a; chu chunga chun Levi mi Konania chu a rorêltu a nih; a unaupa Simei chu a dawttu a na."
13,"and Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.","Chun, Jehiel, Azazia, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakia, Mahath le Benaia chu, Pathien in rorêltu Azaria le lal Hezekia ruotin, Konania le a unaupa Simei hnuoia enkawltuhai an nih."
14,"And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.","Chun, saktieng dâi kawtkhâr vêngtu Levi mi Imna naupa Kore chu thil inthiengtakhai le, LALPA kuoma thilpêkhai chu sem dinga, Pathien kuoma mâni nuomthua thilinhlânhai chunga hotu a nih."
15,"And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:","Ama hnuoia chun Eden, Miniamin, Jesua, Semaia, Amaria le Sekania hai, thiempuhai khawpui- haia an sin ruotahai chun, an unau- hai chu, a chîn le lien kuoma an chan chit chu sem dingin an um bawk a;"
16,"besides them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their courses;","pasal tienga inthla dâna suiin, kum thuma upa chin chung tienga mi, LALPA ina lût taphawt elhai kha, an pâwl ang peia an rawngbâwlnaa an sin chan an ni tin chan ang pei a fe hlakhai tiem loin;"
17,"and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their courses;","Levi mihai le an pahnam ang pei a, thiempuhai inthla sâwng dâna kum sâwmhni le a chungtieng mi po po an pâwla an chan ang chun an ruot a;"
18,"and them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.","chun, thiempuhai chu, an nau le têhai inthla sâwng dânah, an nu- hmeihai, an naupasalhai, an naunu- hmeihai mipui laia po po chun, an rawngbâwlna dinga ruot senga chun inthiengna dingin an inhlânthieng tâwl a;"
19,"Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.","thiempu Aron naupasalhai an khawpuihai khaw hmawr phûla umhai khawm chun, khawpui tamtak elahai chun, Levi mihai laia inthla dâna tiem sa po pohai le thiempuhai laia pasal po pohai kuoma an chanhai sempêk dingin, an hming suota ruot an um bawk a."
20,And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.,"Chuong ang tak chun lal Hezekia chun Juda ram sûng po poa chun a thaw suok vawng a; a Pathien LALPA hmaa ringumna le, thil indik le thil ṭha chu a thaw tah a."
21,"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.","Chun, LALPA ina rawngbâwlna sin a thaw tinrênga le, dâna le, thu- pêkahai chun, a Pathien chu zawng dingin lungril po poin a thaw hlak a; a hlawtling ngei a."
