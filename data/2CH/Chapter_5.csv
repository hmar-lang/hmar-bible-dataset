1,"Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.","Chuongchun, LALPA in dinga Solomonin sin a thaw po po chu zo a ni tah a. Chun, Solomon chun a pa Davidin thil a lo hlân tah tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, bûr le bêl po pohai chu a hung lâk lût a, Pathien in ro siekhâwmna hmuna chun a sie tah a."
2,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ houses of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.","Chun, Solomon chun David khawpui Ziona LALPA thuthlungna bâwm chu hung la dingin, Israel thlahai pahnamhai laia ṭhuoituhai, hnam tin laia luhai le, Israel upahai chu Jerusalema chun a ko khâwm tâwl tah a."
3,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month.",Israel mihai po po chu thla sarinaa ruoiṭhenaa chun lal kuoma chun an hung khâwm vawng a.
4,And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;,"Israel upahai po po chu an hung a, Levi mihai chun bâwm chu an zâwn tah a."
5,"and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.","Chun, bâwm le, intuokna puon in le puon ina bûr le bêl inthienghai po po le chun an zu lâk tah a; hieng thilhai hi thiempu Levi mihai chun an zu lâk a nih."
6,"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.","Lal Solomon le Israel mipui ama hmaa hung inkhâwmhai po po chun berâm le bâwngchal a tam tienga tiem sênglo le hril thei lo chun inthâwiin, bâwm hmaa chun an um a."
7,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.","Chun, thiempuhai chun LALPA thuthlungna bâwm chu, chu in hmun inthieng, hmun inthiengtaka cherub- hai thla zar hnuoia a hmun dinga chun an hung lâklût tah a."
8,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.","Cherubhai chun an thlahai chun bâwm umna hmun chu an zârkhum a, cherubhai chun bâwm le chutaka a zâwnfunghai chu an inkhum sa sih a."
9,And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is unto this day.,"Chun, a zâwnfunghai chu an sei êm a, zâwnfung hmawrhai chu hmun inthieng hmaa inthawkin ân hmu thei a; amiruokchu, puotienga in- thawk chun ân hmu thei nawh a; chutaka chun tu chen hin a um tah a."
10,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.","Chu bâwm sûnga chun, Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok laia Israel thlahai kuoma LALPAIN thu- thlung a siem laia Mosien Horeba lungphêk pahni a sie lût chau naw kha chu ieng dang khawm a um nawh a."
11,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;","Chun, thiempuhai chu hmun inthienga inthawka an hung suok chun, (thiempu chutaka um po pohai chu an pâwl hunbi nghâk kher loin sukthieng an ni hlak sih a;"
12,"also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets);","Levi mi chutaka hla saktuhai khawm chu an rêngin, Asaph hai, Heman hai, Jeduthun hai, an naupasalhai le an unauhai leh puon zai inhmi puona inthuomin, per- khuong leh, ṭingṭang leh dârben- thekhai leh mâichâm tâwp saktieng panga chun an ngîr a; anni lai chun thiempu za le sâwmhni tawtawrâwt mûttuhai an um bawk a):"
13,"it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, saying, For he is good; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,","LALPA inpâka, lâwmthu hrila, hla saktuhai le tawtawrâwt puhai chu pakhat ang el a, ri inremtaka hriet a ni hlak a; tawtawrâwthai le, dârbenthekhai le, rimawi thawna thuomhnawhai leh an râwlhai an insuo a, LALPA chu inpâka, “Ama chu a ṭha sih a; a zângaina chu kum- khuoin um zing a tih,” an ti pha chun, LALPA in chu sûmin a hung sip hlak a,"
14,so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.,"chuongchun, thiempuhai chu sûm lei chun rawngbâwl dingin an ngîr zing thei ta ngai nawh a, LALPA ropuina chun Pathien in chu a hung suksip hlak leiin."
