1,And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:,"Chun, Oded naupa Azaria chunga chun Pathien thlarau a hung a;"
2,"and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.","Asa chu tuok dingin a va fe suok a, a kuoma chun, “Nangni Asa le Benjamin le Juda ram po pohai, mi lo ngai ta u; a kuoma in um sûng po chun LALPA chu in kuomah a um a; chun, ama chu in zawng chun in ihmuin um a ta; amiruokchu, ama chu in nghatsan chun nghatsan vêng a ti cheu."
3,"Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:","Chuongchun, hun sâwttak el chu Israel ram chu Pathien indiktak bo, inchûktirtu thiempu le dân boin an lo um tah a;"
4,"but when in their distress they turned unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.","amiruokchu, an rimsiknaa chun Israel Pathien LALPA kuom tieng chun an kîr nâwk a, ama chu an zawng a, an hmu a ni kha."
5,"And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.","Chuong lai hunahai chun mi hung lût ta ding le a suok ta ding khawm chun muongna hrim hrim a um nawh a, ram po pohai hluotuhai chunga chun lunginzîngna nasatak a um lem a."
6,"And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.","A tum tumin an insukdar vawng a, hnam chungah hnam dang, khaw- pui chungah khawpui dang; inhmêl- mâkna tinrêngin Pathienin anni chu a suklungsen tâwl sih a."
7,"But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.","Amiruokchu, insukhrât unla; in- thlada naw ro, in sinthaw chu lâwmman pêk in ni ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
8,"And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.","Asa chun hieng thu le, zâwlnei Oded thuhrilhai chu a hriet chun, ân sukhuoi a, Juda le Benjamin ram po poa le Ephraim tlâng rama khawpui a lâkhaia inthawka tirdakumnahai po po chu a sie hmang tah a; LALPA mâichâm LALPA tuolpûk hmaa um chu a siem thar bawk a."
9,"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.","Juda le Benjamin rama mi po po le, Ephraim le Manasse le Simeona inthawka chutaka hung inpêm lûthai chu a ko khâwm vawng a; LALPA a Pathien chu a kuomah a um ti an hmu chun Israel rama inthawkin mi tamtak chu ama kuoma chun an lo kai ta sih a."
10,"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.","Chuongchun, anni chu Asa rorêl kum sâwmpanga kum thla thumnaa chun Jerusalema chun an hung inkhâwm tâwl a."
11,"And they sacrificed unto Jehovah in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.","Chu ni chun râllâk thila an hung lâk, bâwngchal za sari le berâm sâng sariin LALPA kuomah an inthâwi a."
12,"And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;","Chun, an lungvar po po le an lungril po po an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu zawng dingin thuthlung an siem a."
13,"and that whosoever would not seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.","chuongchun, mi tukhawm Israel Pathien LALPA zawng lo chu mi lien amanih, mi chîn amanih, pasal amanih nuhmei amani khawm ni sienla sukhlum ding a nih."
14,"And they sware unto Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.","Chun, rawsemhai, tawtawrâwt- hai le khêkriin, râwl inringtakin LALPA kuoma chun ṭawng an inkhâm a."
15,"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Jehovah gave them rest round about.","Juda mihai po po chu thutiem chun an hlim hle a, an lungril po poin an inkhâm a, an châkna po poa ama chu an zawng leiin, ama chu an ihmua chun a um hrim a; chuong- chun, a vêlin anni chu LALPA chun muongna a pêk tah a."
16,"And also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.","Lal Asa chun a nu Maaka khawm chu Asera ta dingin lim tirdakum chu a siem leiin lalnu a ninaa inthawk chun a bân bawk a; chun, Asa chun a milim chu a phûr thlûk a, a suknâwi vawng a, Kidron vadungtêa chun a raw tah a."
17,But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.,"Nisienlakhawm, Israel rama inthawk chun bâwlhmunhai chu lâk hmang a ni nawh a, amiruokchu, a dam sûng po po Asa lungril chu ngiltakin a um a."
18,"And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.","A pain a lo inhlân tahai le amain ân hlân tahai, tangkaruo dâm, râng- kachak dâm, bûr le bêlhai leh Pathien ina chun a hung lâk a."
19,And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.,Asa rorêl a kum sâwmthum pangana chen chun indona hrim hrim a um ta nawh a.
