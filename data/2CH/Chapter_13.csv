1,In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.,Jeroboam inlal kum sâwm- parietnaa chun Abija chun Juda rama chun ro a rêl ṭan a.
2,Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.,"Ama chun kum thum lai Jerusalemah ro a rêl a; a nu hming chu Mikaia, Gibea mi, Uriel naunu kha a nih. Chun, Jeroboam le Abija inkâra khawm chun indona a um a."
3,"And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.",Abija chun indonaa mi hrât ruol sipai pâwl thlang ṭhieu nuoi li lai chun indonaa chun a hang thaw a; Jeroboam khawm chun mi hrât khawkhêng thlang ṭhieu nuoi riet leh indonaa chun ama chu a hung ep ve bawk a.
4,"And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:","Abija chu Ephraim tlâng rama Zemaraim tlâng chunga chun a ngîr a. “Aw Jeroboam le Israel mi po pohai, mi lo ngai ta u;"
5,"Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?","LALPA Israelhai Pathienin David le a thlahai kuomah Israel ram chu kumkhuoa dingin machi thuthlung hmangin a pêk a nih, ti in hriet naw am a ni?"
6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.","David naupa Solomon siehlaw, Nebat naupa Jeroboam hi thoin, a pu chungah a lo hel el hi."
7,"And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.","Chun, ama kuoma chun mi teplohai, mi hmangna bohai chu an inkhâwm a, Rehoboam chu a la nau- panga, lungril dâwng a ni lai khan, anni chu Solomon naupa Rehoboam kalin an insukhrât a, ama chun a lo dang zo ta naw kha a na."
8,"And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.","Chun, tuhin David naupasalhai kuta LALPA ram chu do thei dingin in inngaituoh a, mipui nasatak in na, in kuoma chun in pathienhai dinga Jeroboamin a siem rângkachak bâwngtehai chu an um bawk a."
9,"Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.","LALPA thiempuhai Aron nau- pasalhai le Levi mihai chu in hnawtsuokin, ram dang mihai dân angin thiempuhai in insiem fâwm a ni naw am a nih? chuleichun, mi tukhawm berâm pasari le bâwngchal tuoia ama inpumpêk dinga hung taphawt chu pathien ni lohai thiempuhai chu an ni thei pei a."
10,"But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and we have priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:","Amiruokchu, keini chu LALPA chu kan Pathien a na, ama chu kan nghatsan nawh a; LALPA ta dinga rawngbâwltu thiempu kan neihai chu Aron naupasalhai an na, Levi chihaiin an ṭhangpui a;"
11,"and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.","riminhnik thilinhlânhai le pum- rawhmang thilinhlânhai chu zîng tin le zân tin LALPA kuoma chun an rawh a; entirna bei khawm chu dawkân inthieng chunga chun indawt thliein an sieh a; chun, rângkachak sathâu khâwnvar siena khawm, chutaka a khâwnvarhai zân tina sit ding leh; LALPA kan Pathien thupêk ang chu kan kawl zing a; amiruokchu, nangni chun in nghatsan a ni hi."
12,"And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.","Chun, en ta u, Pathien chu kan hma tieng keini lai a um a; in chunga inlâuna sukri dingin suklauna taw- tawrâwthai le thiempuhai chu an um bawk a; Aw Israel thlahai, in thla- tuhai Pathien LALPA chu do naw ro khai; in hlawtling naw ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
13,"But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.","Nisienlakhawm, Jeroboam chun an hnung tienga hung dingin lambun pâwl a siem a; chuongchun, Juda hmaa chun an um a, lambun pâwl chu an hnunga chun an um bawk a."
14,"And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.","Chun, Juda mihai chu an hei nghakîr chun, ngai ta, râl chu an hma le hnunga chun an um tah a; LALPA chu an ko a, thiempuhai chun taw- tawrâwthai chu an mût tah a."
15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.","Chun, Juda mihai chu an khêk a; chuonga Juda mihai an khêk chun, Pathienin Israelhai po po le Jeroboam chu Abija le Juda mihai hmaa chun a hung suktlâwm tah a."
16,And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.,"Chuongchun, Juda mihai hmaa inthawk chun Israel mihai chu an tlânseh a; chun, Pathienin an kuta chun anni chu a pêk tah a."
17,And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.,"Abija le a mihai chun nasatakin anni chu an that tah a, chuongchun, thlang ṭhieu Israel mi nuoi nga chu thatin an tlu tah a."
18,"Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Chuongchun, chu huna chun Israel thlahai chu sukhnuoiin an um tah a, Juda thlahai ruok chun an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu an ringsan leiin an hne tah a."
19,"And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.","Abija chun Jeroboam chu a hnawt pei a, amaa inthawk chun khawpuihai a lâk a; Bethel le chutaka a khawperhai leh, Jesana le chutaka a khawperhai leh, Ephron le chutaka a khawperhai leh."
20,"Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.","Abija dam sûng chun Jeroboam chu a hrât suok nâwk ta ngai nawh a; LALPA chun a hrem a, ama chu a thi tah a."
21,"But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.","Chun, Abija chun thil a hung thawthei deu deu a, nuhmei sâwm pali a nei a, naupasal sâwmhni pahni le naunuhmei sâwmparuk a nei a."
22,"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.","Abija thilthaw danghai, a thaw- dânhai le a thuhrilhai chu zâwl- nei Iddo hrilfiena bua chun ziek an nih."
