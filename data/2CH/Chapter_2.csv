1,"Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.","Chun, Solomon chun LALPA hmingin in le, ama lalram ta dingin in bâwl a lo tum tah a."
2,"And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.","Chuongchun, Solomon chun phurrik phur mi sîng sari le thing sak mi sîng riet le, anni chu enkawltu dingin mi sâng thum le za ruk chu a ruot tah a."
3,"And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.","Chun, Solomon chun Tura lal Huram kuoma chun mi a tir a, “Ka pa David kha i lo ngaisak a, a umna dinga in bâwlna dingin sidar thinghai i lo thawn ang bawk khan, kei khawm mi hung thawn ve rawh."
4,"Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.","Ngai ta, LALPA ka Pathien hmingin ama kuoma inhlân ding le, riminhnikhai a hmaa râwna ding le, entirna bei sie zingna ding le, zîng le zâna le, châwlnia le, thla tharhaia le, LALPA kan Pathien ruoiṭhe hun- bihaia pumrawhmang thilinhlânna dingin in ka bâwl a. Hi hi Israel kuoma kumkhaw thuthlung a ni hrim a."
5,And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.,"Chu in ka bâwl chu a ropui hle a, kan Pathien chu pathien danghai po po nêkin a ropui lem hrim a."
6,"But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?","Amiruokchu, vân le vânhai vân khawm chun ama chu a dâwl nawh ti hmuin tuin am ama ta ding chun in bâwl thei a ta? Ama hmaa riminhnik rawna ding ti chau naw chu, ama ta dingin in ka hang bâwlpêk chu, a tu ang am ka ni hrim a?"
7,"Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that knoweth how to grave all manner of gravings, to be with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.","Chuleiin, tuhin rângkachak sina themthiem mi, tangkaruo le, dârsen le thîra thiem, a senêm le a senduk le, a dumpâwla thiem, ker dân kawng chi tinrênga thiem, ka pa Davidin a lo ruoi tah, Jerusalem le Juda rama mi thiemhai le thaw ding hin mi them- thiem mi hungtir pêk rawh."
8,"Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,","Sidar thinghai, fâr thinghai, al- gum thinghai Lebanona inthawk khan mi hung inphur bawk la; i mihai chu Lebanona thingphûr an thiem ti ka hriet si a; chun, ngai ta, i sie- hlawhai chu ka siehlawhai leh um an ta;"
9,even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.,"thing tamtak el mi buotsaipêk dingin, hi in ka bâwl ding hi nasataka ropui a ni ding a ni sih a."
10,"And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.","Chun, i mi thing âttuhai kuoma chun bupui tekhâwng sîng hni le, buṭei tekhâwng sîng hni le, hriek bath sîng hni le uoin bath sîng hni pêng ka tih,” tiin."
11,"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them.","Tura lal Huram chun ziekin a dawn a, chu chu Solomon kuomah a thawn a, “LALPA chun a mihai a lunginsiet leiin an chunga lalah a siem che a nih,” tiin."
12,"Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.","Huram bawk chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien, hnuoi le vân siem- tu lal David kuoma naupasal vartak hrietthiemna le thlierthiemna nei mi, LALPA ta ding le a lal ram ta dinga in bâwltu ding petu chu inpâkin um raw se."
13,"And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,","Chun, tuhin hi mi themthiem, hrietthiemna nei mi, a hming Huramabi ka hung tir,"
14,"the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed unto him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father.","ama chu Dan naunuhmeihai thlaa mi a na, ama pa chu Tura mi hrim, rângkachak sina le tangkaruoa le, dârsena le thîra le lunga le, thinga le, a senêma le, a dumpâwla le, puon zai inhmia le a senduka thiem a na, ker dân chi tinrênga ker ding le, thaw dân kawng ruot ang thaw ding mi thiem a na; i themthiemhai le ka pu David i pa, mi thiemhai leh ama chun sin thâwng a ta."
15,"Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:","Tuhin bupui le buṭei le hriek le, uoin ka puin a hril ta kha, a siehlawhai kuoma hin hung thawn sienla,"
16,"and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.","pawimaw ding ang zât zât chu Lebanona inthawkin thing chu hung sât kan ta, tuipuiah Joppa chen hung tawl kan ta, chutaka inthawk chun Jerusalemah nangin lâng i ta,” tiin."
17,"And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.","Chun, Solomon chun Israel rama mikhuol um po pohai chu a tiem a, a pa Davidin a tiem hnunghai kha, chuongchun, nuoi khat sîng nga sâng thum le za ruk an tling a."
18,"And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work.","Chun, anni laia sîng sari chu thil phur mi dingin a ruot a; chun, sîng riet chu tlânga thing sak mi dingin; chun, sâng thum le za ruk chu mipuihai sin inthawtirtu dingin."
