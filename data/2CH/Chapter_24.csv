1,"Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beer-sheba.","Joas chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sari mi chau a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmli sûng ro a rêl a; a nu chu Beer-sebaa mi, a hming Zibia a nih."
2,And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.,Thiempu Jehoiada dam sûng po poa chun Joas chun Pathien mit- hmuah thil indikhai chu a thaw a.
3,And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.,Jehoiada chun nuhmei pahni ân neitir a; naupasalhai le naunu- hmeihai a nei a.
4,"And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah.",Joas chun LALPA in chu siem ṭhat a lungril tah a.
5,"And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.","Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, “Juda ram khawpuiahai chun fe suok unla, kum tinin in Pathien in siem ṭhatna dingin Israel mihai po poa inthawk chun tangka dâwl unla; hi thil hi hung inhmaw hle dingin ngaituo ro,” a ta. Amiruokchu, Levi mihai chu an inhmaw naw hle el a."
6,"And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?","Chun, lal chun thiempu laltak Jehoiada chu a ko a, a kuomah, “Thuthlungna puon ina dingin, Israel mipuihai le LALPA siehlaw Mosie ruot leiman chu Jerusalem le Juda rama inthawka hung la dingin ieng dinga Levi mihai hi i tir naw am a na?"
7,"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah did they bestow upon the Baalim.","Kha nuhmei rilo Athalia naupa- salhai khan Pathien in chu an lo suksiet a; LALPA in ta dinga thilin- hlânhai po po kha Baal kuomah an lo pêk vawng ta sih a,” a ta."
8,"So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, lal chun thu a pêk a, thingrem an siem a, LALPA in dâi kawtkhâr puoa chun an in- ṭhut a."
9,"And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Jehovah the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.","Chun, Jerusalema le Juda ram po poa chun, thlalêra Pathien siehlaw Mosien Israel mihai po po chunga thawbi a lo siem ta chu LALPA ta dinga hung chawi dingin thuphuong- na an siem tah a."
10,"And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.","Chuongchun, lalhai po po le mipuihai po po chu an hlim hle a, an tangkahai an hung chawi a, thing- rema chun an dâwl zo hmakhat chun an thlâk ta zing hlak a."
11,"And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.","Chun, thingrem chu lal hotuhai hmaa Levi mihai chun an hung lâk po leh, tangka tamtak a um ti an hmu chun lal lekhaziektu le thiempu laltak hotu chu an hung a, thingrem chu an sukruok a, an lâk a, a hmuna bawk chun an va sie nâwk hlak a, chuong ang chun ni tin an thaw a, tangka tamtak an inkhâwl a."
12,"And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.","Chun, chu chu LALPA in rawng- bâwlna sin thaw ang pei chun Jehoiada le lal chun an pêk suok tah a; in bâwlthiemhai le, thing sak- thiemhai LALPA in siem ṭha ding chun an ruoi a, LALPA in bâwl ṭha dinga dârsen le thîra sinthawtuhai khawm chu."
13,"So the workmen wrought, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.","Chuongchun, sinthawtuhai chun sin an thawh a; sin chu anni thaw zo famkim a ni tah a, Pathien in chu a ngai ang bawk chun an bâwl ṭhah a, an sukdet tah a."
14,"And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels wherewith to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.","Chun, an zo pha chun, tangka danghai chu lal le Jehoiada kuoma chun an hung chawi a; chuonghai chun LALPA ina bûr le bêlhai, rawng- bâwlna le inhlânna bûr le bêlhai, haihawhai, rângkachak le tangkaraw bûr le bêlhai chu siem a na. Chun, Jehoiada dam sûng po po chun ni tin hin LALPA ina chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu an inhlân zing zing hlak a."
15,"But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.","Nisienlakhawm, Jehoiada chu a hung upa a, a hung tar tah a, a thi tah a; a thi chun kum za le sâwmthum mi a nih."
16,"And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.","Ama chu David khawpuiah lalhai laia chun an phûm a, Pathien le a in chunga le, Israel ram sûnga chun thil ṭha a thaw hlak leiin."
17,"Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.","Jehoiada a thi hnung chun Juda ram lalhai chu an hung a, lal kuoma chun devânkaina an hung siem a. Chun, lal khawm chun an thu chu a lo ngai a."
18,"And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.","An thlatuhai Pathien LALPA in chu an nghatsan a; milimhai le Asera rawng chu an bâwl tah a; chuong- chun, hi an rîtlona lei hin Jerusalem le Juda ram chunga chun lungsenna a hung tlung tah a."
19,"Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto Jehovah; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.","LALPA kuoma hung ṭhuoi nâwk dingin an kuoma chun zâwlneihai a tir a; anni chu an lo ngâwk a, na an lo daw nuom nawh a."
20,"And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken Jehovah, he hath also forsaken you.","Chun, thiempu Jehoiada naupa Zekaria kuoma chun Pathien thlarau a hung tlung a, mipuihai chunga chun a ngîr a, an kuomah, “Pathien chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Hlawtling thei nâwna pha el dinga iengdinga LALPA thupêkhai chu in bawsiet am a na? LALPA chu in nghatsan leiin ama khawma a nghatsan cheu a ni hi,’ tiin,” a ta."
21,"And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.","Chun, ama chu an phierrûk tah a, LALPA in inhuon tuolsûnga chun lal thupêkin an dêng hlum tah a."
22,"Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah look upon it, and require it.","Chuongchun, lal Joas chun ama chunga a pa Jehoiada ngilneizie kha a hriet zing ta nawh a, a naupa chu a that tah a. Chun, a thi chun, “LALPAIN hung en sienla, phuba la raw se,” a ta."
23,"And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.","Chun, kum tâwpa chun Suria sipaihai chun ama chu an hung rûn tah a; chuongchun, Juda ram le Jeru- salema khawm chun an hung lût a; an mi lienhai po po chu an sukbohmang vawng a, annia râllâk sum po po chu Damaska lal kuomah an inphur vawng a."
24,"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.","Suria sipai pâwlhai chu mi tlâwmte chau hi an hung a, ami- ruokchu, LALPA chun sipai pâwl lientak chu an kutah a pêk sih a; an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu an nghatsan leiin. Chuongchun, Joas chunga chun hremna chu an in- tlungtir tah a."
25,"And when they were departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.","Chun, ama chu an mâksan chun (na inrimtakin ama chu an mâksan sih a), thiempu Jehoiada naupasalhai thisen lei khan ama siehlaw ngeiin ama chu a phierrûk tah a; a khum chunga ngei chun a that a, a thi tah a; David khawpuia chun an phûm a, nisienlakhawm, lalhai thlân ina khan chu an phûm nawh."
26,"And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.","Hienghai hi ama phierrutuhai chu an nih: Ammon nu Simeath naupa Zabad hai, Moab nu Simrith naupa Jehozabad hai hi."
27,"Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, a naupasalhai chungthu le, ama chunga phurrik nasatak innghat le, Pathien in bâwl thu chu, ngai ta, lalhai chanchin ziekna bua chun an ziek a. Chun, a naupa Amazia chun ama aiin ro a rêl tah a."
