1,And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.,"Jerusalema chênghai chun a naupa naupang tak Ahazia chu ama aia chun lalin an siem a; Arabia mihai le pâwl ruol bûka hunghai khan a upahai po chu an that vawng ta sih a. Chuongchun, Judai ram lal Jehoram naupa Ahazia chun ro a rêl tah a."
2,Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.,"Ro a rêl ṭan chun Ahazia chu kum sâwmli pahni mi a na, Jerusalema chun kum khat sûng ro a rêl a, a nu hming chu Athalia, Omri naunu a nih."
3,He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.,Ama khawma Ahab sûngkaw lampuihai kha a hraw ve a; a nu chu khawhlotaka khawsa dinga a thu rawtpuitu a ni sih a.
4,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.",Ahab sûngkuoin an thaw ang khan LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw chu a thaw a; a pa a thi hnung chun anni chu a sietna ding chena a thu rawtpuituhai an ni sih a.
5,"He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.","An thu rawt ang pei chun a fe a, Suria ram lal Hazael chu do dingin Ramoth-gileada chun Israel ram lal Ahab naupa Jehoram le chun a hang fe veh a; Suria mihai chun Joram chu an lo inhliem a."
6,"And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.","Chun, Suria ram lal Hazael a donaa Ramaa ama an inhliemnahai chu insukdam dingin Jezreela chun a kîr tah a. Chun, Judai ram lal Jeho- ram naupa Azaria chu, Ahab naupa Jehoram chu a damnaw leia Jezreela en dingin a zu feh a."
7,"Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.","Chuongchun, Ahazia bohmangna chu Pathiena inthawk a na, Joram kuoma a hang fe lei tak chu a nih; chuonga a hung lai chun, Ahab sûng- kuo chu sât thlatu dinga LALPAIN hriek a lo nâl tah Nimsi naupa Jehu chu do dingin Joram le khan a hang fe ve sih a."
8,"And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them.","Chun, Jehu chun thupêk Ahab sûngkaw ta dinga a pêk suok lai chun Juda ram lalhai le Ahazia unauhai naupasalhai chu Ahazia rawngbâwl- in a hmuh a, anni chu a that tâwl tah a."
9,"And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.","Chun, Ahazia chu a zawng a, an man a, (Samariaa chun a lo in bihmang a na) Jehu kuoma chun an hung ṭhuoi a, an that tah a; chun, an phûm a, “A lungril po poa LALPA zawngtu Jehosaphat naupa chu a ni ngei,” an tih a. Chuongchun, Ahazia sûngkuoa chun lalram chunga rorêl thei ding mi pakhat khawm an um ta nawh a."
10,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.","Chun, Ahazia nu Athalia chun a naupa chu a thi tah ti a hriet chun, a tho a, Juda sûngkuo lal chi po chu a rawt ta vawng a."
11,"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.","Amiruokchu, lal naunu Jehosa- beath chun Ahazia naupa Joas chu a lâk a, lal nauhai thata umhai laia inthawk chun ân rûkhmang a, khum pindanah ama dawntu le chun a sie tah a. Chuongchun, lal Jehoram nau- nu Jehosabeath, thiempu Jehoiada nuhmei chun (ama chu Ahazia farnu a ni sih a,) Athaliaa inthawk chun a thuphmang a, chuongchun, a suk- hlum ve nawh a."
12,And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.,"Pathien ina chun anni leh kum ruk sûng thupin a um a, chun, Athalia chun ram chunga chun ro a rêl a."
