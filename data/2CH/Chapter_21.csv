1,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.",Jehosaphat chu a thlatuhai kuoma chun a in tah a; David khawpuiah a thlatuhai kuoma chun phûmin a um tah a; a naupa Jehoram chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a;
2,"And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.","chun, unauhai, Jehosaphat nau- pasalhai a nei a: Azaria, Jehiel, Zekaria, Azaria, Mikael, Sephatia; hienghai po po hi Israel ram lal Jehosaphat naupasalhai an nih."
3,"And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born.","Chun, an pa chun an kuoma chun thilpêk nasatak elhai, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, thil hlutakhai dâm le Juda rama khawpui kul nei- hai leh a pêk a; amiruokchu, Jehoram chu nau lutîr a ni leiin lalram chu a pêk a."
4,"Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.","Chuonga Jehoram chu a pa ram chunga chun a hung inlal a, a hung insukhrât phing chun a unauhai po po le Israel rama lal tamtak chu kâwlhnâmin a that tâwl tah a."
5,Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.,Rorêl a ṭan chun Jehoram chu kum sâwmthum pahni a na; Jerusa- lema chun kum riet sûng ro a rêl a.
6,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.","Ama chun Ahab sûngkuoin an thaw ang khan, Israel ram lalhai lampuia bawk khan a feh a; Ahab naunu nuhmeiah a nei a; LALPA mithmua thil ṭha lo chu a thawh a."
7,"Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun David sûngkuo chu a sukbohmang nawh a, David kuoma thuthlung a lo siem ta lei le, ama le a thlahai kuoma khâwnvar pêk zing zing dinga a lo tiem ta leiin."
8,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.","Ama hun laia chun Edom ram chu Judahai chunga chun an hel a, anni chunga chun lal an siem tah a."
9,"Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots.","Chun, Jehoram chu ama le a sakawr tawlailîr po pohai le a hotuhai le chun ân thawk a, zân lai a hang ṭhâwng a, sakawr tawlailîr hotuhai le ama inhuoltu Edom mihai chu a thaw tah a."
10,"So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.","Chuongchun, vawisûn ni chen hin Edom mihai chu Judahai chunga chun an hel ta zing a; chu huna bawk chun Libna khuo khawm chu an lo hel veh a; a thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu a lo nghatsan tâk leiin."
11,"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray.","Chunawa khawm chun Juda ram tlângahai chun bâwlhmunhai a siem a, Jerusalema umhai chu ân uirettir a, chuongchun, Juda ram chu an lo ṭhuoi hmang tah a."
12,"And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,","Chun, a kuoma chun zâwlnei Elija kuoma inthawkin lekha ziek a hung a, “I pu David Pathien LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ‘I pa Jehosaphat lampuihai chu i hraw nawh a, Juda ram lal Asa lampuihai khawm chu i hraw bawk nawh a;"
13,"but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like as the house of Ahab did, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, who were better than thyself:","Israel lalhai lampuihai chu i hraw lem a. Ahab sûngkuoin an lo thaw ta angin, Jerusalema umhai le Juda rama mihai chu i lo inuirettir tah a; chun, i pahnama mi i unauhai nanga nêka ṭha lemhai chu i that bawk a,"
14,"behold, Jehovah will smite with a great plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance;","ngai ta, LALPA chun i mihai, i nauhai, i nuhmeihai le i thilnei po pohai chu hripuiin nasatakin a hrem ding a nih;"
15,"and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.","i phîng natna leiin nang khawma natna nasatak nei i ta; ni tin tinin, chu natna leia i rîlhai a suok zo vawng hmakhat chun nei i tih,’” tiin."
16,"And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the Ethiopians:","Chun, Ethiopia mihai kâwla um Arabia le Philistin mihai lungril chu Jehoram chunga chun LALPAIN a chawktho a;"
17,"and they came up against Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.","Juda ram chu an hung rûn a, an hung lût a; lal ina thil hmua umhai po po an lâk vawng a; a naupasalhai le naunuhmeihai leh, chuongchun, a naupasalhai laia a naupang tak Jehoahaz ti chau naw chu a naupa- sal hrim hrim mâksanpêk a ni nawh a."
18,And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.,"chun, hieng thilhai po po hnunga hin LALPA chun a phîngah natna dam thei loin a hrem a."
19,"And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.","Chuong anga kum hni ân vawi hnung chun, a natna lei chun a rîl chu a suok a, natna natakin a thi tah a. Chun, a mihai chun a thlatuhai chawimawinaa meipui an sêm ang khan, ama ta dingin meichawk an siempêk nawh a."
20,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.","Rorêl a ṭan chun kum sâwm- thum pahni mi a na, Jerusalema chun kum riet ro a rêl a; ama chu ngainatna um loin a thi tah a; David khawpuia chun an phûm a, lalhai thlân ina khan ni loin."
