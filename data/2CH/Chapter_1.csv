1,"And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.","Chun, David naupa Solomon chu a rama chun sukdet a ni tah a, LALPA a Pathien chu a kuomah a um a, ama chu nasatakin a chawimawi a."
2,"And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ houses.","Solomon chun, Israel mi po pohai le, sipai za khat pâwl le sâng khat pâwl hotuhai kuoma le, rorêltuhai kuoma le, Israel rama lalhai po po kuoma le, pahnam luhai kuoma chun thu a hril a."
3,"So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.","Chuongchun, Solomon le a kuoma mipui inkhâwmhai po po chu Gibeona bâwlhmuna chun an hang fe tah a; LALPA siehlaw Mosien thla- lêra Pathien ta dinga intuokna in a siem chu chutaka chun a um sih a."
4,But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathien bâwm chu David chun Kiriath-jearima in- thawk khan a hung lâk a, Davidin a siena dinga a buotsai hmuna khan a lo sie tah a; Jerusalema khan, chu hmun ding chun puon in a lo zâr ta sih a."
5,"Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it.","Chunawa khawm, dârsen mâi- châm Hur naupa, Uri naupa Bezalel- in a lo siem ta chu LALPA biekbûk hmaa chun a um bawk a; Solomon le mipui chun an va pan a."
6,"And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.","Chun, Solomon chu LALPA hmaa dârsen mâichâm intuokna ina uma chun a hang feh a, a chunga chun pumrawhmang thilinhlân sâng khat lai ân hlân a."
7,"In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.","Chu zân chun Solomon kuomah LALPA chu a hung inlâr a, a kuomah, “Ieng am a na ka pêk ding che, mi hni rawh,” a ta."
8,"And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.","Solomon chun Pathien kuoma chun, “Ka pa David kuoma chun lung- insietna nasatak i lo inentir tah a, ama aia chun tuhin lalah i mi siem tah a."
9,"Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.","Tuhin, Aw LALPA Pathien, ka pa David kuoma i thutiem chu suk- puitling ni raw se; tam tienga hnuoia pilvut zât rau ang mipui chunga hin lalah i mi siem ta sih a."
10,"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?","Hi mipuihai hmaa hin ka lûta ka suok theina dingin tuhin varna le hrietthiem theina nangin mi pe la; chuong naw chun, hi i mihai hieng zât lâwm lâwm hi tuin am ro rêlpêk thei an ta?” a ta."
11,"And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:","Pathien chun Solomon kuomah, “Hi hi i lungrilah a um a, hausak- nahai, neinungnahai le inzaumnahai amanih, nangma theidatuhai che hringna amanih, i hni nawh a, dam sâwtna khawm i hni bawk nawh a, amiruokchu, ka mihai, an chunga lala ka siemnahai che chu ro i rêl- pêk theina dinga nangma ta dinga varna le hrietthiem theina i hni lem leiin;"
12,"wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there any after thee have the like.","varna le hrietthiem theina chu i kuoma pêk a ni tah a; i hmaa lalhai tukhawma an nei dêr lo le, nangma hnunga tukhawma chuong anga an nei dêr lo ding hausaknahai le, nei- nungnahai le, inzâkaina pêng ka ti che,” a ta."
13,"So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.","Chuongchun, Solomon chu a vân zinna Gibeona bâwlhmun, in- tuokna puon in hmaa inthawk chun Jerusalema chun a hung tah a; chuongchun, Israel chunga chun ro a rêl tah a."
14,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.","Chun, Solomon chun sakawr tawlailîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai chu a kei khâwm a, sakawr tawlailîr sâng khat le za li le, sakawr chung chuong mi sîng khat le sâng hni a nei a; chuong chu sakawr tawlailîr khawpuiahai le lal kuomah Jerusalema chun a sieh a."
15,"And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.","Chun, lal chun tangka le râng- kachak chu Jerusalema chun lung ang el le, Sidar thing chu phai rama theichang kûng ang ela tama intiengin a sieh a."
16,"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.","Chun, Solomonin sakawr a neihai chu Aigupta rama inthawka inchâwk suok vawng an nih; lal sumdâwng mihai chun a ruol ruolin an lo khâr hlak a, a ruola inchâwk pei a nih;"
17,"And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.","chuongchun, an hung lâk a, Aiguptaa inthawkin sakawr tawlailîr chu tangkaruo shekel za ruk peiin an intlungtir bawk a; chun, sakawrhai chu Hit mi lalhai le Suria lalhai ta ding khawmin an suktlungpêk hlak a; sakawrhai chu tangkaruo shekel za le sâwmnga peiin an intlungtir a nih."
