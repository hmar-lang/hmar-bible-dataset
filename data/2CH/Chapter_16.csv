1,"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.","Asa rorêl a kum sâwmthum paruk kum chun, Israel ram lal Baasa chun Juda ram a hang rûn a, Juda ram lal Asa kuoma mi a hung amanih, a suok amanih a phal naw- na dingin Rama khuo chu a siem tah a."
2,"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,","Chun, Asa chun lal in le LALPA ina ro sie khâwmna ina rângkachak le tangkaruo chu a lâk suok a; Damaskaa um, Suria lal Benhadad kuoma chun ân phur a,"
3,"There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.","“Kei le nanga kâra hin inthu- ruolna a um a, i pa le ka pa inkâra khawm a lo um tah ang khan; ngai ta, tangkaruo le rângkachak ka hung thawn che hi; fe la, Israel ram lal Baasa le in inkâra inthuruolna chu ṭhiek rawh, keimaa inthawka a fe hmang theina dingin,” a ta."
4,"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.","Chun, Benhadad chun lal Asa thu chu a pawm a; Israel ram khaw- puihai chunga chun a sipaihai chu a tir tah a; chuongchun, Ijon le Dan le Abel-maim le Naphtali rama sie- khâwmna khawpuihai po po chu an rûn a."
5,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.","Chun, Baasa chun chu chu a lo hriet chun Rama khuo a siem lai chu a châwlsan a, a sin chu a suktâwp tah a."
6,"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.","Chun, Juda lal Asa chun Juda rama mi po po chu a ṭhuoi a; Ramaa lunghai le chutaka thinghai Baasain in bâwlna dinga a hmanghai chu an phur hmang vawng a; chu chun Geba le Mizpa khuo a siem a."
7,"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.","Chu hun lai chun zâwlnei Hanani chu Juda ram lal Asa kuoma chun a hung a, a kuomah, “LALPA i Pathien chu ring loin Suria lal chu i ring a, chuleiin, Suria lal sipaihai chu i kuta chun an suokthleng ding a nih."
8,"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.","Lubim mihai le Ethiopia mihai chu sakawr tawlailîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai leh tam nasatak an ni naw am a nih? amiruokchu, LALPAA chun în nghat leiin i kut- ah anni chu a pêk suok che an ni kha."
9,"For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.","Ama tienga lungril ṭha famkim puttuhai chunga a hrâtzie insuklang dingin LALPA mit chun hnuoi chung po poa kil le kap a en vêl ruoi hlak. Hitaka hin nang chun invêtthlâktak el chun i lo thaw tah a, chuleiin, tuta chin chu indonahai khawm nei zing tâng i tih,” a ta."
10,"Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.","Chun, Asa chu zâwlnei chunga chun a lunginsen a, lung ina chun ama chu a khum tah a; hi thil lei hin ama chunga chun a lunginsen sih a. Chun, Asa chun chuong lai chun mi ṭhenkhathai chu a lo nêksawr hle bawk a."
11,"And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","Asa thilthawhai, a hmasa le a nuhnunghai khawm, en ta, Juda le Israel ram lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a ni naw am a nih?"
12,"And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to Jehovah, but to the physicians.","A rorêl a kum sâwmthum pakuo kuma chun Asa chu a ke a hung na tah a; a natna chu a nasa hle el a, a natnaa khawm chun LALPA chu a la zawng naw rawp a, damdawi thiem mihai a ruoi lem a."
13,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.","Chuongchun, Asa chu a thlatu hai kuoma chun a in tah a, a rorêl kum sâwmli pakhat kuma chun a thi tah a."
14,"And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.","Ama thlân in David khuoa a siem ngeia chun an phûm tah a; chun, riminhnik le chawkpawl thiem mi- haiin an buotsai riminhnik tinrênga sip khuma chun an inzâltir a; ama ta ding chun meichawk nasatak chu an siem tah a."
