1,Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.,"Manasse chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmpahnia upa a na, Jerusalema chun kum sâwmnga panga sûng ro a rêl a."
2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.","Ama chun LALPAIN Israel mi- hai hmaa a hnawt suokhai, khawhri be mihai tirdakumna ang chun LALPA mithmuah thil ṭha naw chu a thawh a."
3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.","A pa Hezekiain a lo suksiet ta hnung bâwlhmunhai kha a siem ṭha nâwk a; Baal ta dingin mâichâmhai a dâw thar nâwk bawk a; Asera a siem a, vâna thil umhai po po chu chibai a bûk a, an rawng a bâwl bawk a."
4,"And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.","Chun, LALPA ina chun mâi- châmhai a siem a, LALPA chun a kuoma, “Jerusalema hin ka hming chu kumkhuoin um zing a tih,” a tinaa chun."
5,And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.,LALPA in tuolpûk pahnia chun vâna thil umhai po po ta ding chun mâichâmhai a siem a.
6,"He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.","Hinnom naupa ruoma chun a nauhai chu mei ân fêthlengtir bawk a; aisân a hmang a, zâwldiaihai a hmang a, dâwi a hmang bawk a, thlarau zâwlhai a sawr bawk a, thiemrauhai leh; LALPA mithmua chun thil suol nasatak el ama chu suklungsen dingin a thaw tah a."
7,"And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:","Chun, milim kerṭielhai, ama siem chu LALPA ina chun a sie a; chu chungthua chun Pathien chun David le a naupa Solomon kuoma chun, “Hi ina le Jerusalema khawm, Israel hnam po po laia inthawka ka thlang suoka hin, kumkhuoa dingin ka hming chu sieng ka ta,"
8,"neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses.","in thlatuhai ta dinga ram ka iruot taha inthawk chun Israel kepha chu sawn ta bawk naw ning a; Mosie hmanga thupêkhai, thuruothai, dân- hai po po, anni thu ka pêkhai po po chu an thaw phawt chun,” a lo tina LALPA ina chun a sie a nih."
9,"And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.","Manasse chun Juda le Jerusa- lema umhai chu ân suksuoltir a; chuongchun, Israelhai hmaa LALPA- IN a sukbohmang hnamhai nêk hman khan thil suol an thaw nasa lem a."
10,"And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.","Chuongchun, Manasse le a mi- hai kuoma chun LALPA chun thu a hril a, nisienlakhawm, an pawisa nawh a."
11,"Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.","Chuleiin, LALPAIN Assuria lal sipai hotuhai chu a hung ṭhuoi a, Manasse chu khaidietin an khit a, thîr kawl an inbuntir a, Babulonah an fepui tah a."
12,"And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.","Chuongchun, rimsitaka a hung um huna chun LALPA a Pathien chu a zawng a, a thlatuhai Pathien hmaa chun ama le ama chu nasatakin ân sukhnuoi tah a."
13,"And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.","Chun, ama kuoma chun a ṭawngṭai a, ama chu dawnsakin a um a, a hnina chu ngaiin a um a, ama ramah, Jerusalema chun hung ṭhuoi nâwkin a um tah a. Chun, Manasse chun LALPA chu Pathien a nih ti a hriet tah a."
14,"Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.","Chun, hi hnunga hin Nga dai Kawtkhâr lûtna, phairuom a, Gihon sîr thlang a, David khawpui dang a puo lema chun kul a bâwl a; Ophel tieng a sukkuol a, insângtakin a suk- sâng a; chun, Juda rama khawpui kul neiahai chun hotu thilthawthei- takhai a sie tâwl a."
15,"And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.","Chun, Pathien danglamhai le, milimhai chu LALPA ina inthawk chun a lâk suok a, LALPA in tlânga mâichâm a lo siem tahai po po le, Jerusalema mihai le khan a lâk hmang vawng a; khawpui puoa chun a peihâwn tah a."
16,"And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.","LALPA mâichâm chu a buotsai a, chutaka chun inremna thilinhlân- hai, lâwmthu hrilna inthâwinahai ân hlân a, Israel Pathien LALPA rawng chu bâwl dingin Juda mihai chu thu a pêk tah a."
17,"Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God.","Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chu bâwlhmunhaiah an lân thâwi ta rawp a chu, LALPA an Pathien kuoma chun a nih an inthâwi."
18,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.","Manasse thilthaw danghai le a Pathien kuoma a ṭawngṭaina dâm le Israel Pathien, LALPA hminga a kuoma zâwlneiin a hril thuhai dâm chu ngai ta, Israel lalhai thilthawhai lai chun ziek a nih."
19,"His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.","A ṭawngṭaina dâm, ama Pathienin a lo ngaisak dânhai dâm, a suolna po po le a bawsietna po po le, bâwlhmun a siemna hmunhai le, ama le ama ân sukhnuoi hmaa Asera a siem dâm le, milim ker a siemhai thu chu, ngai ta, Hozai chanchinbua chun ziek an nih."
20,"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Manasse chu a thlatuhai lai a in tah a, ama ina ngei chun an phûm tah a, a naupa Amon chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
21,Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.,Amon chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pahnia upa a na; Jerusa- lema chun kum hni sûng ro a rêl a.
22,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.","A pa Manasse ang bawk khan, LALPA mithmuah thil suol chu a thawh a; Amon chu a pa Manassein milim ker a lo siem tahai po po kuoma khan ân thawi a, an rawng a bâwl a."
23,"And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.","A pa Manasse ân sukhnuoi ta ang khan ama hi chu LALPA hmaa chun ân sukhnuoi ve nawh a; chuong- chun, hi Amon hi chu a suol nasa deu deu tah a."
24,"And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.","Chun, a siehlawhai chun ama chu an phierrûk a, ama in sûnga ngei chun an that tah a."
25,But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.,"Amiruokchu, chu rama mihai chun lal Amon phierrutuhai po po an that a; chun, chu rama mipuihai chun a naupa Josia chu ama aia chun lalah an siem tah a."
