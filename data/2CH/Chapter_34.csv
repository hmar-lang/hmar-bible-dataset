1,Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.,"Rorêl a ṭan chun Josia chu kum rieta upa a na, Jerusa- lema chun kum sâwmthum pakhat sûng ro a rêl a."
2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.","LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thawh a, a thlatu David lampuihai chu a hrawh a, changtienga manih, vawitienga manih khawm a pêthmang nawh a."
3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.","Naupang a la ni laiin, a rorêl a kum rietnaa inthawk chun a thlatu David Pathien chu a zawng ṭan a; chun, kum sâwmpahninaa chun Juda ram le Jerusalem chu Asera dâm, milim a kera kerhai dâm, milim a sunga sunghai dâm le bâwlhmun po poa inthawk chun a sukthieng ṭan tah a."
4,"And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.","Ama hmaihmaa ngei chun Baal mâichâmhai chu a sukchim a; nisa milimhai, chuonghai chung daia um- hai chu a phûr thlûk a; Asera le milim a kera kerhai le a sunga sunghai chu a vuok nâwi vawng a, pilvutin a siem a, an kuoma lo inthâwi hlaktuhai thlân chungahai chun a phul a."
5,"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.","Chun, thiempuhai ruhai chu an mâichâmhai chunga chun a rawh a, Juda ram le Jerusalem chu a suk- thieng a."
6,"And so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about.","Chun, Manasse le Ephraim le Simeon khawpuihaia, Naphtali chen- in, an sietna hmun vêlahai chun chuong ang chun a thaw bawk a."
7,"And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.","Chun, mâichâmhai chu a suk- chim a, Asera chu, milim a kera kerhai le chun a vuok nâwi vawng a, Israel ram po poa inthawk chun nisa milimhai po po chu a phûr thlûk vawng a, Jerusalema chun a kîr nâwk tah a."
8,"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.","Chun, chuonga ram le in chu a sukthieng laia a rorêlna a kum sâwm pariet kum chun, Azalia naupa Saphan hai, khawpui sûng rorêltu Maaseia hai, Joahaz naupa Joa, thil inchiktuhai chu a Pathien LALPA in chu siem ṭha dingin a tir tah a."
9,"And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Thiempu laltak Hilkia kuoma chun an hung a, Levi mi kawtkhâr vêngtuhaiin Manasse le Ephraim mihai kuta inthawk le, Israel mi a la um sun po poa inthawk dâm, Juda le Benjamin mi po poa inthawk dâm, Jerusalema chêngtuhaia inthawka an lâk khâwmhai, Pathien ina sum hung lâka umhai kha, an hung pêk a."
10,And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house:,"Chun, chu chu LALPA in en- kawlna sin thawtuhai kuta chun an pêk a; chun, LALPA ina sinthawtuhai chu in siem ṭhatna ding le bâwl ṭhatna ding chun an pêk a,"
11,"even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.","in bâwltuhai le thingrem siem- tuhai kuoma lung saksahai, thing a zawmna dinghai inchâwkna ding le, Juda lalin a lo suksiet tah in bâwlna dinga thingtumhai siemna dingin."
12,"And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all that were skilful with instruments of music.","Mihai chun sin chu ringumtak- in an thawh a; annihai enkawltuhai chu Merari naupasalhai, Levi mi Jahath le Obadia hai; Kohath mi naupasalhai Zekaria le Mesullam hai chu an nih; Levi mihai, thil ri sutna thilhaia themthiem taphawthai chu."
13,"Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.","Chun, phurrik phurtuhai en- kawltuhai khawm an ni bawk a, rawngbâwlna sin chu kawng ieng anga khawm an enkawl pei a; chun, Levi mihai chu ziektuhai, hotuhai le kawtkhâr vêngtuahai an um a."
14,"And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah given by Moses.","Chun, LALPA ina tangka lâk lûta um chu an hung lâk suok chun, Hilkia chun Mosien a pêk, LALPA dân lekhabu chu a hmusuok a."
15,"And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.","Chun, Hilkia chun a dawn a, lekhaziektu Saphan kuoma chun, “LALPA ina chun dân lekhabu chu kan hmusuok tah,” a ta. Chuongchun, Hilkia chun lekhabu chu Saphan kuoma chun a pêk tah a."
16,"And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing.","Saphan chun lekha chu lal kuoma chun a chawi a; Saphan chun lal kuoma chun thu a hung intlun nâwk a, “I siehlaw hai kuoma thaw dinga pêk ang khan an thaw a;"
17,"And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.","LALPA ina tangka hmua um kha an bun suok a, sinthawtuhai kuta le a enkawltuhai kuta chun an pêk suok tah a,” tiin."
18,"And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king.","Chun, ziektu Saphan chun lal kuoma chun, “Thiempu Hilkia chun lekhabu a mi lo pêk a,” a ta. Chun, chutaka chun Saphan chun lal hmaa chun a tiem tah a."
19,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.","Chun, lal chun dân thuhai chu a hriet chun a puonhai a keithlêr a."
20,"And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,","Chun, lal chun Hilkia hai, Saphan naupa Ahikam hai, Mika naupa Abdon hai le lekhaziektu Saphan le lal siehlaw Asaia chu thu a pêk a,"
21,"Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according unto all that is written in this book.","“Fe unla, kei le, Juda le Israel rama mâksana la umhai ta ding hin lekhabu hmu suoka um thu ang khan LALPA mi hung râwnpêk ta u; lekha- bua ziek po po, ang taka thaw dinga, ei thlatuhai chun LALPA thu chu an lo pawm ta naw lei khan, LALPA lunginsenna ei chunga bunthlâka um hi a nasa a nih,” tiin."
22,"So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they spake to her to that effect.","Chuongchun, Hilkia le lalin a tirhai po po chu, silfên vêngtu Hasra naupa Tokath naupa Sallum nuhmei, zâwlneinu Hulda kuoma chun an fe tah a, (chuong lai chun Jerusalema vêng pahninaa chun a um a nih), a kuoma chun chuong thua chun thu an hril tah a."
23,"And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,","Ama chun an kuomah, “Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Ka kuoma nangni hung tirtu cheu kuoma chun hieng hin hril ro,"
24,"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, Ngai ta u, hi hmuna le hi hmun hluotuhai chunga chun thil ṭha naw ka hung intlungtir ding a nih; Juda ram lal hmaa an tiem tah lekhabua khâng ṭawngsiehai po po kha,"
25,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.","kei an mi lo nghatsan tah a; an kut sinthawhaia lunginsen dinga an mi chawktho theina dingin pathien danghai kuoma chun riminhnikhai an rawh a; chuleiin, ka lunginsenna chu hi hmun chunga hin bunthlâk a ni tah a, sukre el ni ta naw nih,’ tiin."
26,"But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,","Amiruokchu, Juda lal, LALPA chu thu indawn dinga tirtu cheu kuoma chun hieng hin hril in ta, Israel Pathien LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Thu i lo hriet ta chungthua chun,"
27,"because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.","hi hmun le a sûnga chênghai chungthua, thuhai chu i hriet phinga i lungril ân nêm a, nangma le nangma chu Pathien hmaa chun în sukhnuoi leiin le, i puonhai i keithlêr a, ka hmaa chun i ṭap leiin kei khawma ka hung hriet ve che a nih."
28,"Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.","Ngai ta, i thlatuhai kuomah infetir ka ti cheh a, i thlâna chun thlamuongtakin fêng i ta, hi hmun le a sûnga umhai chunga thil ṭha naw ka hung intlungtir dinghai po po chu i mithaiin hmu naw nih a tih,’ ti ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, lal chu, thu chu an hung intlun nâwk a."
29,Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.,"Chun, lal chun mi a tir a, Jerusalem le Juda rama upahai po po chu a ko khâwm tah a."
30,"And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, lal chu LALPA ina chun a hang feh a; Juda rama mi po pohai le Jerusalema chêngtuhai le, thiem- puhai le Levi mihai le, mi po po a chîn a lienin an hang fe veh a; LALPA ina thuthlungna lekhabu hmua um sûnga thuhai po po an na hrieta chun a tiem tah a."
31,"And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.","Chun, lal chu a hmuna chun a ngîr a, LALPA chu zui a, a thupêkhai, a thuinhriettirhai, a thuruothai chu a lungril po po le a lungvar po poa zâwm a, lekhabua thuthlung thu zieka umhai po po chu thaw dingin LALPA hmaa chun thuthlung a siem tah a."
32,"And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.","Chun, Benjamin le Jerusalema umhai po po chu chuong anga um dingin a tih a. Jerusalema chênghai chun an thlatu Pathien, Pathien thuthlung ang chun an thawh a."
33,"And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Chun, Josia chun Israel thlahai ihluo ram po poa inthawk chun tirdakumna po po chu a lâk hmang a, Israel rama umhai po po LALPA an Pathien rawng chu ân bâwltir a. A dam sûng po po chun an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA zuinaa inthawk chun an pêthmang nawh a."
