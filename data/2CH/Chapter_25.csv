1,"Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.","Amazia chu ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmhni pangaa upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmhni pakuo ro a rêl a, a nu hming chu Jehoaddan, Jerusalem mi a nih."
2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.","LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thawh a; amiruokchu, lungril ṭha famkim leh ni loin."
3,"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.","Lalram chu ama ta dinga sukdet a ni phing chun, a pa lal thattu a siehlawhai kha a that tâwl a."
4,"But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.","Nisienlakhawm, an nauhai chu a that nawh a, LALPA thupêk ang a, Mosie lekhabua dâna ziek angin a thaw lem tah a; “Nauhai ta dingin pahai chu thi naw ni hai a, nauhai chu pahai ta dingin thi bawk naw ni hai; amiruokchu, mi tin mâni suolna senga ding chun thi lem an tih,” tiin."
5,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.","Chunawa khawm Amazia chun Juda mihai chu a ko khâwm a, Juda le Benjamin chia mi po pohai chu za pâwl hotu hnuoia dâm, sâng pâwl hotu hnuoia dâm an pahnam ang peiin an inumtir a; kum sâwmhni le a chungtienga mi po chu a tiem a, phâw le fei hmang thei, indo dinga fe suok thei ṭhieu le thlangsuok ṭhieu mi nuoi thum an um a."
6,He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.,"Chun, tangka talent za khatin Israel rama inthawkin mi huoisen nuoi khat a ruoi bawk a."
7,"But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien mi a kuomah a hung a, “Aw lalpa, Israel sipaihai hi nanga ruolin fe ve naw raw hai se, Israelhai kuoma chun LALPA chu a um si nawh a; anih, Ephraim thlahai po po huomin."
8,"But if thou wilt go, do valiantly, be strong for the battle: God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down.","Nisienlakhawm, in fe suok a ni hrim hrim chun, huoitakin thaw la, indonaa chun va hrât rawh, hmêl- mahai hmaa chun Pathien chun suktlâwm a ti che; Pathien chun ṭhangpui ding le pei thla dingin thilthawtheina a nei sih a,” a ta."
9,"And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.","Amazia chun Pathien mi kuoma chun, “Anleh, Israel sipaihai kuoma tangka talent za ka lo pêk ta chu ieng tin am thâwng ei ti leh?” a ta. Pathien mi chun, “Hi nêka tam khawm hi pe ding chein LALPA chu a thei a nih,” tiin a dawn a."
10,"Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.","Amazia chun, Ephraima in- thawka a kuoma sipai hunghai kha an in tienga fe nâwk el dingin a ṭhe thlâk tah a; chuongchun, Judahai chunga chun an lungsen chu nasa- takin a chawk tah a, lunginsen ṭium- tak chun in an inlawi nâwk tah a."
11,"And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.","Chun, Amazia chu ân sukhuoi a, a mihai chu a ṭhuoi suok a, Chi Ruoma chun a fe tah a; Seir thlahai sîng khat rau chu a hang hne tah a."
12,"And other ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they were all broken in pieces.","Chun, mi dang sîng khat bawk chu Juda thlahai chun a hringin an ṭhuoi a, lungpui sîpa chun an hung ṭhuoi a, chuongchun, lungpui sîpa inthawk chun an pei thlâk a, an rêng chun an inphit vawng tâwl tah a."
13,"But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.","Chun, sipai pâwla mihai chu, indo dinga ama le fe lo dinga Amazia chun a tirkirhai khan Samaria inthawk Beth-horon chenin Juda ram khawpuihai chu an hang rûn a, mi sâng thum an that a, râllâk sum tamtak an lâk bawk a."
14,"Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.","Chun, Amazia chu Edom mihai that a hung kîr hnung chun, Seir thlahai pathien chu a hung lâk a, a pathienhai ni dingin a sieh a, an hmaa chun a kûn a, an kuoma chun riminhnikhai a raw tah a."
15,"Wherefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?","Chuleichun, LALPA lunginsen chu Amazia chunga chun a hung ṭal tah a, a kuoma chun zâwlnei a tir a, a kuomah, “I kuta inthawka an mihai ngei khawm sanhim thei si lo, mipuihai pathienhai chu iengdinga i zawng am a na?” a tih a."
16,"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Have we made thee of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.","Chun, ama le an inbiek zing lai chun lal chun a kuomah, “Lal thurawnpuituah kan siem che am a nih? Fîmkhur rawh; iengdingin am thatin um i ta?” a ta. Chuongchun, zâwlnei chun, “Ka thurâwn chu i pawisa nawh a, hi thil hi i thaw leiin, Pathien chun suksiet a tum che a nih ti ka hriet a nih,” a ta, a to tah a."
17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.","Chun, Juda ram lal Amazia chun thurawn a lâk a, Israel lal Jehu naupa Jehoahaz naupa Joas kuomah mi a tir a, “Hung ta, hmai le hmaisan ngeiah hang inen ei tih,” tiin."
18,"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.","Chun, Israel ram lal Joas chun Juda ram lal Amazia kuoma chun mi a tir a, “Lebanona hlingbukin Leba- nona Sidar thing kâwlah mi tirin, ‘I naunu kha ka naupa nuhmei dingin pe rawh,’ tiin; chun, Lebanona ram- sahai chu an hung a, hlingbuk chu an chîl thlûk tah a."
19,"Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?","A ni luo, ‘Edom chu ka hang hneh a’ i ta, i lungrilin uong dingin a dawm sâng che a ni hi; i inah um ṭawk ṭawk el rawh, i sietna ding chu chawksuok ṭâl dîm nîng a ti; nang tlûng i ta, nang ngei chu, chun nang le chun Juda ram chu tlu bawk a tih,” a ta."
20,"But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.","Amiruokchu, Amazia chun a ngai chuong nawh a, an hmêlmahai kuta a pêk theina dinga Pathien ithaw a nih, Edom pathienhai an lo zawng ta lei khan."
21,"So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.","Chuongchun, Israel ram lal Joas chu a hang feh a; Juda rama Beth-semesa chun ama le Juda ram lal Amazia chu hmaisan ngeia chun an inen tah a."
22,And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.,Israel hmaa chun Juda chan chu a se nâwkzuol tah a; mi tin chu mâni puon ina seng an tlânse tah a.
23,"And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.","Chun, Israel ram lal Joas chun Jehoahaz naupa Joas naupa Juda ram lal Amazia chu Beth-semesa chun a man a, Jerusalema chun a hung ṭhuoi a, Ephraim tienga dâi kawtkhâra inthawka a kia dâi kawtkhâr chen, tawng za li zet Jerusalem kul chu a vuok chim a."
24,"And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.","Chun, Obed-edom le Pathien ina rângkachak le tangkaruo le bûr le bêlhai po po, lal ina ro thilhluhai le, hrên ding salhai le chun a lâk a, Samaria chun a kîr tah a."
25,And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.,"Chun, Israel lal Jehoahaz nau- pa Joas thi hnung chun Juda lal Joas naupa Amazia chu kum sâwmpanga a la dam a."
26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?","Chun, Amazia thilthaw dang- hai, a hmasa le nuhnunghai khawm chu, ngai ta, Israel le Juda lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a ni naw am a nih?"
27,"Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.","Chun, Amazia chu LALPA zuinaa inthawka ân herhmang china khan chu Jerusalema chun ama chunga phierrûkna an siem a, Lakis tieng chen a tlânseh a, amiruokchu, Lakis tieng chun mi an tir pei a, chutaka chun an that tah a."
28,"And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.","Chun, a ruong chu sakawr chungah an hung lâk a, a thlatuhai laiah David khawpuia chun an phûm tah a."
