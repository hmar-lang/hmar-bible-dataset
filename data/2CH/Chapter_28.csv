1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father;",Ahaz chun ro a rêl ṭanin kum sâwmhnia upa a na; Jerusa- lema chun kum sâwmparuk sûng ro a rêl a; a thlatu David ang khan LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thaw ve nawh a;
2,"but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim.","amiruokchu, Israel lalhai lampui chu a hrawh a, Baal ta ding chun milim a sunga sunghai chu a siem bawk a."
3,"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.",Chunawa khawm chun Hinnom naupa ruoma chun riminhnik a rawh a; Israel thlahai hmaa LALPAIN a hnawtsuok khawhri be mihai tirdak- umna ang tak chun a nauhai chu meiah ân lûttir bawk a.
4,"And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.","Thing hring tin hnuoia le muol haia le, bâwlhmunhaia chun rimin- hnik a rawh a, ân thâwi bawk a."
5,"Wherefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.","Chuleichun, LALPA a Pathien chun Suria lal kuta chun ama chu a pêk tah a, ama chu an hung thawh a, a mi tamtakhai chu salah an ṭhuoi a, Damaskaa chun an hung ṭhuoi tâwl tah a. Nasataka thata hnetu Israel lal kuta chun ama khawm chu pêk a ni tah a."
6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.","Remalia naupa Peka chun Judai ramah, mi hrât khawkhêng ṭhieu nuoi khat le sîng hni ni khat sûngin a that a; an thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu an nghatsan leiin."
7,"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.","Chun, Ephraima mi thil thaw- theitak Zikri chun lal naupa Maaseia le insûng rorêltu Azrikam le lal dawttu Elkana chu a that bawk a."
8,"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.","Chun, Israel thlahai chun an unauhai chu sal nuoi hni, nuhmei le naunuhmeihai le naupasalhai leh an ṭhuoi hmang a; chun, râllâk sum tamtak an lâk bawk a; chu râllâk sum chu Samariaa chun an hung lâk a."
9,"But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up unto heaven.","Amiruokchu, LALPA zâwlnei chutaka chun a lo um a, a hming chu Oded a nih; ama chu sipai ruol Samariaa hung lût dinghai chu tuok dingin a feh a, an kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, in thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu Juda ram chunga chun a lunginsen leiin anni chu an kutah a pêk tah a, chun, anni chu lunginsenin in that a, chu chu vânah a hang tlung tah a nih."
10,And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?,"Tuhin Juda thlahai le Jerusa- lema mihai chu suoknuhai, suokpa- haia siem in lungril a na; amiruokchu, in Pathien LALPA chunga nangni ngei bawsietna chu nangnia ngei khawm hin a um ve a ni naw am a nih?"
11,"Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.","Chuleiin, tuhin mi lo ngai unla, in unauhai ngei sala in hung ṭhuoi- hai, salhai chu tirkîr nâwk vawng ro, LALPA lunginsenna ṭiumtak chu in chungah a um sih a,” a ta."
12,"Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,","Chun, Ephraim thlahai laia ṭhuoitu ṭhenkhathai, Johanan naupa Azaria hai, Mesillemoth naupa Berekia hai, Sallum naupa Jehizkia hai, Hadlai naupa Amasa hai chun indonaa inthawka hunghai chu an lo dang a,"
13,"and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.","an kuoma chun, “Hitaka hin salhai chu in hung ṭhuoi ding a ni nawh: ei bawsietna le ei suolnahai belsa dingin, LALPA chungah baw- sietna mîn tluntir in tum a ni hi; ei bawsietnahai chu a nasa êm êm a, Israel chunga hin lunginsenna ṭium- tak chu a um a nih,” an lo tih a."
14,So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.,"Chuongchun, inrâlthuomhai chun salhai le râllâk sumhai chu hotuhai hmaa le mipui inkhâwmhai hmaa chun an mâksan tah a."
15,"And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.","Chun, khieng an hming hrila umhai khi an tho a, salhai chu an ṭhuoi a, râllâk thilhai chu anni laia saruoka umhai chu an insiltir a, anni chu an inthuom a, kekawk an inbun- tir a, fâk ding le dâwn ding an pêk a, hriek an nâl a, anni laia hrât nawhai po po chu sabengtung chungah an inchuongtir a, an unauhai kuomah, intûm khawpui Jerikoa chun an hung ṭhuoi tah a; chun, chutaka inthawk chun Samariaa chun an kîr nâwk tah a."
16,At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.,Chuong hun laia chun lal Ahaz chun Assuria lal chu ama ṭhangpui dinga fiel dingin mi a tir a.
17,"For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.","Edom mihai chu an hung nâwk a, Juda ram chu an hung rûn a, salah an ṭhuoi tâwl sih a."
18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dwelt there.","Philistin mihai khawma Juda ram Simtienga phaia khawpuihai chu an hung rûn a, Beth-semes hai, Aijalon hai, Gederoth hai, Soko hai an khawperhai leh, Timna le a khaw- perhai leh, Gimzo le a khawperhai leh an lâk a, chuongahai chun an um a."
19,"For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah.","Israel lal Ahaz leiin, LALPAIN Judahai chu a hung suktlâwm a; ama chu Judahai chunga nuomtâwka a khawsak lei le LALPA chunga a bawsiet nasa êm leiin."
20,"And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.","Assuria lal Tiglath-pileser chu a kuomah a hung a, ama chu sukdet nêkin a sukrimsi hle a."
21,"For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.","Ahaz chun LALPA ina chanvo le, lal nauhai in le lal ina mi chu a lâk suok a, Assuria lal chu a lo pêk a; nisienlakhawm, a ṭhangkaipui chuong nawh a."
22,"And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.","Chuongchun, hi lal Ahaz hi, a lunginzîng hun laia khawm chun LALPA chungah a bawsiet zuol det pei a."
23,"For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.","Damaska mihai, ama hung rûntuhai pathienhai chu a biek a, ama chun, “Suria lalhai pathien- haiin anni a ṭhangpui leiin, kei khawm an mi ṭhangpui theina dingin an kuomah inthâwi ka tih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, ama sietna le Israel ram sûng po po sietna a ni lem tah a."
24,"And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.","Chun, Ahaz chun Pathien ina bûr le bêlhai chu a lâk khâwm a, Pathien ina bûr le bêlhai chu a vuok- nawi vawng a; LALPA in kawtkhâr- hai chu a khâr vawng tah a; chun, Jerusalem kil tina chun ama ta dingin mâichâm a siem a."
25,"And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.","Chun, Juda khawpui hmun tam- taka chun Pathien danghai kuoma riminhnik rawna dingin bâwlhmun- hai a siem a, a thlatuhai Pathien LALPA chu a chawk lungsen ta deu deu a."
26,"Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","A thilthaw danghai chu, a nung- chang tinrênghai leh, a hmasa le nuhnung khawm chu, ngai ta, Juda le Israel lalhai lekhabua chun ziek an nih."
27,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Ahaz chu a thlatuhai laia chun a in tah a, khawpuiah, Jerusa- lema chun an phûm tah a; Israel lalhai thlân ina chun an sie nawh a; chun, a naupa Hezekia chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
