1,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.","Chun, a kum sari kum chun Jehoiada chu ân sukhrât a, sipai za pâwl chunga hotuhai, Jeho- ram naupa Azaria hai, Jehohanan naupa Ismael hai, Obed naupa Azaria hai, Adaia naupa Maaseia hai, Zikri naupa Elisaphat hai le chun thu a thlung a."
2,"And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’ houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.","Chun, Juda ram sûnga chun a fe vêl a, Juda khawpui po poa inthawk chu Levi mihai le, Israel pahnam ṭhuoituhai le chun a lâk khâwm a, Jerusalema chun an fe tah a."
3,"And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the sons of David.","Chun, mipui inkhâwmhai po po chun Pathien ina chun lal le thutiem an siem tah a. Chun, an kuomah a hril a, “David naupasalhai chungthu LALPAIN a hril ta angin, en ta u lal naupa hin ro a rêl ding a na."
4,"This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;","Hi hi thil in thaw ding chu hung nîng a tih: Châwlnia hung hlak, thiempuhai le Levi mihai hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu kawtkhâr vêngtuhai nîng in ta;"
5,and a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.,"a hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat dang chu lal inah um an ta, a hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat dang chu lungphûmna dai kawtkhâr bulah um an ta; chun, mipui po po chu LALPA in inhuonna tuol sûnglaia chun um an tih."
6,"But let none come into the house of Jehovah, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the charge of Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, thiempuhai ti chau naw chu mi tukhawm LALPA ina chun fe naw raw hai se; Levi mi rawngbâwltuhai le chau chun anni chu hung lût an tih, an inthieng sih a; amiruokchu, mipuihai po po chun LALPA chu an nghâk seng ding a nih."
7,"And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.","Levi mihai chun, mi tin an râlthuomhai chawi sengin lal chu ngîr huol an ta; amiruokchu, mi tukhawm LALPA ina hung lût chu that ni raw se; nangni chu lal a hung lût le a fe suok huna chun a kâwla chun um zing in tih,” tiin."
8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.","Chuongchun, Levi mihai le Juda mihai po po chun thiempu Jehoiadain thu a pêk ang tak chun an thaw tah a; mi tin chun anni mihai châwlnia fe suok dinghai le hung lût dinghai chu an ṭhuoi vêl a; thiempu Jehoiada chun a ṭîn ding pâwlhai chu ân thlengtir si nawh a."
9,"And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in the house of God.","Thiempu Jehoiada chun Pathien ina um, lal David ta phawthai dâm, feihai dâm, âwmphâwhai dâm chu sipai za pâwl hotuhai kuoma chun a pêk suok tâwl a."
10,"And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.","Mipuihai po po, mi tin el chu a râlthuom a kutah chawiin, lal sîrvêla le, in mâichâm sirvêl po poa chun, in sîr changtieng panga inthawka in sîr vawitieng panga chen chun ân umtir a."
11,"Then they brought out the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony, and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said, Long live the king.","Chun, lal naupa chu an hung ṭhuoi suok a, lallukhum an inkhumtir a, thuinhriettir chu an pêk a; chuong- chun, lalah an siem tah a; chun, Jehoiada le a naupasalhai chun ama chu hriek an nâl a, “Lal hi Pathienin sandam raw se,” an tih a."
12,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:","Chun, Athalia chun mipui tlân vêl ri le lal an chawimawi ri chu a hrietin, LALPA ina chun mipuihai kuoma chun a va feh tah a;"
13,"and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also played on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!","chun, a hei en a, lûtna bula chun lal chu a sûtpui kâwla chun a ngîr a, sipai hotuhai le tawtawrâwt puhai khawm chu lal kâwla chun an um a. Chuongchun, ram sûng mi po po chu an hlim bêk bêk a, tawtawrâwthai an mût a; hla saktuhai khawm chun hla sakna thuomhnawhai chu sutin, chawimawina hla chu an sak tah a. Chun, Athalia chun a puonhai chu a keithlêr a, “Phierrûkna, phierrûkna,” tiin a khêk a."
14,"And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, thiempu Jehoiada chun sipai pâwl chunga siea um, za pâwl hotuhai chu a hung ṭhuoi suok a, an kuomah, “Sipai tlarhai kâra khan insuoktir ro; tukhawm ama zui taphawt chu kâwlhnâma that nîng an tih, thiempu chun, ‘LALPA ina chun ama chu that naw ro,’ a ti sih a,” a ta."
15,So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house: and they slew her there.,"Chuongchun, ama ta ding chun lampui chu an inken a, lal ina sakawr kawtkhâr lûtna tieng chun a feh a; chutaka chun an that tah a."
16,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah’s people.","Chun, Jehoiada chun ama le mipuihai po po le, lal inkâra chun LALPA mihai chu an ni ding a nih, tiin thuthlung a siem tah a."
17,"And all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.","Chun, mipui po po chu Baal ina chun an va feh a, an suksiet a, a mâichâmhai le a limhai chu an suk- nâwi vawng a; Baal thiempu Mattan chu mâichâm hmaa chun an that tah a."
18,"And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.","Chun, Jehoiada chun LALPA ina sinthawnahai chu thiempu Levi mihai kuta chun a ruot tah a; chuonghai chu Mosie dâna ziek anga LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilin- hlânhai, David thu lo pêk ta anga hlimtak le hla sak puma inhlân dinga LALPA ina Davidin a lo semdar tahai chu an nih."
19,"And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that none that was unclean in anything should enter in.","Chun, LALPA in dâi kawtkhâra chun kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu a sieh a, mi tukhawm, ieng thila khawm inthieng nawna nei chu an lût nawna dingin."
20,"And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they came through the upper gate unto the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.","Chun, za pâwl hotuhai, mi ṭhahai, mipui rorêltuhai le chu rama mi po pohai chu a ṭhuoi a, LALPA ina inthawk chun lal chu a hung ṭhuoi thlâk tah a; chun, dâi kawtkhâr sakhnungah hungin lal ina chun an hung a, lal chu lalram lalṭhungphaa chun an inṭhungtir tah a."
21,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword.","Chuongchun, chu rama mipui- hai po po chu an hlim êm êm a, khaw- pui chu râlmuongin a um a, Athalia chu kâwlhnâmin an that tah a."
