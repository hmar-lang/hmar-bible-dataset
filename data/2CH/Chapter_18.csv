1,Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.,"Jehosaphat chun hausaknahai le inzâkaina chu nasatakin a nei a, chun, Ahab le chun inpum- khatna chu a siem tah a."
2,"And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.","Kum ieng zât amani hnunga chun Ahab kuomah Samaria chun a zu fe thla a. Chun, Ahab chun ama le ama hung zuituhai ta dingin bâwng- chalhai le berâmhai tamtak a thatpêk a; chuongchun, ama le Ramoth- gileada hang fe dingin a fiel tah a."
3,"And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.","Israel ram lal Ahab chun Juda ram lal Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Ramoth-gileadah ei hang fe ding?” a ta. Ama chun, “Kei le nang ka mihai le i mihai pumkhat ei na; indonaa chun, nangni leh ṭhang hmunkhat kan tih,” a ta."
4,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.","Jehosaphat chun Israel ram lal kuoma chun, “Vawisûn hin LALPA thu chu indawn raw khai, ka hni che hi,” a ta."
5,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chuongchun, Israel ram lal chun zâwlnei za li lai chu a ko khâwm a, an kuomah, “Ramoth-gileada chun indo dingin kan hang fe ding am, an- nawleh ka tosan el ding?” a ta. Anni chun, “Hang fe ro, Pathien chun lal kutah a pêk suok ding a ni sih a,” an ta."
6,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?","Nisienlakhawm, Jehosaphat chun, “Hienghai naw hi ei râwn thei ding LALPA zâwlnei dang hrim an um naw am a nih?” a ta."
7,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.","Israel lal chun Jehosaphat kûoma chun, “Mi pakhat LALPA thu ei indawn theina ding chu a la um a, amiruokchu, ama chu ka theidaa, ka chungthua hin thu a hril ṭha ngai hrim hrim nawh a, thil ṭha naw chau naw chu; chu mi chu Imla naupa Mikaia a nih,” a ta. Jehosaphat chun, “Lal chun chuong chun ti naw phawt raw se,” a ta."
8,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.","Chun, Israel lal chun hotu pakhat a ko a, “Imla naupa Mikaia chu inhmâwtakin hung ṭhuoi rawh,” a ta."
9,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.","Chun, Israel ram lal le Juda ram lal Jehosaphat chu, an lal puona inthuomin an lal ṭhungpha ve vea chun an ṭhung a; Samaria lûtna dai kawtkhâr bula tuollaia chun an ṭhung a, chuongchun, zâwlneihai po po chun an hmaa chun thu an hril ruol duol duol a."
10,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.","Chun, Kenaan naupa Zedekia chun thîrin saki ân siem fâwm a, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Suk- bohmang an ni vawng hmakhat chu hienghai le hin Suria mihai chu i sik ding a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
11,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.","Chuongchun, zâwlneihai po po chun, chuong ang seng chun an hril tah a, “Ramoth-gileada chun hang fe la, hang hlawtling rawh, LALPA chun lal kuta chun a pêk suok ngei ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
12,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.","Chun, thangko Mikaia ko ding- a fe khan a kuomah thu a hril a, “Ngai ta, thu bau khat angin zâwl- neihai thu chun lal ta dinga ṭha chu an hril seng a; chuleiin, ka hni che hi, nanga thu khawm chu anni hril ang bawk chu ni sienla, thu ṭha hril rawh,” tiin."
13,"And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak.","Mikaia chun, “LALPA chu a hring zing a, ka Pathienin a hril chu, chu chu ngei chu hril ka tih,” a ta."
14,"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.","Chun, lal kuom a hung tlung chun lal chun a kuomah, “Mikaia, Ramoth-gileada chun indo dingin kan hang fe ding am, annawleh ka tosan el ding?” a ta. Ama chun, “Hang fe la, hang hlawtling rawh, i kutah pêk suok an ni ding a nih,” a ta."
15,"And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?","Chun, lal chun a kuoma, “LALPA hmingin thudik chau naw chu iengkhawm ka kâwlah i hril ngai nawh ti hi vawi iengzât rau am ka sukdetpui ding che a na?” a ta."
16,"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.","Ama chun, “Israel mihai po po chu, berâm a vêngtu boa, an invâk hmang angin tlângahai chun indarin ka hmuh a; chun, LALPA chun, ‘Hienghai hin vêngtu an nei nawh a, mi tin chu mâni in sengah thla- muongtakin inkîrtir seng ro,’ a tih,” tiin."
17,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?","Chun, Israel ram lal chun Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Keima chungthua chun a se tieng chau naw chu a ṭha tieng chun thu hril naw ni ti ka hril hrim che a ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
18,"And Micaiah said, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.","Chun, Mikaia chun a hril a, “Chuleichun, LALPA thu chu ngai rawh. LALPA chu a lalṭhungphaa chun ṭhung a, vân sipaihai po po chu a changtieng le a vawitienga ngîr ka hmu a nih."
19,"And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.","Chun, LALPA chun, ‘Israel ram lal Ahab chu Ramoth-gileada chun a hang fe a, chutaka chun a hang thi theina dingin tuin am thlêm a ta?’ a ta. Chun, mi pakhat chun chuong ang chun a hril a, mi dang khawmin chuong ang bawk chun an hung hril pei a."
20,"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith?","Chun, thlarau pakhat chu a hung suok a, LALPA hmaa chun a ngîr a, ‘Keiin hang thlêm ka tih,’ a ta. Chun, LALPA chun, ‘Iengtinam ie?’ a ta."
21,"And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.","Ama chun, ‘Hang fêng ka ta, a zâwlnei po pohai baua chun thlarau inkhêl hang nîng ka tih,’ a ta. Chun, ama chun, ‘Ama chu thlêm ngei i ta, hlaw khawm hang hlawtling ngei i tih; fe suok la, chuong ang tak chun hang thaw rawh,’ a ta."
22,"Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.","Chuleiin, tuhin ngai ta, hieng i zâwlneihai baua hin khêl hrilna thla- rau a sie tah a; chuleichun, LALPA chun i chungthua chun thil ṭha naw chu a hril tah a nih,” tiin."
23,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?","Chun, Kenaan naupa Zedekia chu a hung hnai a, “Keimaa inthawk- in i kuoma thu hril dingin LALPA thlarau chu khaw tieng am a fe leh?” tiin, Mikaia chu a bienga chun a ben tah a."
24,"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.","Chun, Mikaia chun, “Ngai ta, pindan sûngrila inbihmang dinga i fe pha, chu ni ngei chun la hrieng i tih,” a ta."
25,"And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;","Chun, Israel lal chun, “Mikaia hi man unla, khawpui enkawltu Amon kuoma chun ṭhuoi nâwk ro; lal naupa Joas kuoma le chun;"
26,"and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.","chun, ‘Hi mipa hi lunginah sie unla, thlamuongtaka ka hung nâwk hmakhat chun rimsikna tui le rim- sikna beiin ama hi châwm ro,’ lalin a tih, ti ro,” a ta."
27,"And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.","Chun, Mikaia chun, “Thla- muongtaka i hung nâwk hrim hrim chun, LALPAIN kei mi hmangin thu a hril naw nîng a tih,” a ta. Chun, “Mipuihai, nangni po poin lo hre ta u,” a ta."
28,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.,"Chuongchun, Israel ram lal le Juda ram lal Jehosaphat chu Ramoth- gileada chun an hang fe tah a."
29,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.","Chun, Israel lal chun Jehosa- phat kuoma chun, “Insukdanglam ka ta, indonaah hang fêng ka tih; amiruokchu, nang chu i lal puon sil zing la,” a ta. Chuongchun, Israel lal chu ân sukdanglam a, indonaa chun an hang fe tah a."
30,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.","Chun, Suria lal chun sakawr tawlailîrhai hotuhai kuoma chun, “Israel lal ngat naw chu mi lien amanih, mi chîn amani khawm chu va do naw ro,” tiin thu a pêk a."
31,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.","Chun, sakawr tawlailîr hotuhai chun Jehosaphat chu an hmu chun, “Israel lal a nih a,” an ta. Chuleiin, ama chu do dingin an inhuol tah a; amiruokchu, Jehosaphat chu a khêk a, LALPA chun ama chu a ṭhangpui tah a; chuongchun, amaa inthawka inkieng dingin Pathien chun a hung thaw tah a."
32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.","Chun, sakawr tawlailîr hotuhai chun Israel lal a ni nawh ti an hmu chun, ama an hnawt lai chu an kîrsan tah a."
33,"And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.","Chun, mi tuin amanih tum bîk nei loin a thalngul chu a kuoi a, Israel lal chu a râlthuom inzawmna kâr taka chun a kâp tah a; chuleichun, a tawlailîr khaltu kuoma chun, “Kei her la, sipaihai laia inthawk hi mi fe suokpui raw khai, ka hliem nasa êm el,” a ta."
34,And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.,"Chu ni chun indona chu a zuol pei a, ngai ta, Israel lal chu Suriahai chu doin a tawlailîra chun zântieng chenin a ṭhang zing a; chun, ama chu nisa tlâk hun lai taka hin a thi tah a."
