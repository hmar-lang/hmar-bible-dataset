1,"And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.","Rehoboam ram chu sukdet a hung na, a hung hrât phing chun, LALPA dân chu a nghatsan tah a, Israelhai po po khawm chun ama an zui veh a."
2,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,","Chun, Rehoboam inlal kum nganaa chun Aigupta rama lal Sisak chun Jerusalem a hung rûn a, LALPA chungah an lo bawsiet ta leiin;"
3,"with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.","sakawr tawlailîr sâng le za hni le sakawr chung chuong mi sîng ruk leh; Aigupta rama inthawka ama hung zuitu Lubim mihai, Sukkiim mihai, Ethiopia mihai le chu tiem sêng ruol lo an nih."
4,"And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.","Chun, Judai rama khawpui kul neihai chu a lâk a, chuongchun, Jerusalema chun a hung pei a."
5,"Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.","Chun, zâwlnei Semaia chu Rehoboam le hotu, Judai ram Sisak leia Jerusalema hung khâwmhai kuoma chun a hung a, an kuoma chun, “LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Kei in mi nghatsan tah, kei khawma Sisak kutah ka mâksan ding cheu a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
6,"Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.","Chun, lal tak le Israel upahai chu an insukhnuoi a, “LALPA chu a fel a nih,” an tih a."
7,"And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.","LALPA chun anni chu an insuk- hnuoi ti a hmu phing chun, Semaia kuoma chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung tah a, “Anni le anni chu an insukhnuoi a, anni chu sukbohmang vawng naw ning a, amiruokchu, ṭhenkhat sansuokna chu phalpêk ka ta, Sisak kuta hin, Jerusalem chunga ka lungsenna chu bunthlâk ni naw ni."
8,"Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.","Amiruokchu, a siehlawhai hung nîng an ta, hieng ramhaia lalram rawngbâwlna le ka rawngbâwlna chu an hriet theina dingin,” tiin."
9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.","Chuongchun, Aigupta lal Sisak chun Jerusalem chu a hung rûn a, lal in rothilhai le LALPA in rothilhai chu a lâk hmang a; chuong chu a lâk hmang vawng a, Solomonin rângka- chak phaw a siemhai khawm kha a lâk hmang vawng a."
10,"And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king’s house.","Chun, lal Rehoboam chun chuong aia chun dârsen phâwhai a siem a, lal in kawtkhâr vêngtu, vêng- tu pâwl hotu kuoma chun ân kawl- tir a."
11,"And it was so, that, as oft as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.","LALPA ina chun lal chu a lût po leh, vêngtu chu a hung a, chuong phâwhai chu a chawi hlak a; chun, vêngtu pindana chun a sie kîr nâwk hlak a nih."
12,"And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things found.","Chun, ama chu ân sukhnuoi tâk lei chun LALPA lunginsenna chu ama sukbohmang let dêr lo dingin lâk- kieng a lo ni tah a; chunawa khawm, Judai ram chu a la ṭha zing bawk a."
13,"So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.","Chuongchun, lal Rehoboam chu Jerusalema chun ân sukdet a, ro a rêl tah a, ro a rêl ṭan tir chun Rehoboam chu kum sâwmli le kum khat a ni tah a, chun, Jerusalemah, Israel hnam po po laia inthawka a hming um zingna dinga LALPAIN a thlang suok khaw- puia chun kum sâwmpasari a rêl bawk a; a nu hming chu Ammon mi Naama a nih."
14,"And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.",LALPA chu zawng dinga a lungril a hmang naw leiin thil ṭha naw chu a thaw tah a.
15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.","Chuongchun, Rehoboam thil- thawhai, a hmasa le nuhnunghai khawm, thla thu sui dân ang peiin zâwlnei Iddo le zâwlnei Semaia chanchinbuhaia chun ziek an ni naw am a nih? Chun, Rehoboam le Jero- boam inkâra hin indonahai a um zing zing bawk a."
16,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Rehoboam chu a thla- tuhai kuomah a in tah a, David khawpuia chun phûmin a um a; chun, a naupa Abija chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
