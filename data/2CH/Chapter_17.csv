1,"And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.","A naupa Jehosaphat chun ama aia chun ro a hung rêl a, Israel chunga chun do dingin ân sukdet hle tah a."
2,"And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.","Juda rama khawpui kul neihai taphawta chun sipaihai a sieh a, Juda rama le Ephraim rama khawpui a pa Asain a lo lâk tahaia khan sipai pâwl lienhai chu a sie bawk a."
3,"And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baalim,","Chun, LALPA chu Jehosaphat kuoma chun a um a, a thlatu David lampui hmasahai chu a hraw lei le Baal chu zawng loa,"
4,"but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.","a thlatuhai Pathien chu zawnga, a thupêkhai chu Israel mihai thaw ang ni loa, a zâwm leiin."
5,Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.,"Chuleiin, LALPA chun a kuta chun ram chu a tungding a; Juda ram po po chun Jehosaphat kuoma chun thilpêkhai an hung chawi a; chuongchun, hausaknahai le inzâkaina chu nasatakin a nei tah a."
6,And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.,"Chun, LALPA kawngahai chun a lungril chu a thle a; chu nawa khawm Juda rama Asera le bâwlhmunhai po po chu a lâk hmang a."
7,"Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;","Chun, ân lal a kum thum kuma chun a hotuhai Benhail, Obadia, Zekaria, Nethanel le Mikaia chu Juda ram khawpuihaia inchûktir dingin a tir tâwl a;"
8,"and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.","anni lai chun Levi mi Semaia, Nethania, Zebadia, Asahel, Semira- moth, Jehonathan, Adonija, Tobija, Tob-adonija le Levi mihai chu an ṭhang a; anni laia chun thiempu Elisama le Jehoram chu an ṭhang ve bawk a."
9,"And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.","LALPA dân lekhabu chu chawiin, Juda rama chun an inchûktir tah a; chuongchun, Juda ram khawpuiahai po po chun an fe lâwn a, mipuihai chu an inchûktir tah a."
10,"And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.","Chun, Judai ram vêla ramhaia lalram po poahai chun LALPA ṭina chu a um tah a; chuongchun, Jeho- saphat chu an do ngam nawh a."
11,"And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.","Chun, Philistin mi ṭhenkhathai chu Jehosaphat kuoma chun thil- pêkhai le, siechawi dingin tangkaruo an hung pêk a; chun, Arabia mihai khawma ran ruol, berâmchal sâng sari le za sari le, kêlchal sâng sari le za sari an hung kei a."
12,And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.,"Chuongchun, Jehosaphat chu nasatakin a hung lien tah a; Juda rama chun kulhai le siekhâwmna khawpuihai a siem tah a."
13,"And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.","Juda rama khuohaia chun sin tamtak el a nei a, chun, Jerusalema chun indo mi, mi hrât khawkhênghai a nei bawk a."
14,"And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;","Chun, hi hi an pahnam ang peia intiemna chu a nih: Juda hnama chun sâng chunga hotuhai chu: hotu Adna, ama hnuoia chun mi hrât ṭhieu nuoi thum an um a;"
15,"and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand;","ama dawta chun hotu Jeho- hanan, ama hnuoia chun nuoi hni le sîng riet an um a;"
16,"and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.","ama dawta chun Zikri naupa Amasia, LALPA kuoma inphaltaka inpetu chu; ama hnuoia chun mi hrât khawkhêng nuoi hni an um bawk a;"
17,"And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;","Benjamin hnama mi chu: mi hrât khawkhêng Eliada, ama hnuoia chun mi phâw le thalngula inthuom nuoi hni an um a;"
18,"and next to him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war.","chun, ama dawta chun Jeho- zabad a na, ama hnuoia chun indo dinga inpeisa mi nuoi khat le sîng riet an um bawk a."
19,"These were they that waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.",Juda ram po poa khawpui kul neihai lalin a siehai ti loa chun hienghai hi lal vêngtuhai chu an nih.
