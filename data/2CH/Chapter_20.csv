1,"And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.","Hi hnunga Moab thlahai le Ammon thlahai chu, Meunim mi ṭhenkhathai le chun Jehosaphat chu do dingin an hung thaw tah a."
2,"Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi).","Chun, mi tuhai amanih an hung a, Jehosaphat kuoma chun, “Suria rama tuipui râla inthawkin mipui nasatak nangma rûn ding chein an hung a, ngai ta, Hazazon-tamarah an um,” tiin an hril a, (chu chu Engedi leh angkhat a nih)."
3,"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto Jehovah; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.","Chuongchun, Jehosaphat chu a ṭi tah a; LALPA chu a zawng a, Juda ram po poa bunghei a rawt tah a."
4,"And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.","Chun, Juda mihai chu LALPA ṭhangpuina zawng dingin an in- khâwm a; Juda ram khawpui po poa inthawkin LALPA chu zawng dingin an hung tâwl a."
5,"And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;","Jehosaphat chu LALPA inah, tuollai thar hmaa Juda le Jerusalem mipui pungkhâwmhai laia chun a ngîr a;"
6,"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and art not thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee.","A hril a, “Aw LALPA, kan thlatu- hai Pathien, nang chu vân Pathien i ni naw am a nih? Hnamhai lalram po pohai chunga rorêltu chu nang i ni naw am a nih? I kuta chun hrâtna le thilthawtheina a um a, chuleiin, tukhawma dang thei naw ni hai che."
7,"Didst not thou, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?","Aw kan Pathien, i mi Israelhai hmaah hi ram hluotuhai hi i hnawt suokin, i ruolpa Abraham thlahai kuomah kumkhuoa dingin i pêk a ni naw am a nih?"
8,"And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,","Chuongchun, chutaka chun an um a, i ta dingin i hmingin hmun inthieng chutaka chun an bâwlpêk che a,"
9,"If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee (for thy name is in this house), and cry unto thee in our affliction, and thou wilt hear and save.","‘Thil ṭha naw dâm, kâwlhnâm dâm, rorêlna dâm, hri amanih, ṭâm amanih kan chungah a hung tlung chun nangma hmaa le hi in hmaa hin ngîr kan ta, (i hming chu hi ina hin a um sih a,) kan rimsiknaa chun nang hung ko kan ti cheh a, nang chun mi lo sandam i tih,’ tiin."
10,"And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not;","Tuhin, ngai ta, Ammon le Moab thlahai le Seir tlâng Aigupta rama inthawka an hung suok laia nangin Israel mihai inrûntir lo le, insuk- siettir lo a i în umtirhai khan,"
11,"behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.","ngai ta, nangin hluo dinga i mi pêk, i chana inthawka hunga mi hnawt suok dinga an mi hung thaw- zie hi lo hre la."
12,"O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.","Aw kan Pathien, nangin an chungah ro i rêl ding a ni naw am a nih? Hieng keini mi hung thaw tum pâwl nasatak el chunga hin hrâtna kan nei si nawh a; ieng am thaw ding a na ti khawm kan hriet bawk nawh; nangma tieng kan hung ngha a nih,” tiin."
13,"And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.","Chuongchun, Juda mihai po po chu LALPA hmaa chun an nauhai leh an nuhmeihai le an nautêhai rawi le chun an ngîr a."
14,"Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly;","Chun, Asaph naupasalhai Levi mi, Mattania naupa, Jeiel naupa, Benaia naupa, Zekaria naupa, Jaha- ziel chunga chun mipui inkhâwmhai laia chun LALPA thlarau a hung tlung a;"
15,"and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: Thus saith Jehovah unto you, Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.","ama chun a hril a, “Nangni Juda mi po pohai, Jerusalem hluotu po pohai le nang lal Jehosaphat, lo ngai ta u, LALPA chun hieng ang hin in kuomah a ti a nih, ‘Hi mipui tamtak lei hin beidawng naw unla, ṭit khawm ṭi bawk naw ro; indona chu in ta a ni nawh a, Pathien ta a ni lem sih a."
16,"To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.","Zînga hin anni chu zuk thaw unla, ngai ta u, Ziz lam tunga khan an hung a nih; Jeruel thlalêr tlung hmaa phairuom tâwpa khan anni chu hmûng in tih."
17,"Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed: to-morrow go out against them; for Jehovah is with you.","Hi indonaa hin in do ngai kher naw nih, intlar phawt unla, ngîr ṭawk ṭawk ro; LALPA sandamna chu en zing el ro; aw Juda mihai le Jerusalem mihai, ṭi naw unla, beidawng bawk naw ro; zingah anni chu hang thaw unla, LALPA chu in kuomah a um sih a,’” tiin."
18,"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah.","Chun, Jehosaphat chu a hmaia hnuoi sikin a lu a kûn a, chun, Juda mi po po le Jerusalema chêngtuhai chu LALPA hmaa chun an bawkkhup a, LALPA chibai an bûk a."
19,"And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.","Chun, Kohath thlahai le Kora thla Levi mihai chu râwl nasataka inringa Israel Pathien LALPA chu inpâk dingin an ngir tah a."
20,"And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.","Chun, zîngkâr inhmatakin an tho a, Tekoa thlalêra chun an hang feh a, chun, chuonga an fe suok lai chun Jehosaphat chu a ngîr a, “Aw Juda le Jerusalema chêngtuhai, mi lo ngai ta u; LALPA in Pathien chu ring unla, chuongchun, sukdetin um in tih; a zâwlneihai chu ring unla, chuongchun, hlawtling in tih,” a ta."
21,"And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing unto Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.","Chun, mipuihai chu ân fui zo hnung chun, sipaihai hmaa an fe suok phaa inthieng mawina chu inpâka LALPA kuoma hla sak dingin mi a ruot a: “LALPA kuomah lâwmthu hril ro, a zângaina chu kumkhuoin a um zing sih a, ti ro” a ta."
22,"And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten.","Chun, an inpâk a, hla an hang sak ṭan phing chun Juda ram hung rûntuhai Seir tlâng le, Moab le Ammon thlahai chunga chun inchân rutuhai LALPA chun ân chân tir tah a; chuongchun, hnein an um tah a."
23,"For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.","Moab le Ammon thlahai chu Seir tlâng khuo deltuhai chu that vawng a, anni sukbohmang dingin an hung tho tah a; chun, Seir tlâng hluotuhai an hung sukrêm hnunga khawm chun, mi tin chu mi dang dang insukbohmangtuo an tum seng tah a."
24,"And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped.","Chun, Juda mihai chu thlalêra vêngna in insânga an hang tlung chun; mipuihai chu an hei en a; chun, ngai ta, mithi ruong hnuoia tluhai chu an hmu a; tukhawm a damsuok hrim an um dêr nawh a."
25,"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.","Chun, Jehosaphat le a mihai chu an thuom hlîppêk dinga an hung chun lunghluhai, silfênhai, hausakna nasatak elhai chu anni lai chun an hmusuok a, chuonghai chu an phur sêng lo rauin an lâk a; chuong ang lâwm chun a tam a, ni thum sûng zet chu râllâk thilhai chu an lâk a."
26,And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah unto this day.,"Chun, a ni li ni chun anni chu Beraka ruoma chun an inkhâwm a, chutaka chun LALPA chu an chawi- mawi a, chuleiin, a hmun hming chu tu chen hin “Malsâwmna ruom” ti a ni tah a."
27,"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.","Chun, Juda rama mi po po le Jerusalema mihai chu an kîr nâwk tah a; Jehosaphat chu anni rawi hmaa chun hlimtakin Jerusalema fe ding chun a kîr tah a; LALPA chun an hmêlmahai chunga hlim dingin anni chu a lo siem ta sih a."
28,And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of Jehovah.,"Chun, Jerusalema chun LALPA inah perkhuonghai, ṭingṭanghai, taw- tawrâwthai leh an hung lût a."
29,"And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.","Chun, Israelhai hmêlmahai chu LALPA chun a dopui ti an hriet chun chuong ramhaia lalramhai po po chunga chun LALPA ṭina chu a um a."
30,So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about.,"Chuongchun, Jehosaphat ram huop sûng chu a re ṭawk ṭawk a; a Pathien chun a vêl po poa chun râl- muongna a pêk sih a."
31,And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.,"Jehosaphat chun Juda ram chunga chun ro a rêl a, a rorêl ṭan chun kum sâwmthum panga a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmhni panga a rêl a; a nu hming chu Azuba, Silhi naunu kha a nih."
32,"And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah.","A pa Asa lampui kha a hraw a, LALPA mithmua ân dik chu thawin a pêtsan ngai nawh a."
33,Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of their fathers.,"Amiruokchu, bâwlhmunhai chu lâk hmang a ni nawh a; mihai khawm chun an thlatuhai Pathien tienga chun an lungrilhai an lân nghat chie nawh a."
34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.","Jehosaphat thilthaw, a hmasa le a nuhnunghai chu, ngai ta, Hanani naupa Jehu chanchin bu, Israel lalhai lekhabua chun ziek a nih."
35,And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly:,"Chun, hi hnunga hin Juda ram lal Jehosaphat chu Israel ram lal Ahazia le chun an inzawm a; ama chun khawhlotakin a thawh a;"
36,and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.,"lawnghai siema, Tarsisa fe dingin ama chu ân zawmpui a; chuong chun, Ezion-gebera chun lawnghai chu an siem tah a."
37,"Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath destroyed thy works. And the ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.","Chun, Maresaa Dodavahu naupa Eliezer chun Jehosaphat chunga chun a hrillâwk a, “Ahazia chu în zawmpui leiin, LALPA chun i sinthawhai chu a suksiet tah,” a ta. Chuongchun, lawnghai chu an kawiseh a, Tarsisa chun an fe thei ta nawh a."
