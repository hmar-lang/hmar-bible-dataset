1,"And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.","Chun, Juda mihai po po chun Uzzia chu an ṭhuoi a, ama chu kum sâwm paruka upa a na, a pa Amazia hmuna chun lalah an siem tah a."
2,"He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.","Eloth chu a bâwl a, Juda rama chun a pêk nâwk a; chu hnunga chun lal chu a thlatuhai lai chun a in ve tah a."
3,"Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.","Uzzia chun ro a rêl ṭan chun kum sâwmparuka upa a na; Jerusalema chun kum sâwmnga pahni sûng ro a rêl a, a nu hming khawm Jerusalema mi Jekolia a nih."
4,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.",Ama khawm chun a pa Amazia lo thaw ta ang tak khan LALPA mithmuah thil indik chu a thawh a.
5,"And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.","Pathiena thil hmulâwk hriet- thiemna nei Zekaria dam sûng po chun Pathien chu zawng dingin ân siem a; LALPA chu a zawng sûng po chu, Pathien chun ân hlawtlingtir bawk a."
6,"And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines.","Chun, a fe suok a, Philistin mihai ân dopui a; Gath kul le, Jabne kul le Asdod kul chu a suk- siet a; chun, Philistin mihai laia le Asdod biela chun khuohai a siem bawk a."
7,"And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim.","Chun, Philistin mihai le Arabia mihai Gur-baal le Meunima umhai laia chun Pathien chun a ṭhangpui a."
8,And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong.,"Chuongchun, Ammon mihai chun Uzzia kuomah sie an hung chawi a, a hming chu Aigupta ram lûtna chen rauin a hung inthang tah a; a hung hrât êm êm el ta sih a."
9,"Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.","Chunawa khawm, Uzzia chun a Kil dâi Kawtkhâr bula dâm, Ruom dâi Kawtkhâra dâm, chun, kul hung kâwina hmuna dâm khan vêngna in insânghai a bâwl a, sipaihai a sie sip a."
10,"And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland also, and in the plain: and he had husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.","Thlalêra dâm khawm vêngna in insânghai a bâwl a, tuisunsuohai tamtak a cho bawk a, ran ruol tamtak a nei sih a, tlângṭhuta le phaizâwla dâm khawm chun; lo hmun ṭhahai le tlâng rama dâm chun huon puhai le grêp hrui enkawltuhai a nei a, huon siem vêl hi a châk zâwngtak a ni sih a."
11,"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.","Chunawa khawm Uzzia chun indo mi, sipai pâwl, Hanania kut hnuoi, hotu Maaseia le lekhaziektu Jeielin anni tiema an nizât ang peia, a pâwl peia indoa fe suok hlakhai chu a nei bawk a."
12,"The whole number of the heads of fathers’ houses, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.","Pahnamhai laia ṭhuoituhai, mi hrât khawkhênghai an rênga an nizât chu sâng hni le za ruk an nih."
13,"And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.","Anni kut hnuoi a chun sipai inchûkthiem sa, hmêlma chunga lal chu ṭhangpui dinga, thilthawtheina nasatak le va do thei mihai chu nuoi thum, sâng sari le za nga an nih."
14,"And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.","Chun, Uzzia chun an ta dingin, sipai po pohai ta ding chun, phâwhai, feihai, thîr lukhumhai, indona zakuo- hai, thalngulhai, dêngvira dinga lunghai leh a siemrêl vawng a."
15,"And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.","Jerusalema chun mi them- thiemhai hmusuokin, khâwl lihai, vêngna in insânghaia um ding le, a kia vêngna in insânga ding chun, lunghai le thalhai chu kâp thei dingin, a siem bawk a. Chuongchun, a hming chu nasatakin ân dar a, a suksuol hma po khan chu maktaka ṭhangpuiin a um sih a."
16,"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.","Nisienlakhawm, a hung hrât chun, a lungril a hung uong a, khawhlotakin a thaw tah a, a Pathien LALPA chunga chun a bawsiet tah a; riminhnik rawna mâichâm chunga riminhnik raw dingin LALPA biek ina chun a fe ve ta a."
17,"And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:","Ama hnunga chun thiempu Azaria chu, LALPA thiempu sâwm- riet, mi thil thawtheitak takhai le chun a va lût veh a;"
18,"and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God.","lal Uzzia chu an sawisêl a, a kuoma chun, “Uzzia, LALPA kuoma riminhnik raw hi nanga chan a ni nawh a, Aron naupasalhai thiem- puhai, riminhnik raw dinga suk- thienga umhai chan a ni lem; hmun inthienga inthawk hin fe suok rawh; i bawsiet a ni ta sih a; LALPA Pathiena inthawka inza i kaina khawm ni chuong bawk naw nih,” an ta."
19,"Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.","Uzzia chu a lunginsen a; rimin- hnik chu raw dingin riminhnik râwna mei lâkna chu a kuta chun a um zing a; chun, thiempuhai chunga a lungin- sen lai chun, riminhnik râwna mâichâm sîra, LALPA ina thiempu- hai hmaa chun a bâwka hin inphârna hri a hung suok tah a."
20,"And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.","Chun, thiempu laltak Azaria le thiempu danghai po po chun ama chu an en zing a, chun, ngai ta, a bâwka chun a hung inphâr tah a, chutaka inthawk chun inrangtakin an hnawt- suok tah a; anih, LALPA chun ama chu a hrem tâk lei chun ama ngei khawm chun fe suok chu ân hmaw tah a."
21,"And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.","Chuongchun, lal Uzzia chu a thi ni chen chun inphâr a ni tah a; in hranah a um a, inphâr a na; LALPA ina inthawk chun sât thlâk a ni ta sih a; a naupa Jotham chu lal in enkawl- tu, ram sûnga mipuihai rorêltu a hung ni tah a."
22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.","Chun, Uzzia thilthaw, a hmasa le a nuhnunghai khawm Amoz naupa Zâwlnei Isai chun a ziek a."
23,"So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.","Chuongchun, Uzzia chu a thla- tuhai laia chun a in tah a; inphûmna thlân muol lalhai taa chun a thla- tuhai lai chun an phûm tah a, “Inphâr a ni annâwm,” an ti sih a; chun, a naupa Jotham chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
