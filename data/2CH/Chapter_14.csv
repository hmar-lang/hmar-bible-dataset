1,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.","Chuongchun, Abija chu a thlatuhai kuoma chun a in tah a, ama chu David khawpuia chun an phûm a, a naupa Asa chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a; ama inlal sûng chun kum sâwm sûng chu ram chu râlmuongin a um a."
2,And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:,"Chun, Asa chun a Pathien, LALPA mithmuah thil indik le ṭhahai chu a thawh a;"
3,"for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,","bâwlhmunhai le mâichâm dang- lamhai chu a lâk hmang a, lungphun- hai chu a sukthliek a, Asera chu a phûr thlûk bawk a;"
4,"and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.","chun, Juda mihai chu an thla- tuhai Pathien LALPA chu zawnga thupêk le dânhai chu thaw pei dingin thu a pêk bawk a."
5,Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.,Juda ram sûng khawpui po pohaia inthawk chun bâwlhmunhai le nisa limhai chu a lâk hmang vawng a; ram chu ama hmaa chun a re ṭawk ṭawk a.
6,"And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.","Juda rama chun khawpui kul neihai chu a bâwl a, LALPAIN ama chu châwlna a pêk leiin, ram chu a re ṭawk ṭawk a, chuong kumahai chun indona a nei si nawh a."
7,"For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.","Chun, ama chun, Juda mihai kuoma chun, “Hieng khawpuihai hi bâwl ei tiu a, a banghai, a kulbîng insânghai, a dai kawtkhârhai le a kalna thîrhai siem ei tiu; ei Pathien LALPA chu ei zawng leiin ram chu ei hnuoiah a um a nih; ama chu ei zawng leiin kil tinah ama chun châwl a mi pêk a ni hi,” a ta. Chuongchun, an bâwl a, hlaw khawm an hlawtling pei tah a."
8,"And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.","Chun, Asa chun Juda hnama inthawkin âwmphâw le fei chawi mi sipai nuoi thum a nei a; Benjamin hnama inthawkin phaw chawia thal- ngul kuoi mi nuoi hni le sîng riet a nei bawk a: hieng mihai po po hi mi hrât khawkhêng ruok an nih."
9,"And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.","Chun, Ethiopia mi Zera chun sipai maktaduoi khat le sakawr tawlailîr za thum leh anni chu a hung thawh a; ama chu Maresa chenin a hung a."
10,"Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.","Chun, Asa chu ama tuok ding chun a suok a, Maresaa Zephatha ruoma chun indo ding chun an inep tah a."
11,"And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.","Asa chu a Pathien LALPA kuoma chun a khêk a, “LALPA chau naw chu, hrâtna nei lo mihai ta dinga, mi thilthawtheia inthawka ṭhangpui ding mi dang tukhawm an um nawh a; Aw LALPA kan Pathien, mi ṭhang- pui la; nangmaah kan innghat sih a, hi mipui hi i hming leiin kan hung do a ni hi. Aw LALPA nang chu kan Pathien i na, nangma chu tukhawma hne naw raw se che,” tiin."
12,"So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Asa hmaa le Juda mihai hmaa chun Ethiopia mihai chu a hung thawh a; Ethiopia mihai chu an tlânse tah a."
13,"And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.","Asa le a kuoma mipui umhai chun anni chu Gerar chenin an hnawt a; Ethiopia mihai chu nasatakin an thi a, ṭhang an khaw thei ta nawh a; LALPA le a sipaihai hmaa chun sukbohmangin an um a; anni chun râllâk sum tamtak an lâk a."
14,And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.,"Chun, Gerar vêla khuohai po po chu a thaw vawng a, LALPA ṭitna chu an chunga chun a hung tlung tâwl sih a, khawpuihai po po chu an suksiet a, chuonga hai chun râllâk thil tam- takhai chu a um sih a."
15,"They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.","Ran ruol bûkhai chu an rûn pei a, berâm tamtakhai le sanghâwngsei leh an lâk ṭeu a, Jerusalemah an kîr tah a."
