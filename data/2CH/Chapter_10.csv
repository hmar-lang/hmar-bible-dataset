1,And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.,Rehoboam chu Sekema chun a feh a; Israelhai po po chu ama chu lala siem dingin Sekema chun an hung sih a.
2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.","Chun, Nebat naupa Jeroboam chun chu chu a lo hriet chun, (Solomon hmaa inthawka a tlân- hmangna Aigupta rama chun a la um a ni sih a.) Jeroboam chu Aigupta rama inthawk chun a hung kîr tah a."
3,"And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,","Chun, mi an tir a, ama chu an ko tah a; chuongchun, Jeroboam le Israelhai po po chu an hung a, Rehoboam kuoma chun an hril a,"
4,"Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.","“I pa khan kan rîngkawl chu riktakin a lo siem tah a; chuleiin, tuhin i pa rawngbâwlna riktak le, kan chunga rîngkawl rik ân nghat hi mi sukzâng pêk la, chuongchun, i rawngbâwl kan tih,” an ta."
5,"And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.","Anni kuoma chun, “Ni thum hnungah ka kuomah hung nâwk ro,” a lo tih a, chuongchun, mipui chu an fe tah a."
6,"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?","Chun, Rehoboam chun mi upa- hai, a pa Solomon damlaia a hmaa ngîr hlakhai chu, “Hi mipuihai hi dawn kirna dingin ieng thurâwn am in mi pêk a,” tiin, a râwn a."
7,"And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Hi mipui chunga hin za i ngai a, anni hi i suklungawi a, an kuomah thu ṭha i hril chun kumkhuoin i siehlawhai nîng an tih,” an ta."
8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.","Nisienlakhawm, upahai thurâwn ama an pêk ta chu a nghatsan a, ama hmaa ngîr hlak, ama ruolpuihai tlangvâlhai chu a rawn tah a."
9,"And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?","An kuoma chun, “Hieng mipui, ‘I pain kan chunga rîngkawl a innghat hi mi sukzângpêk rawh,’ tituhai hi ieng dawnna am ei inkîr thei ding ieng am thurâwn in nei a?” a ta."
10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.","Tlangvâlhai, ama ruolpuihai chun an hril a, a kuomah, “ ‘I pain kan rîngkawl a sukrik êm a, nangin keini mi sukzângpêk rawh,’ i kuoma tituhai mipui kuoma chun hieng ang hin ti la, hieng ang hin an kuoma chun hril rawh, ‘Ka kutte chu ka pa kâwng- bâwr nêkin a lien lem a."
11,"And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.","Tuhin ka pain rîngkawl rik a lo inphurtir ta cheu a; kei chun in rîng- kawl chu belsâng ka tih; ka pain vuoknain a lo hrem cheu a ni chun, kei chun ainuvêtin hrem ka ti cheu,’ tiin,” an tih a."
12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.","Chuongchun, Jeroboam le mi- puihai po po chu ni thum ni chun lalin, Ni thum niah ka kuomah hung nâwk ro, tia a lo inthla ang khan a kuomah an hung tah a."
13,"And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,","Lal chun vîntakin a lo dawn a; lal Rehoboam chun mi upahai thurâwn chu a nghatsan a,"
14,"and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.","tlangvâlhai thurâwn angin, “Ka pa chun in rîngkawl chu a lo sukrik hle tah a, keiin chu chu belsâng ka ta; ka pain vuoknain a lo hrem cheu a ni chun, kei chun chu ainuvêtin hrem ka ti cheu,” tiin a lo hril a."
15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","Chuongchun, lal chun mipuihai thu chu a ngai nawh a; Silon mi Ahija hmanga Nebat naupa Jeroboam kuoma a thu lo hril tah, a thu chu LALPAIN ân tlungtir theina ding- in, Pathienin a hung intlungtir a ni sih a."
16,"And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed unto their tents.","Chuonga Israel po po chun lal chun an thu a ngai nawh ti an hriet chun mipuihai chun an dawn a, “David a hin chanvo ieng am ei nei hrim luoh a? Jesai naupaa hin rochan ieng khawm ei nei bawk nawh; mi tin mâni puon in sengah fe ro, Aw Israel- hai: David, tuhin nangma insûng ngei chu inngaituo ta,” tiin."
17,"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.","Chuongchun, Israelhai po po chu an puon inhaia chun an ṭin tâwl tah a. Amiruokchu, Judai ram khaw- puihaia umhai Israel thlahai chunga khan chu Rehoboam chun ro a rêl zing a."
18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.","Chun, lal Rehoboam chun Hadoram, leiman hotu chu a tir a, Israel thlahai chun ama chu lungin an lo dêng a, a thi tah a. Chun, lal Rehoboam chu a sakawr tawlailîrah a chuong a, inhmâwtakin Jerusalemah a tlânse tah a."
19,So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.,"Chuongchun, Israel sûngkuo chu David sûngkuo chunga chun, vawisûn ni chen hin an hel tah a."
