1,"After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.","Hi ringumna le hieng thilhai thaw a ni hnunga hin Assuria lal Sennakerib chu a hung a; Juda ram a hung lût a, khawpui kulneihai chu ân huol a, ama ta dinga hne el dingin a ngaituoh a."
2,"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,","Chun, Hezekia chun Sennakerib chu a hung a, Jerusalem hung do a tum a nih ti a hriet chun,"
3,he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him.,"khawpui puotienga tuikhur tui- hai chu hrukping dingin a mi thilthawtheihai le a upahai chu a rawn tah a; chun, ama chu an ṭhangpui tah a."
4,"So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?","Chuongchun, mipui nasatak el chu an pung tah a; tuikhur po po le, ram laia tui luong vadungtêhai po po chu an hrukping ta vawng a, “Ieng- dingin am Assuria lal chu hungin, tui tamtak hung nei el a ta?” an tih a."
5,"And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall without, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.","Chun, ân sukhuoi a, kul se tahai po po chu a siem ṭha a; chutaka chun kuldâi danghai le râl vêngbûkhai chu a bâwl bawk a; chun, David khawpuia Millo chu a sukdet a, hriemhai le phawhai chu tamtakin a siem a."
6,"And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,","Chun, mipuihai chunga chun indona hotuhai chu a ruot a, khawpui dâi kawtkhâr bula hmun âwl liena chun ama kuomah a ko khâwm tâwl a; an kuoma chun thlamuongumtakin thu a hril a,"
7,"Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:","“Hrât unla, insukhuoi ro, Assuria lal lei chun ṭi naw unla, beidawng bawk naw ro; ama kuoma um mipui nasatakhai lei khawm chun, ama kuoma um nêk chun eini kuoma um chu a hrât lem sih a;"
8,"with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.","ama kuoma chun tisaa sipai pâwl an na, amiruokchu, eini kuoma chu LALPA ei Pathien chu mi ṭhangpui ding le ei indona chu do dingin a um a nih,” tiin. Chun, mipui chu Juda lal Hezekia thuhrila chun an sâwldam hle a."
9,"After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him), unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,","Hi hnunga hin Assuria lal Sen- nakerib chun Jerusalemah a siehlaw a hung tir a (ama chu Lakis tlung hma el khan a um a, a sipaihai po po khawm ama kuoma chun an um a) Juda lal Hezekia le Jerusalema Juda umhai po po kuoma chun a hung tir a."
10,"Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?","“Assuria lal Sennakerib chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Jerusalem lâk chu ieng am a na in ring nawna?"
11,"Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?","Hezekia hin, Assuria lal kuta inthawk chun LALPA ei Pathien chun mi sansuok a tih, tiin dangchâr le ṭâma inthitir el ding cheuin a thlêm- thlûk cheu a ni naw am a nih?"
12,"Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn incense?","Hi Hezekia bawk hin bâwl- hmunhai le mâichâmhai chu a lâk- hmangin, Juda ram le Jerusalema mihai chu, Mâichâm pakhat hmaa chun Pathien chibai bûk in ta, a chunga chun riminhnik khawm in raw ding a nih, tia thu pe kha?"
13,Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?,"Kei le ka thlatuhai chun ram tin, hnam tin chunga chun ieng angin am kan thaw hlaka ti in hriet naw am a nih? Hieng ramhaia hnamhai pathienhai hin ka kuta inthawkin an ram ieng kawng khawmin an sanhim thei hlak am a nih?"
14,"Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?","Ka puhaiin an lo sukbohmang letdêr ta hnamhai pathien po po lai chun tu am ka kuta inthawka a mi- hai sansuok thei ding a um a, in Pathien khawm chun ka kuta in- thawkin a sansuok theina bîk ding cheu chu?"
15,"Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?","Chuleiin, tuhin Hezekia hin hlêm naw raw se cheu, hieng ang kawng hin thlêmthlu bawk naw raw se cheu, nangni khawma ring hrim hrim naw ro; ka thlatuhai le keima kuta inthawk hin, tu ram amanih, tu hnam amani pathien chun a mihai chu a sansuok thei hrim hrim ngai si nawh a; ka kuta inthawk hin in Pathien chun a va sansuok thei âwm naw cheu deh aw!’” tiin."
16,"And his servants spake yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.","Chun, a siehlawhai chun LAL- PA Pathien chunga le a siehlaw Hezekia chunga chun hi nêk hman hin an la hril siet nasa det lem a."
17,"He wrote also letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.","Israel Pathien LALPA chu hrilse dingin lekha a ziek a, ama kal zâwnga thu hril dingin, “Ram tina hnam tin pathienhai chun ka kuta inthawk hin an mihai an sansuok ngai naw angin, Hezekia Pathien khawm hin ka kuta inthawkin a mihai chu sansuok bîk naw nih,” tiin."
18,"And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.","Chun, khawpui chu an lâk el theina dingin Jerusalema mi umhai, kula umhai chu suklâu ding le, sukbuoi dingin Juda ṭawngin râwl inringtakin an khêk khum a."
19,"And they spake of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.","Chun, Jerusalema Pathien chu hnuoia hnamhai pathienhai, mi- hriem kutsuokhai anga chun an hril a."
20,"And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.","Chun, lal Hezekia le Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai chu hi thu lei hin an ṭawngṭai a, vân tieng nghain an khêk a."
21,"And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.","Chun, LALPA chun vântirko a hung tir a, ama chun Assuria lal riebûka mi hrât khawkhênghai po po le ṭhuoituhai le hotuhai po po chu a sukhlum a. Chuongchun, hmai thûm- takin a ramah a kîr nâwk tah a. Chun, ama chu a pathien ina a hung lût laiin ama rîla rasuokhai ngei chun chutaka chun kâwlhnâmin an that tah a."
22,"Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Hezekia le Jerusalema umhai chu Assuria lal Sennakerib le mi danghai kuta inthawk chun a sanhim tah a, an vêla mihaia inthawk chun a vêng a."
23,"And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.","Chun, mi tamtak chun Jerusa- lemah LALPA kuomah thilpêkhai le, Juda lal Hezekia kuomah thil hluhai an hung chawi a; chuongchun, chutaka inthawk chun hnam po pohai mithmua chun chawimawiin a um tah a."
24,"In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death: and he prayed unto Jehovah; and he spake unto him, and gave him a sign.","Chuong lai chun Hezekia chu thi ngamin a na tah a, chun LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a; chun, ama kuoma chun thu a hung hril a, in- chikna a hung pêk a."
25,"But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chunga ditsakna thaw ang huin Hezekia chun a ngaisak nâwk ta nawh a; a lungril chu ân ngaisâng sih a; chulei- chun, ama chunga chun lunginsenna chu a um a, Jerusalem le Juda ram chunga khawm chun."
26,"Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.","Amiruokchu, Hezekia chun a lungril chapona chu ân sîr nâwk a, ân sukhnuoi a; ama le Jerusalema um- hai le chun; chuongchun, Hezekia dam sûng khan chu LALPA lungin- senna an chungah a hung tlung ta nawh a."
27,"And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;","Hezekia chun ropuina le hausakna nasatak el chu a nei a; tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, lung mantam dâm, riminhnik dâm, phaw- hai dâm, bûr le bêl ṭha tinrênghai ta dingin siekhâwmna inhai ama ta dingin a siem a;"
28,"store-houses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.","hriek le uoin le bu hung punghai dinga siekhâwmna inhai dâm, ran ruolhai ta dinga inhai le, sa chi tinrêng po po ta dinga inhai a siem bawk a."
29,"Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.","Chunawa khawm chun bâwng ruol dâm, berâm ruol dâm, khaw- puihai dâm tamtak el a nei bawk a, Pathien chun thil tamtak el ama chu a pêk sih a."
30,"This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.","Hi Hezekia bawk hin Gihon tuikhur hnâr sakhnung lem kha a hrukping a, David khawpui thlang- tieng panga khan a lâk thlâk a. Hezekia chu a sinthaw po poa chun a hlawtling pei a."
31,"Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.","Nisienlakhawm, Babulon lal- hai, chu rama thilmakhai chu indawn suok dinga a kuoma mi hungtirhai chungthua chun, a lungrila umhai po po chu a hriet theina dingin, fie dingin Pathien chun ama chu a thlathlam a."
32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","Hezekia thilthaw danghai le, a thilthaw ṭhathai chu, ngai ta, Israel le Juda lalhai lekhabua chun, Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai thil hmulâwkhaia chun ziek a nih."
33,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, Hezekia chu a thlatuhai lai a in tah a; David naupasalhai thlân in hang kainaa khan an phûm a; Juda mi po po le Jerusalema um po po chun a thi ni chun ropuitakin an râl a. Chun, a naupa Manasse chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
