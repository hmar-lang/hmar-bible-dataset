1,"And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.","Chun, vântirko a mi betu chu a hung nâwk a, mi a in lai sukhar angin a mi hung sukhar tah a."
2,"And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;","Ka kuoma chun, “Ieng am i hmu a?” a ta. Kei chun, “Rângkachak sa- thâu khâwnvar siena, a sîpa a thlêng le, chu chunga khâwnvar pasari um, khâwnvar tin chunga a dâwt pasari seng um ka hmuh,"
3,"and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.","a sîrah oliv thing pahni: thlêng changtieng panga chun pakhat, a vawitieng panga chun pakhat dang leh,” ka ta."
4,"And I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?","Chun, vântirko a mi betu chu kân dawn a, “Pu, hieng hi ieng am an na?” tiin."
5,"Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.","Chun, vântirko a mi betu chun ka kuomah, “Hieng hi ieng am an ni i hriet naw maw?” tiin a mi dawn a. Kei chun, “Aw pu, ka hriet nawh,” ka ta."
6,"Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Ama chun ka kuomah, “Hi hi Zerubbabel kuoma LALPA thu, ‘Sipai- in ni loin, thilthawtheina khawma ni loin, amiruokchu, ka thlarauin,’ tiha sipaihai LALPAIN a hril chu a nih,” a ta."
7,"Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it.","Aw tlâng lien, tu am i na? Zerubbabel hmaa chun phaizâwl hung ni el i tih, chun, ama chun a chungah, “Zângaina, zângaina,” ti khêkrihai leh lung chunghnungtak chu hung la suok a tih."
8,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chu nawa khawm LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
9,The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you.,"“Hi in lungphûm hi Zerubbabel kuthai chun a lo phûm tah a; a kuthai chun zo khawm zo ngei a tih; chun, nang chun sipaihai LALPA chun a mi hung tir a nih ti hre tâng i tih."
10,"For who hath despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; these are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.","Thil chînhai ni chu tuin am a hmusit hlak hrim a? Hlim an ta, Zerubbabel kuta chun enremna, hieng pasarihai ngei, chuong LALPA mithai ngei chu an hmu ding a ni sih a; anni chu khawvêl po po kil tin kil tanga chun an tlân vêl tah a,” tiin."
11,"Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?","Chun, keiin a kuomah, “Hieng oliv thing pahni sathâu khâwnvar siena sîr changtienga mi le vawi- tienga mi hi ieng am an nih a?” ka ta."
12,"And I answered the second time, and said unto him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden oil out of themselves?","A vawi hninaa khawm kân dawn nâwk a, a kuomah, “Rângka- chak hriek hung suokna rângkachak dâwt pahni kâwla oliv kau pahni hi ieng am an nih a?” ka ta."
13,"And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.","“Hieng hi ieng am an ni i hriet naw maw?” a ta, a mi dawn a. Kei chun, “Ka hriet nawh, ka lalpa” ka ta."
14,"Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.","Chun, ama chun, “Hieng hi hrieknâl naupasal pahnihai chu an nih, leihnuoi po po LALPA sîra ngîr hlakhai chu an nih,” a ta."
