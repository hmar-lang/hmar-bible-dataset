4,"And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.","Vântirko chun, a hmaa ngîrhai kuoma chun, “Amaa inthawkin silfên ṭawptak kha la hmang ro,” a ta.

5,"And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by.","Chun, keiin, “A lu chungah lu- kâwm mawitak inkâwmtir raw hai se,” ka ta. Chuongchun, a lua chun lukâwm mawitak chu an inkâwmtir a, ama chu silfênhai chun ân thuom a; chun, LALPA vântirko chu a kâwla chun a ngîr zing a."

7,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by.","“Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih, ka lampuihaiah i fe a, ka iphût chu i thaw bawk chun, ka insûng ro rêl i ta, ka in inhuonna tuollaihai chu vawng ṭha bawk i tih.

8,"Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.","Tuhin thiempu lal aw Josua, nang le i hmaa i rawihai ṭhung hlakhai le chun ngai ta u; inchikna dinga mihai an ni sih a; ngai ta u, a Kau, ka siehlaw chu ka hung lâk suok ding a ni sih a."
9,"For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.","En ta u, Josua hmaa chun lung pakhat sîr sari nei ka sie a; ngai ta u, chutaka chun thil ziek ker ka ta, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih, chun, ni khat sûngin chu ram suolna chu sawn hmang ka tih."
10,"In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.","Chu nia chun, theichang kûng le grêphrui hnuoia chun nangni mi tin chun mâni tuolbâwmhai chu ko tâng in tih,” sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
