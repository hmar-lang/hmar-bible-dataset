1,"And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.","Chun, ka mithai ka hang inlên nâwk a, tlâng pahni inkâra sa- kawr tawlailîr pali hung suok hi ka hmuh a, ka en zing a; chu tlânghai chu dârsen tlâng an nih."
2,In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;,Tawlailîr pakhatnaa chun sakawr senhai an um a; tawlailîr pahninaa chun sakawr dumhai an um a;
3,and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.,tawlailîr pathumnaa chun sa- kawr vârhai an um a; tawlailîr pali- naa chun sakawr rânghai an um a.
4,"Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?","Chun, vântirko a mi betu chu ka dawn a, a kuomah, “Pu, hienghai hi ieng am an na?” ka ta."
5,"And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.","Vântirko chun a mi dawn a, ka kuomah, “Hieng hi vân thlarau pali, leihnuoi po po Lalpa hmaa ngîr hlaka, fe suok hlakhai chu an nih.”"
6,The chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.,"Tawlailîr sakawr dum ihnûk chu hmâr ram tieng a fe suok hlak a; a vâr ihnûk chun a zui a; chun, a râng ihnûk chu simtieng rama chun a fe suok a."
7,"And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.","A senhai chu an fe suok a, hnuoi chung kil tin kil tanga an fe thei dân ding an zawng a; “Hitaka inthawkin suok unla hnuoi chung kil tin kil tangah fe ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, hnuoi chung kil tin kil tanga chun an fe tah a."
8,"Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.","Chun, ka kuomah a hung khêk a, “Ngai ta, hmâr tieng rama fehai khan hmâr tieng rama chun ka lungril chu an suksâwldam tah,” a ta."
9,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, Lalpa thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
10,"Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon;","“Heldai hai, Tobija hai, Jedaia hai, sala intânghaia inthawkin la la; chun, chu ni ma chun hung la, Babulona inthawka an hungna, Zephania naupa Josia ina chun fe rawh:"
11,"yea, take of them silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;","anih, tangkaruo le rângkachak lapêk la, lukhum siem la, Jehozadak naupa thiempu lal Josua lua chun bel rawh;"
12,"and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah;","chun, a kuoma chun hril la, ‘Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih: Ngai ta, mi pakhat a hming chu Kau a nih; ama chu a hmuna inthawkin hung inṭhang a ta, LALPA biekin chu hung bâwl a ta:"
13,"even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.","LALPA biekin ngei chu hung bâwl a tih; ama chun ropuina chu khum a ta, a lalṭhungphaa ṭhungin ro rêl a tih; a lalṭhungpha chunga chun thiempu nîng a ta, an pahnia inkâra chun inremna thurêl chu um a tih,’ tiin."
14,"And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah.","Chun, lallukhum chu Heldai hai, Tobija hai, Jedaia hai le Zepha- nia naupa Josia hai ta dinga, LALPA biekina hriet zingna dingin nîng a tih."
15,"And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.","Chun, ram hlataka umhai khawm chu hung an ta, LALPA biekin chu hung bâwl an ta; chun, sipaihai LALPA chun in kuomah a mi hung tir a nih ti hre tâng in tih. Hieng thilhai hi la hung tlung ngei a tih, LALPA in Pathien râwl chu nguntaka in zui phawt chun,” tiin."
