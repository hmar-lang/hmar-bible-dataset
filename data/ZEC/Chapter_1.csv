1,"In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,","Daria inlal kum hnina a thla rietnaah, Iddo naupa, Berekia naupa zâwlnei Zekaria kuomah LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:"
2,Jehovah was sore displeased with your fathers.,“In thlatuhai chunga khan LALPA chu a lungni naw êm êm a.
3,"Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Chuleiin, nangin an kuomah, LALPA chun, hieng hin a tih tiin hril rawh: Sipaihai LALPA chun, ka kuomah hung kîr ro, a tih; chuongchun, in kuomah hung kîr vêng ka tih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
4,"Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith Jehovah.","Inhmaa zâwlneihaiin an kuoma, ‘Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: in thilthaw rilohai le, in um dân khawhlonahaia inthawk khan hung kîr ro,’ a tih tia a hril a, ngai si lohai le, keia tieng khawm pawisa si lohai, in thlatuhai ang khan um naw ro, LALPA chun a tih."
5,"Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?",In thlatuhai chu khâw lai am an um tah a? Zâwlneihai khawm chu an dam zing am a nih?
6,"But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.","Amiruokchu, ka thuhai le ka thuruothai, ka siehlaw zâwlneihai thu ka ipêkhai chu, chuonghai chun in thlatuhai chu an hnawtphâk tah ni lo am a nih? Anni chu an ngha kîr a, ‘ei thilthawhai ang pei le, ei um dân ang peia sipaihai LALPAIN ei chunga thaw dinga a ngaituo angtakin, chuong angtak chun ei chungah a thaw a ni hi,’ an tih a,” tiin."
7,"Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,","Daria inlal kum hnina, thla sâwmpakhatna Sebat thla, ni sâwm- hni pali ni chun LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a:"
8,"I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.","“Zâna hin thil ka hmuh a, mi pakhat sakawr sen chunga chuong hi ka hmuh a, ama chu hmun inruom inhmui thing lai hin a ngîr zing a; chun, a hnunga chun sakawr sen dâm, a buong dâm, a vâr dâm hi an um a."
9,"Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.","Chun, keiin ‘Aw pu, hienghai hi ieng am an nih a?’ ka ta. Vântirko kei mi betu chun ka kuomah, ‘Hieng hi ieng am an ni inentir ka ti che,’ a ta."
10,"And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.","Chun, inhmui thing buk laia ngîrpa chun a dawn a, ‘Hienghai hi LALPAIN hnuoi chung kil tin kil tanga fe dinga a tirhai chu an nih,’ a ta."
11,"And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.","Chun, anni chun LALPA vântir- ko inhmui thing laia ngîr chu an dawn a, ‘Hnuoi chung kil tin kil tanga chun kan fe tah a, ngai ta, leihnuoi po po chu a ṭhung ṭawk ṭawkin, râlmuongin a um a nih,’ an ta."
12,"Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun a dawn a. ‘Aw sipaihai LALPA, kum sâwmsari sûng rau an chunga nasa- taka lunginsenna i nei, Juda khaw- puihai le Jerusalem chunga hin ieng chen am zângaina nei loin i um ding a na?’ a ta."
13,"And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me with good words, even comfortable words.","Chun, vântirko kei mi betu chu LALPA chun thu ṭhatakhai, thu thlamuongumtakhai chun a dawn tah a."
14,"So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.","Chuongchun, vântirko a mi betu chun ka kuomah, ‘Hieng ang hin khêk rawh: Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Jerusalem le Zion chu nasatakin ka thîk a nih."
15,"And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.","Chuongchun, hnam nuomsaa umhai chunga chun ka lungni naw êm êm a; lungni naw dep chu ka ni deh a, anni chun sukrinumna chu an sukzuol pei sih a, tiin,’ a ta."
16,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun a tih: ‘Zângaina leh Jerusalema chun ka hung kîr nâwk a; chutaka chun ka in chu bâwl a ni ding a nih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih; chun, Jerusalem chunga hin inkhina hmawl keimar nîng a tih."
17,"Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.","La khêk nâwk la, sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ka khawpuihai chu hausakna leiin hung inzar lien a ta; chun, LALPA chun, Zion chu la thlamuon nâwk a ta, Jerusalem chu la thlang nâwk a tih,’” tiin."
18,"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.","Chun, ka mithai ka hang inlên a, ka en a; chun, ki pali hi ka hmu a. Chun, vântirko a mi betu kuoma chun, “Hieng hi ieng am an nih a?” ka tih a."
19,"And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.","Ama chun, “Hi kihai hi Juda le Israel le Jerusalem sukdartuhai chu an nih,” tiin a mi dawn a."
20,And Jehovah showed me four smiths.,"Chun, LALPA chun thîrsu pali hi a mîn hmutir a."
21,"Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.","Chun, keiin, “Hieng hi ieng thaw dinga hung am an na?” ka tih a. Ama chun, “Hieng hi Juda sukdartu kihai chu an nih a, tukhawma an lu dawm kâng an ngam ngai nawh a; nisienlakhawm, hienghai hi, sukdar dinga Juda ram chunga an ki inlettu hnamhai kihai chu pei thla dinga, anni chu sukhmang dinga hung an nih,” a tih a."
