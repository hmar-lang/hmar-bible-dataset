1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chislev.","Chun, Daria inlal kum linaa chun, Kisleu, thla kuona ni li ni chun Zekaria kuomah LALPA thu chu a hung tlung a."
2,"Now they of Beth-el had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Jehovah,","Chuong lai chun, Bethel mihai chun Sarezer hai, Regemmelek hai, an mihai leh LALPA ditsakna zawng dingin le,"
3,"and to speak unto the priests of the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?","sipaihai LALPA thiempuhai kuoma le zâwlneihai kuoma chun, “Kum khâng chena ka lo thaw ta hlak ang khan, keima chu insuktumin, thla kuonaa hin ka ṭap ding am a nih,” tia indawn dingin an tir a."
4,"Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts unto me, saying,","Chun, sipaihai LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
5,"Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?","“Hi rama mi po pohai le thiem- puhai kuoma chun hieng ang hin thu hril rawh, ‘Hi kum sâwmsari sûnga thla sarina le thla nganaa bu in ngheia in insuklungngai hin, keia kuoma, keima kuom ngeia bu nghei am in ni ngût le?"
6,"And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?",In fâk a in dâwn lai khawmin in ta dingin in fâkin in dâwn ni lo am a nih?
7,"Should ye not hear the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?","Hausakna le Jerusalem le a vêla khawpuihai le Simtieng le ram- phaihai chu hluo a ni laia, zâwlnei hmasahai hmanga LALPAIN thu a khêkpuihai chu in ngai naw ding am a nih?’ tiin,” a ta."
8,"And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying,","Chun, Zekaria kuoma chun LAL- PA thu chu a hung tlung a, “Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin thu a hril a nih:"
9,"Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother;","Rorêlna ṭha chu suksuok un- la, mi tinin mâni unau chungah zângaina le lunginsietna inlangtir raw se;"
10,"and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.","hmeithai amanih, fahrâ ama- nih, mikhuol amanih, mi pasie amani khawm chu nêksâwr naw unla, chun, nangni tukhawma mâni unau chung- ah a lungrilin thil suol suongtuo naw raw se,” tiin."
11,"But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.","Nisienlakhawm, an pawisa nuom nawh a, an liengko an her- hmang a, an hriet nawna dingin an nahai an suksêt a."
12,"Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.","Anih, an lungrilhai chu lungthîr angin an siem a, chuong ni naw sien chu dân le inhmaa zâwlneihai hmanga a thlaraua sipaihai LALPA- IN a pêk thuhai chu an hriet ta ding bah; chuleiin, sipaihai LALPAA in- thawka lunginsenna nasatak chu a hung tlung tah a."
13,"And it is come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts;","Chun, ama a khêk laiin an ngai nawh a; chuongchun, anni chu khêk an ta, kei khawma ngai naw ningah, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
14,"but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.","amiruokchu, an la hriet ngailo hnam po po laia chun thlivirin anni ka sukdar tah a. Chuongchun, ram chu râusanin a um tah a, tukhawm an fe thlengin an kîr nâwk ngai ta nawh a: ram duthusâm tak chu râusanah an siem ta leiin."
