1,"Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.","Aw Lebanon, i kawtkhârhai hawng rawh, I sidar thinghai chu meiin a kâng hmang theina dingin!"
2,"Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.","Aw fâr thing, inrûm rawh, sidar chu a tlu leiin; A ṭhatakhai chu suksiet an ni ta sih a! Basana thingsaisuohai, inrûm ro, Ramhâk chu a chau ta sih a!"
3,A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.,"Berâmpuhai inrûm ri chu e, An ropuina suksiet a ni ta sih a! Chu, sakeibaknei vânglai inrûm râwlri chu! Jordan ramngaw chu suksiet a ni ta sih a."
4,Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;,"LALPA ka Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih, “Sathattu berâm ruol chu châwm rawh,"
5,"whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.","ân chawtuhai chun anni chu an that a, anni chu suolah an inngai nawh a; chun, anni zawrtu khawm chun, ‘LALPA chu inpâkin um raw se, ka hausa sih a’, an ta; an berâmpuhai ngei khawm chun anni chu an lunginsiet nawh."
6,"For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.","Ram hluotuhai chu ka lunginsiet ta naw ding a ni sih a, LALPA chun a tih; nisienlakhawm, en ta, mihai chu, mi tin el chu mâni tuolbâwmhai kutah pêng ka ta, an lalhai kuta leh; chun, ram chu thâwng an ta, an kuta inthawk chun anni chu sansuok naw ningah,” tiin."
7,"So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.","Chuongchun, sathattu berâm ruol chu ka châwm a, berâm ruol chautak el nang chu. Chun, hmawl pahni ka lâk a, pakhat chu Ditsak kân bûk a, a dang chu Pumkhatna kân bûk a; chun, berâm ruol chu ka châwm tah a."
8,"And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.","Chun, thla khat sûngin berâmpu pathumhai chu ka pei thlâk a; ka lungrilin anni chu a nghawk a, anni lungril khawma kei an mi nghawk bawk sih a."
9,"Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.","Chun, kei chun, “Châwm ta naw ning cheu, a thi thi chu thi sienla; pei thlâka um um chu pei thlâkin um sienla; a la damhai khawm chun anni le anni sa chu infatuo raw hai seh,” ka ta."
10,"And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.","Chun, ka hmawl Ditsak chu ka lâk a, ka sât bawng tah a, hnamhai po po le ka thuthlung ka siem chu ka sût theina dingin."
11,And it was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.,"Chuongchun, chu ni chun sût a lo ni tah a, chuongchun, berâm ruol, nang kei mi pawisatu chun LALPA thu a nih ti i hriet a."
12,"And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty pieces of silver.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “In ngaia a ṭha chun ka hlaw chu mi pe unla, a ni naw chun, hrên el ro,” ka ta. Chuongchun, ka hlaw ding chun tangka sâwmthum an bûk tah a."
13,"And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them unto the potter, in the house of Jehovah.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Sum bâwmah the lût el rawh, man ṭhatak, annia ka man hi,” a tih a, chuong tangka sâwmthum chu ka lâk a, LALPA ina sum bâwma chun ka the lût tah a."
14,"Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.","Chun, ka hmawl dang pakhat Pumkhatna chu ka sât bawng nâwk a, Juda le Israel inkâra inunauna chu ka suktan theina dingin."
15,"And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Berâmpu invêt hmangruohai kha la la nâwk rawh."
16,"For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.","En ta, rama chun Berâmpu pei thlâka umhai chu kankuo ngailo ding le, sukdara um chu zawng ngailo ding le, suktlieka um khawm chu sukdam ngailo ding chu, ka tungding nâwk ding a ni sih a; ama chun a hliem le a hrisêl khawm chu châwm chuong naw nih a, a thâu thâu sa chu fa lem a ta, an tinhai chu nawi tamtakin kei nawi a tih,” a ta."
17,"Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.","Berâmpu, berâm ruol mâk- santu chung chu a va rik de! Kâwlhnâm chu a kut chunga chun um a ta. A mit changtieng chunga leh; A bân ṭâwl zo vawng a ta, A mit changtieng khawm chu inthim tlat a tih!"
