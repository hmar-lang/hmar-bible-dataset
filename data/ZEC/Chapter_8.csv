1,"And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,","Chun, sipaihai LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
2,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.","“Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Zion chu îtthîkna nasatakin ka îtthîk a, lungsenna nasatak leh ama chu ka îtthîk a nih,” tiin."
3,"Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Ziona chun ka hung kîr a, Jerusalem sûnga chun chêng ka tih; chun, Jerusalem chu, ‘Thudik khawpui,’ ti nîng a ta; sipaihai LALPA tlâng chu, ‘Tlâng inthieng,’ ti nîng a tih,” tiin."
4,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Jerusalem kawtthlêrhaia chun pitar le putarhai, tar êm êm leia kuta funghrawl ṭhunhai chu la um an tih."
5,And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.,"Chun, a khawpui kawtthlêrhai chu pasaltê le nuhmeitê kawt- thlêrhaia inhnelin la sip bawk an tih,” tiin."
6,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Chuong nihaia chun hi chi hlaa umhai mithmua hin a mak hle chun, keia mithmua khawm a mak hle naw ding am a nih?” sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
7,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Ngai ta, ka mihai chu saktieng ram le thlangtieng rama inthawkin sandam ka ta;"
8,"and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.","anni chu hung ṭhuoi ka ta, Jerusalem sûnga chun chêng an tih; chun, anni chu ka mihai nîng an ta, kei chu, felna le indiknain an Pathien nîng ka tih,” tiin."
9,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “LALPA in, biekin ngei chu, bâwl a ni theina dinga lungphûm phûma a um nia, zâwlnei lo um tahai baua inthawka thuhai vawisûn nia hretu- hai, in kuthai chu sukhrât ro."
10,"For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.","Khâng nihaia khan chu mi- hriem ta dingin inhlawfâkna a um nawh a, ran ta ding khawma inhlaw- fâkna hrim a um nawh a; hmêlma leiin mi a lût le suok ta ding khawma muongna hrim a um nawh: mi po po mâni tuolbâwmhai kalin ka sie sih a."
11,"But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Amiruokchu, tuhin chu hi chi hlaa umhai ta ding hin chu khâng lai nihaia ang kha chu ka ni ta naw ding a nih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
12,"For there shall be the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.","Inremna chi chu a um ta ding a ni sih a; grêphrui chun a ra insuong a ta, leihnuoi khawm chun a hlâwkna chu insuo bawk a ta, vânhai khawm chun daidaw chu hung pêng an ta; hi chi hlaa umhai hi chuong thilhai po po chu inhluotir ka tih."
13,"And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong.","Chun, hnam tinhai laia ṭawng- sephur in ni ang khan, aw Juda sûng- kuo le Israel sûngkuo, hung sanhim ka ti cheu a, malsâwmna hung ni tâng in tih: ṭi naw unla, in kuthai chu sukhrât phawt phawt el ro,” tiin."
14,"For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I repented not;","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a ti sih a, “In thlatuhaiin lunginsen dinga an mi chawktho laiin in chunga thil ṭha naw thaw ka lungril a, chu chu kân sîr naw bawk angin, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih;"
15,so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.,"chuong ang tak chun, hieng nihaia hin Juda insûng le Jerusalem chunga hin thil ṭha thaw ka lungril a nih, ṭi dêr naw ro."
16,These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;,"Hienghai hi thil in thaw dinghai chu an nih: mi tinin mâni tuolbâwm kuomah thu indiktak hril raw se: in kul kawtkhârhaia chun inremna le indikna rorêlna chu suksuok unla,"
17,"and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith Jehovah.","nangni laia mi tukhawma mâni tuolbâwm chungah thil ṭha naw a lungrilah suongtuo hlek naw raw se; inkhâmna indik naw chu ngaina naw unla, hienghai ku hi a nih thil ka theida chu, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
18,"And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,","Chun, sipaihai LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
19,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.","“Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih: Thla lina bu ngheina le, thla ngana bu ngheina le, thla sarina bu ngheina le, thla sâwmna bu ngheina chu Juda sûngkuo ta ding chun hlimna le lâwmna le thafânna ruoiṭhehai an ni lem ding a nih: chu- leiin, indikna le inremna hi ngaina ro,” tiin."
20,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities;","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Hieng ang hi la hung tlung a tih: hnamhai le khawpui tamtak hluotuhai chu la hung an ta;"
21,"and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts: I will go also.","khawpui pakhata umhai chu a danga umhai kuoma chun fêng an ta, ‘LALPA ditsakna chu hni ding le, sipaihai LALPA chu zawng suok dingin inhmawtakin fêng ei tiu: kei khawm fe vêng ka tih,’ tîng an tih."
22,"Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Jehovah.","Anih, chi tamtakhai le hnam hrâttak takhai chu LALPA ditsakna chu ngên ding le, Jerusalema sipaihai LALPA chu zawng dingin la hung an tih,” tiin."
23,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.","Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, “Chuong nihaia chun hnam po po laia mi sâwmin, ‘Pathien chu i kuomah a um ti kan hriet sih a; keini khawma hung zui vêng kan ti che,’ tiin Juda mi chu a puonhmawrah an la chel ngei ding a nih,” tiin."
