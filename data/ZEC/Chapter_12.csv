1,"The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus saith Jehovah, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him:","Israel chungthua LALPA thu phurrik chu, Vânhai chu kei- phar a, leihnuoi lungphûmhai chu phûm a, mihriem chu a sûnga a thlarau siempêktu LALPA chun hieng hin a tih:"
2,"Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem.","“Ngai ta, a vêla hnamhai po po ta dingin Jerusalem chu inthinna noah siem ka ta, chun, Juda chunga khawm, Jerusalem inhuol nia chun chuong ang chu nîng a tih."
3,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.","Chu nia chun hieng hi hung nîng a ta, hnam po pohai ta dingin Jerusalem chu lung phurriksakah siem ka ta, chuonga amaa insukrik- tuhai po po nasataka sukhliem nîng an ta; chuongchun, hnuoi chunga hnam po pohai a chunga chun inhâwrkhâwm an tih,” tiin."
4,"In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.","LALPA chun a tih, “Chu nia chun sakawr tin chu maktinain hrem ka ta, a chunga chuongtu chu invêt- nain; chun, Juda insûng chunga chun ka mit meng ka ta, hnam tin sakawr chu mit indelnain hrem ka tih."
5,"And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Jehovah of hosts their God.","Chun, Juda lalhai chun an lung- rilin, ‘An Pathien sipaihai LALPAA chun Jerusalem hluotuhai chu ka hrâtna an nih,’ la tîng an tih."
6,"In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and they of Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.","“Chu nia chun Juda lalhai chu thing laia mei thuk ang le, buphal laia meiser angin siem ka ta; vawitienga le changtienga, an vêla hnam po pohai chu sukbo an ta; chun, Jerusalem chu ama hmun Jerusalem- a ngei chun a la chêng ding a nih,” tiin."
7,"Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.","LALPA chun a hmasatakin Juda puon inhai khawm chu sanhim a ta, David sûngkaw ropuina le Jerusalem hluotuhai ropuina chu Juda chung- tienga chawimawia a um nawna dingin."
8,"In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Jehovah before them.","Chu ni chun LALPA chun Jerusalem hluotuhai chu hliekhûng a ta, chu nia anni laia hrât naw chu David ang nîng a ta; chun, David sûngkuo chu Pathien ang, an hmaa LALPA vântirko ang chu nîng a tih."
9,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.","Chun, chu nia chun Jerusalem hung thawtu hnam po pohai chu suksietna ding zawng vêng ka tih."
10,"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.","Chun, David sûngkaw chunga le, Jerusalem hluotuhai chunga chun zângaina le hni châkna thlarau buok ka ta, kei an mi sun tahnung chu mi en an tih; miin a nau khât ta dinga an sûn hlak angin ama chu sûn an ta, miin a nau lutîr chu nasataka a tuorpui hlak angin nasatakin tuorpui an tih."
11,"In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.","Chu ni chun, Megiddo ruoma Hadad-rimmon ṭa angin, Jerusalema chun nasataka sûnna um a tih."
12,"And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;","Ram chun sûngkaw tinhai chu a tum sengin sûn a tih; David sûngkaw pahnam chu a tumin, an nuhmeihai khawm a tumin; Nathan sûngkaw pahnam chu a tumin, an nuhmeihai khawm a tumin;"
13,"the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;","Levi sûngkaw pahnam chu a tumin, an nuhmeihai khawm a tum- in; Simei sûngkaw pahnam chu a tumin, an nuhmeihai khawm a tumin;"
14,"all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.","sûngkuo po po a umhai chu, sûngkaw tin chu a tumin, an nu- hmeihai khawm a tumin."
