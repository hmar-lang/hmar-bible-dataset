verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also it is with you;","A tâwp taka chun,unauhai, kan ta dingin mi ṭawngṭaipêk ro; Lalpa thu hi nangni laia a um ang khan, hrâttaka indara chawimawia a um theina ding le,"
2,and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith.,mi kâwmaw le mi suolhai laia kan him theina dingin; mi po poin ringna an nei vawng si nawh a.
3,"But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil one.","Amiruokchu, Lalpa chu ring a um a, ama chun sukdetin mi suolhai lai chun hum a ti cheu."
4,"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command.","Thu kan pêk taphawt cheu kha in zâwm hlak a, in la hung zâwm nâwk pei khawm Lalpaa chun kan ring cheu a nih."
5,"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.","Chun, Lalpa chun in lungril- hai chu Pathien hmangainaa le, Krista selnaa chun ṭhuoi lût raw se."
6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.","Chun, unauhai, kan kuoma inthawka thurosie an ihmu anga um loa, um ṭha nuom lo, unau tinrêng- haia inthawk chun insiekieng dingin, ei Lalpa Isu Krista hmingin thu kan pêk cheu."
7,For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;,"Nangni ngeiin in mîn chûk ding dân in hriet sih a, nangni lai dân naw angin kan châng naw kha."
8,"neither did we eat bread for nought at any man’s hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you:","Tu kuta inthawk khawma in bu a thlâwnin kan fak ngai bawk nawh a, nangni laia tukhawm kan sukkhâwk nawna ding cheuin, a sûn a zâna inrimtaka sin thaw pumin kan fâk lem a nih."
9,"not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us.","Kan thei naw lei a ni nawh a, nangnîn in mîn chûkna dingin, in mi enkhi dingin kan insiem lem a nih."
10,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.","In kuoma kan um lai khawm khan hi thu hi kan pêk cheu kha, “Tukhawmin sin a thaw nuom naw chun, fâk khawm fa naw raw se,” ti hi."
11,"For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.","Nangni laia ṭhenkhat um ṭha nuom ngailohai chanchin ka hriet sih a; chuonghai chun, sin hrim an thaw nawh a, an intawi mei mei lem a nih."
12,"Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.","Chuongchun, chuonghai chu, to zinga sin thaw ding le, anni bu ngei fa dingin Lalpa Isu Kristaa chun thu pein kan infui a nih."
13,"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.","Unauhai, nangni ruok chun thil ṭha thaw hi nghawk naw ro."
14,"And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.","Chun, tûkhawmin hi le- khathawna kan thu hi a zâwm naw chun, ama chu inchik unla, pâwl dêr naw ro, ân zak theina dingin."
15,"And yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.","Nisienlakhawm, hmêlma ang chun ngai naw unla, unau angin kâwk lem ro. Lalpa chu in rênga kuomah um raw se."
16,Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.,"Chun, inremna Lalpa ngei chun kumkhuoin kawng tinrêngah inrem- na pe raw se cheu."
17,"The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.","Kei Paulain, keima kut ngeia chibai ka bûkna cheu a ni hi, hi hi ka lekhathawn tina inchikna a nih; hieng anga ka ziek hi."
18,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.,Ei Lalpa Isu Krista lungin- sietna in rênga kuomah um raw se.
