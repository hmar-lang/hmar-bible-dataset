1,"Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him;","Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, ei Lalpa Isu Krista hungna le a kuoma ei hang inkhâwmna ding thua chun,"
2,"to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand;","“Lalpa Ni chu a tlung zing tah,” tina thlarau leiin amanih, thu leiin amanih, kan kuoma inthawka lekha- thawn ang leiin amanih, in lungril inhnîng el nawna ding le in buoi bawk nawna dingin kan ngên cheu a nih."
3,"let no man beguile you in any wise: for it will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,","Tûkhawmin iengkhawmin hlêm naw raw se cheu; tlûksanna chu a hung tlung hmasa zeta, Dân Bawsepa, bohmang naupa chu, a hung inlang naw chun, chu Ni chu tlung si naw nih a."
4,"he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.","Ama chu, Pathiena an inbûk taphawt le sakhuo po po doin an chunga um tumin inchawimawi a tih; chuongchun, Pathien biekina ṭhung- in Pathien ang rauin intâr suong a tih."
5,"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?",In kuoma ka hung um lai khan chuong thu chu ka hril hlak cheu ti in hriet zing naw am a nih?
6,"And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.",Ama hun tak chauah a hung inlang theina dingin iengin am a khapa ti tuhin in hriet.
7,"For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.","Dân bawsietna thurûk chun tu khawm hin sin a thaw zing a ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, a khaptu chun lâk hmanga a um hma poin khap a ta."
8,"And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming;","Lâk hmang a ni pha chun Dân Bawsepa chu hung inlang nghâl tâng a tih. Lalpa Isun ama chu a baua thuokin sukhlum a ta, a hunga inlârnain sukbohmang a tih."
9,"even he, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,","Chu Dân Bawsepa hungna chu Setan sinthaw zie ang peiin, thil- thawtheina tinrêng dâm, inchikna tinrêng dâm, khêl thilmak tinrêng leh,"
10,"and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.","bohmang zinghai dinga fel nawna hlêmna tinrêng leh nîng a tih, sandama an um theina dinga thutak hmangaina chu an pawm naw leiin."
11,"And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie:","Chuleichun, thukhêl chu an awina dingin Pathienin suol sin- thawna chu an kuomah intlungtir a tih,"
12,"that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.","thutak awi loa, fel nawnaa lâwm lemtuhaiin thiemnaw an chang vawng theina dingin."
13,"But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:","Unau, Lalpa idittakhai, Thla- rau isukthiengnaa le thutak ring leia sandama um dingin a tîra inthawka Pathienin a thlang cheu leiin, in chungthua hin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu hril rawp ding hrim kan nih."
14,"whereunto he called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Chuong anga ding chun ama chun kan Chanchin Ṭhaa hin a ko cheu kha, ei Lalpa Isu Krista ropuina nei dingin."
15,"So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.","Chuongchun, unauhai, ngîr det unla, thurosiehai chu, thu hrilin amanih, kan lekhathawnin amanih kan inchûktir cheu kha, pawm tlat ro."
16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,","Chuongchun, ei Lalpa Isu Krista ngei le, Pathien ei Pa, a mi hmangaitu le lunginsietna leia cha- tuona thlamuongna le beiseina ṭha mi petu chun,"
17,comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.,"in lungrilhai chu sukthla- muongin, thil thaw ṭha le thu hril ṭha tinrêngin sukdet raw se."
