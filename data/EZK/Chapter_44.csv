2,"And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah, “Hi dâi kawtkhâr hi in khâr zing ding a na, hawng ding a ni nawh; mi tukhawm ahin lût bawk naw ni hai, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chu a lo lût ta sih a; chuleiin, khâr a ni zing ding a nih."
3,"As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.","Chun, lal chungthua chun, LALPA hmaa bei fa dingin lal angin chutaka chun ṭhung a ta, dâi kawt- khâr tuolpûk lampuia khan lût a ta, chu bawka chun a suok nâwk ding a nih,” a ta."
4,"Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.","Chun, in hmaia hmâr tieng dâi kawtkhâra chun a mi ṭhuoi a; chun, ka hei en a, ngai ta, LALPA ropuina chun LALPA in chu a sip a; chuong- chun, bawkkhupin ka tlu tah a."
5,"And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary.","Chun, LALPA chun ka kuomah a hril a, “Mihriem naupa, inchikṭha la, i mithai khan en rawh, LALPA Ina thupêkhai po po chungthu le, chutaka dânhai po po chungthua ka thuhril chu i nahai khan lo ngai bawk la; chun, ina va lûtna le, hmun inthienga inthawka suokna tinhai chu inchik ṭha bawk rawh."
6,"And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,","Chun, mi helhai, Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun hieng hin hril la: Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Aw nangni Israel sungkuo, in tirdakum- na chu huntâwk ta raw se;"
7,"in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add unto all your abominations.","lungrila sertan lo le tisa khawma sertan lo, hmêlmakhai ka hmun in- thienga um ding le, sukpawrche dinga ka in ngeia in hung lâklût leia in tirdakumna hi huntâwk ta raw se; Bei dâm, sathâu dâm, thisen dâm chu in inhlân lai chun, ka thuthlunghai chu in bawsiet a, in tirdakumnahai chu belsa ding chauin."
8,And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.,"Chun, ka thil inthienghai vêng ṭhatna sin chu in kawl nawh a, amiruokchu, chu ka hmun inthienga chun in aia ka sinhai kawltu dinghai in ruot lem a."
9,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih: Mi hmêlmak, lungrila ser- tan lo, tisa khawma sertan lo mi hmêlmak ieng ang khawm Israel thlahai laia lo um ta khawm chu, ka hmun inthienga chun a lût ding a ni nawh a."
10,"But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.","Nisienlakhawm, Israelhai, an milimhai hnawta an invâk hmang laia keimaa inthawka hlataka fe tahai Levi mihai chun anni suolna chu phur an tih."
11,"Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.","Ina chun rawngbâwlin, in dâi kawtkhârhaia chun enkawlin, ka hmun inthienghaia chun rawngbâwl- tu nîng an tih; mipuihai ta dinga inthawina le pumrawhmang thilin- hlâna ding chu that an ta, anni rawngbâwlpêk dingin an hmaa chun ngîr an tih."
12,"Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.","An milimhai hmaa chun an rawng an lo bâwlpêk ta leiin Israel sûngkuo ta ding chun suolnaa tlûkna lung an lo ni tah a; chuleiin, an chunga chun ka kut kân let a, an suolna chu anni ngeiin phur an tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
13,"And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.","Keia ta dingin thiempu sin chu thaw dingin, keima hnaia chun an hung ding a ni nawh a; ka thil in- thieng a ieng khawm, le thil inthiengtakhai chu an hung hnai ding a ni nawh; amiruokchu, an lo thaw tah, an tirdakumnahai le an inzakna chu anni ngeiin phur an tih."
14,"Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.","Amiruokchu, anni chu in sin- haia enkawltuhaiah siem ka ta, chu- taka rawngbâwlnahai po poa ding le, chutaka thaw dinghai po poa chun."
15,"But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah:","“Amiruokchu, thiempu Levi mihai, Zadok naupasalhai, keimaa inthawka Israelhai an invâk hmang lai khawma ka hmun inthieng enkawlna sin kawltuhai chu, ka ta dinga rawngbâwl dingin keia hnaiah hung an ta; sathâu le thisen chu inhlân dingin ka hmaa chun ngîr an tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih;"
16,"they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.","ka hmun inthienga chun lût an ta, ka rawng mi bâwlpêk dingin ka dawkân hnaia chun hung an ta, ka sin chu kawl an tih."
17,"And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.","Chun, huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema dâi kawtkhâra an lût pha chun hieng hin nîng a ta, puon zai inhmi puonin an inthuom ding a nih; huon sûng tuollai sûngril lem le, dâi kawtkhâra a sûnga rawng an bâwl lai chun, an chungah sahmul puon an inbel ding a ni nawh a."
18,"They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat.","An luhaia chun puon zai inhmi lukâwmhai kâwm an ta, an kâwnga chun puon zai inhmi kekawrhai bun bawk an ta. Thlan suksa thei chi hrim hrimin an inhrên ding a ni nawh."
19,"And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments.","Chun, huon sûng tuollai puo lem, mipuihai umna huon sûng tuol- lai puo lema chun an hung suok pha chun, an rawngbâwlna an silfênhai kha an hlîp ding a na, chuong chu pindan inthienga chun sieng an ta, silfên dangin an inbel ding a nih, chuongchun, mipuihai chu an silfên hmanga an sukthieng naw nawna dingin."
20,"Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads.","“An luhai chu an vâw kawl ding a ni nawh a, an sam chu inṭhang seitir chu an phal bawk ding a ni nawh a; an lu chu a ṭhawlin an ṭhawl chau ding a nih."
21,"Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.",Huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema an lût laiin thiempu tukhawma uoin a dâwn ding a ni nawh.
22,"Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.","Nuhmei ding khawma hmeithai amanih, mâka um amani chu an nei ding a ni nawh a; amiruokchu, Israel sûngkuo chia mi nunghâk hnakhat- hai an lâk ding a nih; annawleh, hmeithai, thiempu nuhmei thisan."
23,"And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.","Ka mihai chu thil inthieng le thil narânhai inkâra danglamnahai chun inchûktir an ta, thil thieng le thieng naw chu an inhriet ṭhentir ding a nih."
24,And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to mine ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.,"Thubuoia chun rorêltuin an ngîr ding a na; keia rorêl dân dungzui peiin ro an rêl ding a nih; ka ruoiṭhe hunbi neihaia chun ka thuruothai, ka dânhai chu an zâwm ding a nih; chun, ka châwlni khawm chu an inser bawk ding a nih."
25,"And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.","Chun, mi thi kâwla chun anni le anni insukpawrche dingin an hung ding a ni nawh a, amiruokchu, pa ta dingin amanih, nu ta dingin amanih, naupa ta dingin amanih, naunu ta dingin amanih,unaupa ta dingin amanih, farnu pasal la nei lo ta dingin amanih chun anni chu insukpawrche thei an tih."
26,"And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.","Chun, sukthieng a ni hnunga chun ama chu ni sari tiempêk an tih."
27,"And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, hmun inthienga, huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema, hmun in- thienga rawngbâwl dinga a fe ni chun, a suol thilinhlân chu ân hlân ding a nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
28,And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.,"Chun, rochan nei nâwng an ta; kei hi an rochan chu ka nih; Israela chun ro pe naw ti nih a, kei hi an thilnei chu ka nih."
29,"They shall eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.","Bu thilinhlân dâm, suol thilin- hlân dâm, bawsietna thilinhlân dâm chu fâng an ta; Israel laia thilhlân tinrênghai chu an ta nîng a tih."
30,"And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, shall be for the priest: ye shall also give unto the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house.","Chun, thil tinrêng rahmasahai hmasatak le, thil tinrêng thêna in- hlânhai chu, in thilinhlânhai po po chu thiempuhai chan nîng a ta, chun, thiempu kuoma chun in beihmet hmasatak chu in in sûnga malsâwm- na a um theina dingin in pêk bawk ding a nih."
31,"The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast.","Thiempuhai chun thilhring amaa thi amanih, keinawia um amanih, ramsa khawm ni sien, vate khawm ni sien an fâk ding a ni nawh."
