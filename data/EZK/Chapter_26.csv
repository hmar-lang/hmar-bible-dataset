1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Kum sâwm pakhatna, chu thlaa ni khat ni chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
2,"Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste:","“Mihriem naupa, Tura chun Jerusalem chunga chun, E he, hnam tinhai dâi kawtkhâr chu a tliek a ni ta hi; tuhin keia kuom tieng a hung inher tah a, kei chu hluosip nâwkin um ka ta; tuhin ama chu suksiet a ni hi, a ti leiin,"
3,"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, aw Tura, nang ka dodâl che a nih; tuipuiin a fâwnhai chu a hung insuoktir angin, hnam tam- takhai chu nangma do ding chein ka siem ding a nih."
4,"And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.","Chun, anni chun Tura kul bang- hai chu suksieng an ta, a in insânghai chu sukchim an tih; kei khawma a pilvut chu amaa inthawkin ziet- thlâng ka ta, ama chu lungpui fil ruouah siem ka tih."
5,"She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah; and she shall become a spoil to the nations.","Tuisuorieta lênhai keimarna hmun hung nîng a ta, Lalpa PATHIEN chun, ka hril ta sih a, a tih; chuongchun, hnamhai ta ding chun râllâk sum hung nîng a tih."
6,And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.,"A naunuhmeihai rama umhai chu kâwl hnâma sukhlum nîng an ta, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
7,"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and much people.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti sih a: Ngai ta, hmartienga in- thawkin, lalhai lal Babulon lal Nebukadnezzar chu, sakawr taw- lailîrhai leh, pâwl ruol le mi tam- tak leh Tura chunga hin hung ṭhuoi ka ta."
8,"He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field; and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee.","Rama i naunuhmei umhai chu ama chun kâwlhnâmin that a ta; kul bâwl khum a ti cheh a; hnuoi dêngpâwng khum a ti cheh a, phaw chawihai inhuol khumtir a ti che."
9,"And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.",I kul chu epin a kâpna khâwlhai chu rem a ta; i in insânghai chu a hreipuihaiin sukchim a tih.
10,"By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.","A sakawrhai tam lei chun pilvut chun hung inkhum an ti cheh a; khawpuia lûtna siema uma, mihai an lût anga, i dâi kawtkhârhaia chun a hung lût pha chun sakawr taw- lailîrhai, tawlailîrhai le sakawr chung chuong mihai ri chun i kul bang chu inhnîng a ta."
11,With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword; and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.,"A sakawrhai ketinhai chun i kawtthlêrhai po po hung chîl a ta; i mihai chu kâwlhnâmin that a ta, i hrâtna bulpui lungphunhai khawm chu hnuoi chungah tlûng an tih."
12,"And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.","I hausaknahai chu râllâk sum- ah siem an ta, i sumdâwngna thilhai khawm chu lâng an tih; i kulhai chu hung suksieng an ta, i in inhawitak takhai chu sukse bawk an ta, i lung- hai, i thinghai i thil nawihai chenin tuihai laia chun sieng an tih."
13,And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.,"Chun, i hlahai ri chu intâwptir ka ta: i ṭingṭang rihai khawm chu hriet ni ta naw nih."
14,"And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I Jehovah have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chuongchun, lungpui fil ruouah siem ka ti cheu a, lênhai keimarna hmun hung nîng i tih; chun, bâwl khawm ni nâwk ta naw ti ni; kei LALPA hin ka lo hril ta sih a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
15,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun Tura kuomah hieng hin a tih; I sûnga chun thatna chu siem a ni pha, hliem chu an inrûm pha chun, i tlûkna ria chun thlierkârhai chu an inthin naw ding am a nih?"
16,"Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee.","Tuisuorieta lalhai po po chu an lalṭhungphahaia inthawk chun ṭhung thlâng an ta, an lal puonhai chu sieng an ta, an silfên cheimawihai chu hlîp an ta, anni chu inthinnain inthuom tâng an tih; leihnuoi chungah ṭhung an ta, ieng lai khawmin inthin an ta, nangma chu maktîng an ti che."
17,"And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all that dwelt there!","Chun, nangmaa chun sûnna hla phuok an ta, i kuoma chun, ‘Khawpui hmingthang, tuisuorieta chêng mihai ihluo, Ama le a hluotuhai khawm tuisuorieta hrât, A hluotuhai po po chunga an ṭiumna inumtir thei hiel chu, Iengtiziea suksieta um el am i ni ta leh!"
18,"Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure.","I tlûkna nia chun thlierkârhai chu inthin ngei an tih, Anih, i fe hmang tâk lei chun tuisuorieta thlierkârhai chu beidawng an tih,’ tîng an tih."
19,"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee;","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti sih a: khawpui hluo loa umhai anga, khawpui râusana uma ka siem pha che chun; li inthûk chu i chunga chun ka hung lâka, tui nasatakhai chun ân khum pha che."
20,"then will I bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living.","Chun, tienlaia mihai vânsama ṭumhai kuoma chun ṭhuoi ka ti che a, vânsama lo fe thla tahai lai, tienlaia inthawka râusana um tah hmuna hai, leihnuoi hnuoi tieng panga chêng dingin siem ka ti che a; hluo ni ta ngai hrim hrim naw ti ni; chun, mi hring rama chun i ropuina chu sie bawk ta naw ning;"
21,"I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt no more have any being; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord Jehovah.","nang chu ṭiumah siem lem ka ti cheh a, um ta naw ti ni; zawngin um hlak la khawm, hmu hrim hrim ni ta naw ti nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
