4,"Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.","I thisen i lo insuotahaia chun thiemlo chang i lo ni tah a; milim i lo siemahai chun nang chu i lo in- sukpawrche ta bawk a; i nihai chu hung hnai dingin i siem a, i kumhai bi ruota chun i hung tlung ṭêp ta bawk a, chuleiin, hnamhai laia chun hril- insîmah ka siem che a nih, ram- bunghai po poa nuizabûr dinga leh."

11,"And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.","Mi pakhat chun a tuolbâwm nuhmei chunga chun thil tirdakum chu a thawh a; mi dang chun hurtak- in a monu chu a sukpawrche bawk a; mi dang chun i sûngah a pa naunu, a farnu chu ân tlâwm bawk a."

18,"Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross unto me: all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.","“Mihriem naupa, Israel sûng- kuo hi ka ta dingin êksie an ni tah; pûm meia chun an rêng chun darsen dâm, rângva dâm, thîr dâm, suon dâm an na; tangkaraw êksie chu an nih."
19,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Êksie chu in hung ni tâk leiin ngai ta u, Jerusalem sûnga hin kei khâwm ka ti cheu."
20,"As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you.","Tangkaruo dâm, dârsen dâm, thîr dâm, rângva dâm, suon dâm pûmmeia an mût dinga suktui dinga an lâk khâwm angin, ka lunginsenna le ka ṭiumnain la khâwm ka ti cheu a, chutaka chun sieng ka ti cheu a, suktui ka ti cheu."
21,"Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.","Anih, la khâwm ka ti cheu a, ka lunginsenna meiin râwng ka ti cheu; chuongchun, chutaka chun intui in tih."
22,"As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out my wrath upon you.","Tangkaruo chu pûmmeia ân tui angin chuong ang chun chutaka chun intui in tih, chuongchun, kei LALPA hin in chungah ka lunginsenna chu ka hung bunthlâk a nih ti hre tâng in tih,” tiin."
23,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a:"
24,"Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.","“Mihriem naupa, amanu kuoma chun hril la; Ram thienglo le, lungin- senna nia a chunga ruo tlâk nawna ang chu i nih, ti rawh."
25,"There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof.","Sakeibaknei inrûmin a sa fâk ding ân rûm khum angin, a sûnga chun a zâwlneihai chu phierrûkna a um a; mi tin hringin an fâk zo a, thil hluhai le thil rohai chu an lâk a, a sûnga chun hmeithai tamtak an siem a."
26,"Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.","A thiempuhai chun ka dâna chun thawluina an hmang a; ka thil inthienghai chu an sukpawrche a; thil pângngai le thil inthieng khawm chu an ṭhe hran nawh a, chuongchun, mihai khawm chu thil inthieng le thienglo chu hre hran dingin an siem nawh a; ka châwlnia inthawkin an mithai an hup a; anni laia chun sukhmingsiet ka ni tah a nih."
27,"Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.","A sûnga a lalhai chu satene an sa fâk ding innghir khumhai ang chu an na; thisen insuoa, mi hring sukbo- hmanga hlâwkna indik lo an hmuna dingin."
28,"And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah hath not spoken.","Chun, a zâwlneihai chun an kuoma aisân inkhêlhai le, teplohai chu hmuin anni ta ding chun chirhak sukhnâk lo chun an chârkhum a; LALPAIN thu a hril naw sa khawma, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, an tih a."
29,"The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.","Chu ram mipuihai chun nêk- sâwrna an hmang a, inrûk an chîng bawk a; anih, tlasamhai le mi rimsi- hai chu an suklungngai a; mikhuol chu indik lotakin an nêksâwr a."
30,"And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none.","Anni lai chun mi, ram chu ka suksiet nawna dinga dâi chu siem ṭha ding le, ram ta dinga, ân âwngnaa ka hmaa ngîr ding ka zawng a, nisien- lakhawm, tukhawm ka hmu nawh a,"
31,"Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chuleiin, ka lunginsenna chu an chunga chun ka bunthlâk a, ka lunginsenna mei chun anni chu ka kâng hmang tah a; an lampuihai chu anni lu chunga ngei chun ka hung intlungtir tah a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
