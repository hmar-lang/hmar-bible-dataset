1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
2,"Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;","“Mihriem naupa, thukhirkhân sie suok la, Israel sûngkuohai kuoma chun tekhithu hril rawh;"
3,"and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih a, Mupui ropuitak, thla ropuitak le chang seitakhai nei, hmula sip, ze hran hran nei chu Lebanona chun a hung a, sidar thing zîka chun a hung a;"
4,"he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it unto a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.","a zîk insâng tak chu a chuk tan a, Kanaan rama chun a put hmang tah a; sumdâwng mihai khawpuia chun ân thlâk tah a."
5,"He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow-tree.","Chun, chu ram thlai chi chu a lâk bawk a, leihnuoi ṭhataka chun a phun tah a; tui tamtak kâwla chun a sieh a; phahrâm thing angin a sieh a."
6,"And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.","Chun, a hung inṭhang chun, grêphrui inhnuoitaka inzâm mi a hung na, a kâuhai chu ama tieng chun ân zâm lêt a, a zunghai chu ama hnuoia chun an um a; chuong- chun, grêphrui a hung na, kâuhai a hung nei a; dâwnhai a hung insuo tah a."
7,"There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.","Chun, mupui dang ropuitak thla ropuitakhai le hmul tamtak nei a um bawk a; chun, ngai ta, grêphrui chun a zunghai chu ama tieng chun ân kawmtir a, a kâuhai khawm chu ama tienga bawk chun ân dâwn suoktir a, tui a buok zing theina dingin. A phunna hmuna inthawk chun,"
8,"It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.","tui tamtakhai sîrah hnuoi ṭhatna hmuna chun phunsawn a ni tah a, kâuhai a hung insuoh a, ra a hung nei a, grêphrui ṭhatak a hung ni theina dingin."
9,"Say thou, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it be raised from the roots thereof.","Hril rawh, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih; a puitling ding am a nih? A hna inder tharhai po po chu a vuoi theina dingin a zunghai chu a phâwi dawkin, a rahai chu a sât thlâk naw ding am a nih? A zung- haia phâwi dawktu ding mi tam rak le thilthawtheina nasatak khawm ngai chuong naw nih."
10,"Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the beds where it grew.","Anih, ngai ta, phunin um de sienkhawm a puitling ding am a nih? Sak thliin a hung mût pha chun, a vuoi vawng el naw ding am a nih? A ṭona hmuna inthawk ngei chun vuoi a tih,” tiin."
11,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",Chu nawa khawm chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a;
12,"Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon.","“Sûngkaw hel hmanghai kuoma chun thu hril la, ‘Hieng thilhai hi ieng tina am a na ti in hriet naw maw?’ tiin, hril rawh, ngai ta, Babulon lal chu Jerusalema chun a hung a, chutaka lal le, chutaka lal nauhai chu a ṭhuoi a, ama kuomah Babulona chun a fepui tah a;"
13,"And he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;","chun, lal chi khawm chu a ṭhuoi a, ama le chun thuthlung a siem tah a, chun, ama khawm chun inkhâmna hnuoiah a hung ṭhuoi a, rama mi thilthawtheihai chu a lâk hmang a;"
14,"that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.","lalram chu a hung inhnuoi a, ama khâta ân dawm kâng thei nawna dingin, chu a thuthlung chu a zâwm lei chaua a ngîr theina dingin."
15,"But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?","Amiruokchu, mi tamtak le sakawrhai an pêk theina dingin, ama aiawtu chu Aigupta rama tirin, ama chunga chun a hel tah a. A hlawtling ding am a nih? Chuong ang thil- thawtu chun a pumpel ding am a nih? Thuthlung chu bawse siin a pumpel ding am a nih?"
16,"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.","Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; ama chu lala siemtu, a inkhâmna a hmusit le, a thuthlung a bawsietpêk lal umna hmun, ama kuomah Babulon sûng ngeia chun thîng a tih."
17,"Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.","Mi tamtak chu sât thla dinga kulhai bâwla, tlângpâwnghai siema an um pha chun, Pharao le a sipai pâwl thilthawtheitakhai le, a pâwl ropuitakhai chun indonaa dingin iengkhawm thawpêk naw ni hai."
18,"For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape.","Thuthlung chu bawsein, in- khâmna chu a lo pêk tah a, amiruok- chu, hieng thilhai po po hi a la thaw ta rawp sih a; pumpel naw hrim hrim a tih."
19,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih; Ka hring zing angin ka inkhâmna a hmusit le, ka thuthlung a bawsiet ta chu ama lu chunga ngei chun hung intlungtir ngei ngei ka tih."
20,"And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.","Chun, a chunga chun ka lên chu keiphar ka ta, ka chânga chun ama chu âwk a ta, ama chu Babulonah hung ṭhuoi ka ta, chutaka chun a bawsietna, ka chunga a lo bawsietna chu a kuomah phût ka tih."
21,"And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.","Chun, a pâwlhai po po laia a tlân hmanghai po po chu kâwlhnâm- ah tlûng an ta, chun, a la um zinghai khawm chu kil tinah sukdar ni bawk an tih; chun, kei LALPA hin ka lo hril ta a nih ti hre tâng i tih."
22,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain:","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; sidar lêr zîk insâng chu lâng ka ta, phun ka tih; a lêr zîktaka inthawk chun a kâu dâwng chu ektliek ka ta, tlâng insângtak le lang- sârtak chungah phun ka tih;"
23,"in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of the branches thereof shall they dwell.","Israel insângna tlânga chun phun ka ta; kâuhai hung insuong a ta, ra hung nei a ta, sidar thing ṭhatak hung nîng a ta; a hnuoia chun vate tinrênghai chu chêng an ta; chutaka a kâuhai hlima chun chêng an tih."
24,"And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it.","Chun, chu loa thing po pohai chun kei LALPA chun thing insâng chu ka keihnuoi a, thing inhnuoi chu ka suksâng tah, thing hring chu ka sukṭâwl a, thing ṭâwl chu ka suk- hring tah ti hrieng an tih; kei LALPA chun ka hrilin ka thaw tah a nih,” tiin."
