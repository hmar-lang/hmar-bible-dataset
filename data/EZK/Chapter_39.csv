2,"and I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel;","nang chu i hnung tieng in- nghattir ka ti cheh a, ṭhuoi ka ti cheh a, hmârtieng kilkhâwr tak hmunhaia inthawk chun hung insuoktir ka ti che a, Israel tlânghai chunga chun ṭhuoi ka ti che;"

4,"Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples that are with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.","Israel tlânghai chunga chun tlûng i ta; nang le i pâwlhai po po le, hnam tamtak nanga kuoma umhai le chun, chun, fâk zo dingin vate chi tin phîngṭâmhai le rama ramsahai kuoma chun pêng ka ti che."

6,"And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Magog le thlierkâra chêngtuhai chunga chun mei tir ka ta; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
7,"And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; neither will I suffer my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.","Chun, ka hming inthieng chu ka mi Israelhai laia chun suklangsâr ka ta, ka hming inthieng sukpawrchea a um ding hrim hrim chu ngai thei naw ningah, chun, hnamhai chun LALPA, Israela Mi Inthieng chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
8,"Behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah; this is the day whereof I have spoken.","Ngai ta, a hung tlung mêk a nih, thaw a ni ngei ding a nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; hi hi a nih ni ka ihril chu."
9,"And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years;","Chun, chuong Israel khawpui- haia chêngtuhai chu fe suok an ta, hriemhrei meihai chu siem an ta, râwng an tih; âwmphaw le phawhai dâm, thalngul le thalhai dâm, hmawl- funghai dâm, feihai dâm, râwng an ta, chun, chuonghai chun kum sari sûng mei chu tîng an tih;"
10,"so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord Jehovah.","chuongchun, rama inthawkin thing la naw ni hai a, rampui hnuoia inthawkin pakhat khawm phûr bawk naw ni hai; hriemhreihaiin mei an ti ding a ni sih a; anni suksetuhai chu suksieng an ta, anni inruhmangtuhai chu inruhmang an tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
11,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.","“Chun, chu nia chun, Israela chun, tuisuoriet saktieng panga fethlengtuhai phairuom chu Gog ta ding chun inphûmna hmun dingin pêng ka ta; chutaka chun Gog le a mihai po po chu phûm an tih; chun, anni chun ‘Hamon-gog Phairuom’ ti nghe nghêng an tih."
12,"And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.","Chun, ram chu an sukthieng theina dingin Israel sûngkuohai chun anni chu thla sari sûng phûm an ta."
13,"Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Anih, chu rama mihai po po chun phûm an ta, chawimawia ka um nia chun anni ta ding chun hriet zing tlâk nîng a tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
14,"And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through, those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.","Chun, ram chu sukfai dinga ram fang suok a, ruong phûm loa umhai phûm dinga sina nei ding mi ruot hran an ta, anni chun thla sari tâwpah zawng ṭan an tih."
15,"And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.","Chun, chuong ram fangtuhai chun fang an ta, mi tukhawma mi- hriem ru a hmu chun, a sira chun inchikna târ a ta, a phûmtuhaiin Harmon-gog phairuoma an phûm hmakhat chun."

17,"And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; ramhnuoia sa tinrêng le, vate chi tinrênghai kuoma chun thu hril la, hieng hin hril rawh: Hung inkhâwm unla, hung ro, sa chu in fâka thisen chu in dâwn theina dingin Israel tlâng chunghaia inthâwina ropui- tak, in ta dinga kân thâwina, kân thâwina sîr tina inthawkin hung inkhâwm ro."
18,"Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.","Mi thilthawtheihai sa chu fâng in ta; hnuoia lalhai le, berâmchalhai le, berâmtehai le, kêlhai le, bâwng- chalhai, Basan rama châwmthâuhai po po thisen chu dâwn in tih."
19,"And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.","In ta dinga kân thâwina thâu chu in khawp hmakhat fâng in ta, thisen chu in inrui hmakhat dâwn bawk in tih."
20,"And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, ka dâwkâna chun sa- kawrhai, sakawr tawlailîrhai, mi thilthawtheitakhai le indo mihai po po chun sukkhawpin um in tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
21,"And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.","Chun, ka ropuina chu hnamhai laia chun sieng ka ta, chuongchun, hnam po pohai chun rorêlna ka suk- tlung ta le, an chunga ka kut kân nghat chu hmûng an tih."
22,"So the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God, from that day and forward.","Chun, chu nia inthawka a hnungtieng chen chun Israel sûngkuo chun LALPA an Pathien ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
23,"And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.","Chun, hnamhai chun Israel sûngkuo chu an suol leia sala intâng an nih ti hrieng an ta; ka chungah an lo bawsiet tah a, kei khawma ka hmai ka thuppêk bawk leiin; chuongchun, an hmêlmahai kutah anni chu ka pêk a, an rêng el chun kâwlhnâma chun an lo tlu tah a."
24,According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid my face from them.,"An inthieng nawna ang pei le, an bawisietnahai ang peiin an chunga chun ka lo thaw tah a; chun, ka hmai chu ka thuppêk bawk a."
25,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.","“Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Tuhin Jakob sal intângna chu hung la kîr ka ta; Israel sûngkuo pumpui ta ding chun zângaina nei ka tih; chun, ka hming inthieng khawm humhal bawk ka tih."
26,"And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;","An rama chun himtakin an chêng a, tukhawma anni chu an sukṭi naw pha chun, an inzakna, an baw- sietnahai po po, ka chunga an lo bawsietnahai chu phur an tih;"
27,"when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.","hnamhai laia inthawka anni ka hung ṭhuoi kîr nâwk a, an hmêlmahai rama inthawka anni ka kei khâwma, hnam tamtakhai mithmua annia chawimawia ka um pha chun."
28,"And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there;","Chun, hnamhai laia sala intâng dinga kân fetir a, anni rama ngei chun ka ṭhuoi khâwm nâwka hin, LALPA an Pathien chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an ta; chutaka chun anni chu tukhawm mâksan nâwk ta naw ningah,"
29,"neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.","annia inthawk chun ka hmai chu thuppêk ta bawk naw ning a; Israel sûngkaw chunga chun ka thla- rau ka buok ta sih a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
