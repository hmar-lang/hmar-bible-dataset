1,"In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.","Kan sal intâng kum sâwmhni panga kum, chu kum kum ṭantir, chu thla ni sâwm ni, khawpui chu suksieta a um hnung kum sâwm pali kum, chu ni le le chun LALPA kut chu ka chungah a um a, chung- tienga chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a."
2,"In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.","Pathien thil hmulâwknaa chun Israel ramah a mi ṭhuoi a, tlâng insângtak, a simtienga chun khawpui riruong chu a um a, chutaka chun a mîn ṭhum tah a."
3,"And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.","Chun, chu tieng chun a mi ṭhuoi a, chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat, a hmêl- put dân chu dârsen ang, a kuta ziza hruol le, inkhina luonghmawl chawi a um a; dâi kawtkhâra chun ama chu a ngîr a."
4,"And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.","Chu mi chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, i mithai khan en la, i nahai khan lo ngai bawk la, ka în hmutir dinghai che po po chunga chun i lungril sie rawh; i kuoma kân hmutir theina ding chea hi tienga hung ṭhuoi i ni hrim a; chuongchun, i hmuhai po po chu Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun puong rawh,” a tih a."
5,"And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.","Chun, ngai ta, in puotienga chun bang chu a vêlin a um a; chu mipa kuta inkhina luonghmawl chu tawng ruka sei a na, tawng khat le kut- phabawk seng a nih; chun, a in sa tieng chu ân khi a, luonghmawl khat a na; ân sâng tieng khawm chu luong- hmawl khat bawk."
6,"Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.","Chun, saktieng ngha dâi kawt- khâra chun a hung a, chutaka kai- lâwnhaia chun a hang feh a; dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk chu ân khih a, luonghmawl khat a na, tuolpûk dang khawm chu luonghmawl khat bawk a nih."
7,"And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.","Chun, vêngna pindan tinhai chu luonghmawl khata sei, luonghmawl khata lien a nih; vêngna pindan inkâr chu tawng nga a na; dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk chu, a in tieng panga tuol- pûka chun luonghmawl khat a nih."
8,"He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.","In tieng panga a dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk khawm chu ân khih a, tawng riet a nih."
9,"Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk chu ân khi a, tawng riet a nih, chun, kawtkhâr bieng chu tawng hni; chun, a dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk chu in tieng panga chun a um a."
10,"And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr vêngna pindanhai chu, saktieng hi tieng panga chun pathum a na; pathum chu intie seng an na; chun, a kawtkhâr bienghai khawm chu hi tieng le saw tienga chu intie an nih."
11,"And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;","Chun, a kawtkhâr kawt lien khangtieng chu ân khi a, tawng sâwm a na; a kawtkhâr seizie chu tawng sâwmpathum;"
12,"and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.","chun, vêngna pindan hmaa a rei sîr chu hi tieng sîrah tawng khat, khing tieng sîra chun tawng khat bawk; chun, vêngna pindanhai chu hi tieng sîra chun tawng ruk, khing tieng sîra chun tawng ruk bawk."
13,"And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door.","Chun, vêngna pindan chunga pakhata inthawkin pindan dang chunga dâi kawtkhâr chu ân khi a; a khang chu tawng sâwmhni panga a na, kawtkhâra inthawka kawtkhâr dang chenin."
14,"He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court reached unto the posts, round about the gate.","Chun, tuolpûk chu ân khi a, tawng sawmhni a na; huon sûng tuollai dâi kawtkhâr chen chu a tuol zâwl chu a nih."
15,And from the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.,"Chun, lûtna dâi kawtkhâr tuolthlâka inthawka dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk sûngril lem tuolthlâk chen chu tawng sâwmnga a nih."
16,"And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon each post were palm-trees.","Dâi kawtkhâr chun a vêlin, pin- dan kêm kawtkhâr bieng tienga chîn inzui pei tukverhai a nei a. Chuong ang bawkin a tuolpûk sûngtieng a vêlin tukverhai an um bawk a, a banhaia chun intûm thing lim a um a."
17,"Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.","Chun, huon sûng tuollai puo lema chun a mi ṭhuoi a, chun, ngai ta, pindanhai le lungpha, a vêla huon sûng tuollai dinga an siem chu a um a; lungpha chunga chun pindan sâwmthum a um a."
18,"And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.","Lungpha chu dâi kawtkhârhai sîra chun a um a, dâi kawtkhârhai le inchen chie, lungpha hnuoihnung lem chu a nih."
19,"Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr hnuoi- hnung lema tuolthlâka inthawka, a huon sûng tuollai sûngril lem tuol- thlâk khangtieng chu ân khi a, a saktieng a le a hmârtieng chun tawng za khat ve ve a nih."
20,"And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.","Chun, a huon sûng tuollai puo lem dâi kawtkhâr, hmârtienga ngha chu, a chu dungtieng le chu khang- tieng chu ân khi a."
21,"And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.","Chun, vêngna pindanhai chu hi tieng sîrah pathum, khingtieng sîrah pathum bawk a nih; chun, a kawt- khâr bienghai le a tuolpûkhai chu a dâi kawtkhâr pakhatna tie seng chu a na; a dung tieng chu tawng sâwmnga a na, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwm- hni panga."
22,"And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.","A tukverhai le, a tuolpûk le, chutaka intûm thinghai chu, sak- tieng panga ngha dâi kawtkhâra mi tie seng kha an nih; chun, sirbi pa- sariin a hang tlung a, chun, tuolpûk chu sûngtienga chun a um a."
23,"And there was a gate to the inner court over against the other gate, both on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr dang zâwn- a chun, tuollai sûng sûngril lema dinga dâi kawtkhârhai a um a; sak- tieng panga le hmârtieng panga chun dâi kawtkhâra inthawka dâi kawt- khâr chen chun tawng za khatin ân khi a."
24,"And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.","Chun, sim tieng panga chun a mi ṭhuoi a, simtienga dâi kawtkhâr chu ka hmuh a, chuongchun, hi inkhina dân ang pei hin chutaka a kawtkhâr bienghai le a tuolpûkhai chu ân khi a."
25,"And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.","Khâng tukverhai ang bawk kha, a keikul haia le chun chu- taka chun tukverhai a um a, a seizie chu tawng sâwmnga a na, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmhni panga a nih."
26,"And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.","Chun, a hang kaina dinga chun sirbi pasari a um a; a tuolpûkhai chu chuonghai hmaa chun a um a; chun, chutaka a kawtkhâr bienghai chunga chun intûm thinghai, hi tiengah pakhat, khing tiengah pakhat bawk a um a."
27,And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.,"Chun, simtieng panga chun a huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema dâi kawtkhâr chu a um a; chun, sim- tienga a dâi kawtkhâra inthawka dâi kawtkhâr chu tawng za khatin ân khi a."
28,Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;,"Chun, simtienga dâi kawtkhâra chun huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema chun a mi ṭhuoi a; hieng inkhina dân hin simtienga dâi kawtkhâr chu ân khih a;"
29,"and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.","hieng inkhina dân ang hin a vêngna pindanhai, kawtkhâr bieng- hai le tuolpûkhai chu ân khih a; chun, a vêlin a tuolpûkhai le chun tukver- hai a um a; tawng sâwmngaa sei, tawng sâwmhni pangaa lien a nih."
30,"And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.","Chun, a vêlin tuolpûkhai tawng sâwmhni pangaa sei, tawng ngaa lien a um a."
31,And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps.,"Chun, a tuolpûkhai chun huon sûng tuollai puo lem tieng a nghaa, a kawtkhâr bienghai chunga chun in- tûm thinghai an um a; a hang kainaa chun kailâwn pariet a um a."
32,And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;,"Chun, saktieng panga huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema chun a mi ṭhuoi a, chun, hieng inkhina ang pei hin dâi kawtkhâr chu ân khi a,"
33,"and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.","a vêngna pindanhai, a kawt- khâr bienghai, a tuolpûkhai chu hieng inkhina dân ang hin ân khi a; chun, a tuolpûkhaia leh a vêlin tuk- verhai an um a, tawng sâwmngaa sei, tawng sâwmhni pangaa lien a nih."
34,"And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.","A tuolpûkhai chun huon sûng tuollai puo lem tieng a ngha a, a kawtkhâr bienghaia chun, hi tieng le khing tienga khawm intûm thinghai an um a, chun a hang kaina chu sirbi pariet a nih."
35,And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured it according to these measures;,"Chun, hmâr tieng dâi kawt- khâra chun a mi ṭhuoi a; ama chun hieng inkhina dân ang hin ân khi a;"
36,"the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.","a vêngna pindanhai, a kawt- khâr bienghai, a tuolpûkhai chu; chun, chutaka chun a vêlin tukverhai a um a, a dung tieng chu tawng sâwmnga, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmhni panga a nih."
37,"And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.","Chun, kawtkhâr bienghai chu huon sûng tuollai puo lem tienga chun a na, chun, chutaka kawtkhâr bienghaia chun, hi tieng sîra le khing tieng sîra khawm chun intûm thing- hai an um a; a hang fe kaina chu sirbi pariet a nih:"
38,And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.,"Chun, dâi kawtkhârhaia kawt- khâr bienghai sîra chun pindan le kawtkhârhai an um a; chutaka chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu an sâwp hlak."
39,"And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk lûtnaa chun, hi tieng sîrah dawkân pahni, khing tieng sîrah dawkân pahni bawk, pumrawhmang thilin- hlân dâm, suol thilinhlân dâm, baw- sietna thilinhlân dâm thatna dingin a um a."
40,"And on the one side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.","Chun, hmârtieng dâi kawt- khâra lûtnaa hang feh a, sîr khat a puotienga chun, dawkân pahni a um a; chun, a sîr khata chun, dâi kawt- khâra tuolpûka ṭhangsaa chun dawkân pahni bawk a um a."
41,"Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew the sacrifices.","Hi tieng sîrah dawkân pali, khingtieng sirah dawkân pali bawk; dâi kawtkhâr sîra chun an um a; chuong dawkân pariethai chunga chun inthâwinahai chu an that hlak."
42,"And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.","Chun, pumrawhmang thilin- hlânna dingin lung a saka sak, tawng khat le a chenvea sei, tawng khat le a chenvea lien, tawng khata insâng dawkân pali an um a; chuong chunga chun inthawina le pumrawhmang thilinhlân ding an thatna ding hriemhreihai chu an sie a."
43,"And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.","Chun, in sûnga chun a vêlin kuoikimhai kutpha bawka lienhai chu inbûk an na; chun, dawkânhai chunga chun inthâwina sa chu a um a."
44,"And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr sûngril lem puoa chun a mi ṭhuoi lût a; Ngai ta, pindan pahni huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema chun an um a; hmar- tieng kawtkhâr bula chu a nghat dân chu sim sawng a na, simtieng dâi kawtkhâr sîra pakhat chu a nghat dân hmâr sawng a nih."
45,"And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Hi pindan, a nghat dân sim sawng hi in enkawl sin kawltu thiempuhai ta ding a nih."
46,"and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.","Pindan a nghat dân hmar sawng hi thiempuhai, mâichâmhai sin enkawlna kawltuhai ta ding chu a nih; chuonghai chu Zadok naupasal- hai, chuonghai chu Levi naupasalhai laia ama rawng bâwl dinga LALPA kuom hnaia hunghai chu an nih."
47,"And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.","Chun, huon sûng tuollai chu ân khih a, tawng zaa sei, tawng zaa lien, kil li inchen a nih; chun, mâichâm chu in tuola chun a um a."
48,"Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.","Chun, in tuolpûka chun a mi ṭhuoi a, tuolpûk kawtkhâr bienghai chu ân khih a, hi tieng sîrah tawng nga, khing tieng sîrah tawng nga bawk; chun, kawtkhâr khingtieng chu hi tieng sîrah tawng thum, khing tieng sîrah tawng thum bawk a nih."
49,"The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.","Chun, tuolpûk seizie chu tawng sâwmhni a na, a lien tieng chu tawng sâwmpahni a nih; chun, an hang kainaa chun sirbi sâwm a um a; chun, kawtkhâr bieng sîrhaia chun sût- puihai a um a, hi tieng sîrah pakhat, khing tieng sîrah pakhat bawk."
