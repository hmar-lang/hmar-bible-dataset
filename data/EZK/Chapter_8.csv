1,"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.","Chun, kum ruknaa thla ruknaa, chu thla ni nga ni chun, ka ina chun ka ṭhung a, ka hmaa chun Juda upahai an ṭhung laiin, Lalpa PATHIEN kut chu chutaka chun ka chunga chun a um tah a."
2,"Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.","Chun, ka en a, mei inlang anga inlang hi ka hmuh a; a kâwng le hnuoitieng inlang dân chu mei a na, a kâwng le a chungtieng inlang dân chu var ang, ṭhihna zie ang a na."
3,"And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.","Chun, kut ang tak hi a hang ban suok a, ka samtawma chun a mi man a, chuongchun, thlarau chun vân le hnuoi kâra chun a mi dawm kâng a, Pathien thil hmulâwknahai chun Jerusalemah, tuolsûng sûngril lem dâi kawtkhâr hmâr tieng sawnga chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a; chutaka chun îtthîkna milim, îtthîk dinga chawk- tho hlaktu ṭhungpha chu a um a."
4,"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.","Chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun phaia ka hmu ta ang tak khan, Israel Pathien ropuina chu a um a."
5,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, i mit khan hmâr tieng hang en rawh,” a mi tih a. Chuongchun, hmâr tieng ka mit chun ka hei en a, mâichâm kawtkhâr hmâr tieng panga chun a lûtnaah îtthîkna milim chu ka hmuh a."
6,"And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, an ithaw saw i hmu am? Hitaka hin Israel sûngkuo chun tirdakumna nasatak el an lo thaw tah a, ka hmun inthienga inthawka hlataka ka fe hmang hielna dingin; amiruokchu, tirdakumna nasa nâwk zuol chu i la hmu ding a nih,” a tih a."
7,"And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.","Chun, tuolsûng tuollai kawt- khâra chun a mi ṭhuoi a; chun, ka hei en chun, banga chun âwng ka hmu tah a."
8,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a door.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, tuhin bang kha hang ker rawh,” a ta. Chun, bang ka hei ker chun, kawtkhâr ka hmuh a."
9,"And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Va lût la, hitaka tirdakumna suoltak an thaw chu va en rawh,” a ta."
10,"So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.","Chuongchun, ka va lût a, ka va en a, ngai ta, thilhring bawka invâk chi tinrênghai, ramsa tirdakumhai le, Israel sûngkuo milimhai po po chu bang chunga chun a vêla limziekin ka hmuh a."
11,"And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.","An hmaa chun Israel sûngkuoa upahai sâwmsari an ngîr a, anni laia chun Saphan naupa Jaazania chu a ngîr a, mi tin chun an kutah rimin- hnik râwna thlêng an chawi seng a; chuongchun, riminhnik khu rim chu a hang feh a."
12,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, mi tin mâni milim pindan chitah, Israel sûngkaw upa- hai chun inthim hnuoia chun ieng am an thawh a, i hmu am? Anni chun, ‘LALPA chun a mi hmu nawh, LALPA chun hnuoi hi a nghatsan tah,’ an tih a,” tiin."
13,"He said also unto me, Thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Tirdak- umna an thaw nasatak dang khawm la hmûng i tih,” a ti bawk a."
14,"Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovah’s house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.","Chun, LALPA in dâi kawtkhâr hmârtienga uma chun a mi ṭhuoi a; chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun nuhmeihai Tammuz ṭain an lo ṭhung a."
15,"Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Aw mihriem naupa, hi hi i hmu am? Hieng nêka tirdakumna nasa lem la hmu nâwk i tih,” a ta."
16,"And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah’s house; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.","Chun, LALPA in tuollai sûngril lema chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a, chun, ngai ta, LALPA biekin kawtkhâr, mâichâm le a tuolpûk inkâra chun mi sâwmhni panga, LALPA biekin chu an hnungtieng innghata, an hmai- hai chu khawsak tieng nghain an um a; saktienga nisa chu chibai an bûk a."
17,"Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Aw mihriem naupa, hi hi i hmu am? Tirdakumna hitaka an lo thaw ta hi, Juda sûngkaw ta ding chun thil chîn tham am a nih? Ram chu inpâwngnêknain an suksip a, lung- insen dingin an mi chawktho nâwk a, en ta, an hnârah sâwlhna an sie a."
18,"Therefore will I also deal in wrath; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.","Chuleiin, kei khawma lungin- senin thaw vêng ka ta, ka mitin anni chu hla naw nih a, lunginsietna nei bawk naw ning; ka naa chun râwl inringtakin hung khêk hai sien- khawm, anni chu lo ngai naw ning,” tiin."
