1,"And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.","Kum sarina, thla ngânaa, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun, Israel upa ṭhenkhathai chu LALPA kuoma thu indawn dingin an hung a, ka hmaa chun an ṭhung a."
2,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
3,"Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Is it to inquire of me that ye are come? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.","“Mihriem naupa, Israel upahai kuoma khan thu hril la, an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih; ka kuomah thu indawn dinga hung in ni maw? Kei ka hring zing angin nangni thu indawn hin um naw ning,’ Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,"
4,"Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;","Anni chu ro rêlpêk i ti, mihriem naupa, anni chu ro rêlpêk i ti? An thlatuhai tirdakumnahai chu in- hriettir la;"
5,"and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I sware unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;","an kuoma chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; ‘Israel hi ka thlang a, Jakob sûngkaw thlahai chunga chun ka bân ka phar a, Aigupta ramah anni laia kân suk- hmêlhriet nia chun; ka bân ka phar a, LALPA in Pathien ka nih,’ tiin;"
6,"in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.","chu nia chun Aigupta rama in- thawka, ram po pohai ropuina nenetui le khuoizua luong ram an ta dinga ka lo enthlit tah rama hung ṭhuoi dingin, an kuoma chun ka bân ka phar a."
7,"And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.","An kuoma khawm chun, a mithmua tirdakumnahai po po chu nangni mi tinin peithla unla, Aigupta ram milimhai chun insukpawrche naw unla; LALPA in Pathien ka ni hi, tiin ka hril a."
8,"But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.","Nisienlakhawm, ka chungah an hel a, ka thu an ngai nawh a; mi tin chun an mithmua an tirdakumnahai chu an pei thlâk naw bawk a; Aigupta milimhai khawm chu an nghatsan bawk nawh a; chun, kei chun, ‘an chunga chun Aigupta ram sûnga an chunga ka lungsenna sukpuitling dingin ka lunginsenna chu ka bun- thlâk ding a nih,’ ka tih a;"
9,"But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.","nisienlakhawm, ka hming leiin, Aigupta rama inthawk anni hung ṭhuoi suoka an kuoma ka lo intârlang tâkna hmutu, an laia an umna hnam- hai mithmua, hrilsiet ka ni nawna dingin, ka thawh a."
10,"So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.","chuongchun, Aigupta rama inthawka suok dingin ka siem a, thlalêra chun anni chu ka hung ṭhuoi tah a."
11,"And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them.","Ka thuruothai le ka rorêlhai, chuong chu miin an thawh a, an hring pui dinghai chu, an kuomah ka pêk a, kân entir bawk a."
12,"Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them.","Chu nawa khawm, ka châwlni chu anni le keia kâra inchikna nih a, anni sukthiengtu LALPA chu ka nih ti an hriet theina dingin ka pêk bawk a."
13,"But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.","Amiruokchu, Israel sûngkuo chu thlalêra khan ka chungah an hel a, ka thuruotahai chun an fe nawh a, chuong chu miin a thawa a hringna dinghai ka rorêlhai khawm chu an dang kîr a; ka châwlni khawm chu nasatakin an suksiet a, chun, kei chun thlalêra chun anni chu kâng- hmang dingin ka lunginsenna chu an chungah ka bunthlâk ding a nih ka ti tah a."
14,"But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.","Chun, ka hming leiin, hnamhai anni mithmua anni ka hung ṭhuoi- suoknahai, chuonghai mithmua chun hrilsiet a ni ding a ni nawh tiin ka thawh a."
15,"Moreover also I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;","Chu nawa khawm, ram po pohai ropuina, nênetui le khuoizua luong anni ka lo pêk ta rama chun anni chu ka ṭhuoi lût naw ding a nih tiin thlalêra khan an kuomah ka bân ka lo phar tah a;"
16,"because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.","ka rorêlhai chu an dang kîr a, ka thuruothai chu an hraw nawh a, ka châwlnihai chu an bâwsiet ta leiin; an lungrilhai chun an milimhai chu a zui sih a."
17,"Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.","Nisienlakhawm, anni suksiet- naa inthawk chun ka mit chun a hlah a, thlalêra khan anni chu ka lo suktâwp dêr el bawk nawh a."
18,"And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.","Chun, an thlahai kuomah thla- lêra khan, ‘In thlatuhai thuruothai chu hraw naw unla, an rorêlhai chu pawm bawk naw unla, an milimhai chun nangni le nangni insukpawrche bawk naw ro;"
19,"I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;","LALPA in Pathien chu kei ka na, ka thuruothai chu hraw unla, ka rorêlhai chu pawm unla, thaw ro;"
20,"and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.","ka châwlni khawm chu inza bawk unla; LALPA in Pathien ka nih ti in hriet theina dingin nangni le keia inkâra inchikna nîng a tih,’ tiin."
21,"But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong thlahai chu ka chungah an hel ta rawp a, ka thuruothai chu an hraw nawh a, ka rorêlhai khawm chu thaw dingin an zâwm bawk nawh a; chuong chu miin a thaw chun chuonga chun hring a tih; ka châwlni khawm an sukpawr- cheh a; chun, kei chun thlalêra an chunga ka lunginsenna chu sukpui- tling dingin an chunga chun ka lunginsenna chu ka bunthlâk ding a nih ka tih a."
22,"Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.","Nisienlakhawm, an mithmua anni ka hung ṭhuoi suokna hnamhai mithmua chun sukhmingsiet a ni nawna dingin, ka hming leiin ka thawh a, ka kut chu ka keitîm tah a."
23,"Moreover I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;","Chu nawa khawm chu ram hran hranhaia chun hnawt dar ka ta, hnamhai laia chun anni chu ka sukdar ding a nih tiin thlalêra khan an kuomah ka bân chu ka phar a;"
24,"because they had not executed mine ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.","ka rorêlhai chu an phursuok nawh a, ka thuruothai khawm an dangkîr bawk leiin le, ka châwlnihai khawm chu an sukpawrcheh a, an thlatuhai milimhai chu an mit chun a en zing leiin."
25,"Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live;","Chu nawa khawm chun thuruot a ṭha ni lo, rorêlnahai an hringna ding ni lohai khawm chu ka pêk bawk a;"
26,"and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.","chun, anni thilpêkhaia ngei, sul hung hawngtu taphawt meia an infethlengtirnaa chun, anni chu râusana ka siem theina ding le, a tâwpa chun LALPA ka nih ti an mi hriet theina dingin anni chu ka sukpawrcheh a."
27,"Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.","“Chuleiin, mihriem naupa, Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun thu hril la, an kuomah Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih ti rawh: In thlatuhai chun hitaka hin an mi lo demsiet tah a, ka chunga an lo bâwsietnaa hin."
28,"For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings.","Ka bân phara anni pe dinga ka ti, chu rama anni ka hung ṭhuoi lai chun tlâng insângtak le rampui inthim mup an hmuh a, chutaka chun an inthâwina chu an inhlân tah a, chutaka chun an thilinhlân chimum chu an pêk a, chutaka chun an rim- inhnik khawm chu an bun bawk a."
29,"Then I said unto them, What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go? So the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.","Chun, keiin an kuomah, ‘In va fena bâwlhmun kha ieng am in tih a?’ ka tih a. Chuongchun, a hminga chun vawisûn ni chen hin Bama an inbûk tah a."
30,"Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Do ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play ye the harlot after their abominations?","Chuleiin, Israel sûngkuohai kuoma chun hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: In thlatuhai thaw dân ang bawkin nangni le nangni in insukpawrche ding a ni maw? An tirdakumna chu châkin in zâwm ve ding a ni maw?"
31,"and when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you;","In thilpêkhai in inhlân lai le, in naupasalhai chu meia in infethleng- tir lai khan, in milimhaia khan vawi- sûn ni chen hin in insukpawrche a ni nâwm a nih? Aw Israel sûngkuo, nangni mi râwn hin ka um rawp ding maw? Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih, nangni irâwn hin chu um ta naw ningah."
32,"and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.","“In lungrila in ingaituo, ‘Thing le lung rawng bâwl dinga rambung- haia sûngkuohai le hnamhai ang nîng ei ta’ in ti ang kha hung ni tawp naw ti niu."
33,"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, will I be king over you.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun ka hring zing angin, kut hrâttak le, bân phar le lunginsenna bunthlâkin in chungah lal nîng ka ta,"
34,"And I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;","hnam danghai laia inthawkin la suok ka ti cheu a, sukdara in umna ramhaia inthawk khan kut tha hrât le, bân phar le lunginsenna bunthla hielin kei khâwm ka ti cheu;"
35,"and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.","chun, hnamhai thlalêra chun hung ṭhuoi ka ti cheu a, chutaka chun hmai san ngeiah phût tâng ka ti cheu."
36,"Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.","In thlatuhai Aigupta ram thla- lêra ka phût ang khan, nangni khawm ka phût ding cheu a nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
37,"And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;","Chun, vuokfung hnuoiah infetir ka ti cheu a, thuthlung khuokhirna hnuoiah lalût ka ti cheu;"
38,"and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","nangni laia inthawkin mi helhai chu sukfai ka ta, chuong keia chunga bâwsetuhai le chun; an mikhuolna rama inthawk chun hung ṭhuoi suok ka tih; amiruokchu, Israel rama chun chu lût naw ni hai; chun, LALPA chu ka nih, ti mi hre tâng in tih."
39,"As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me; but my holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols.","Nangni ta ding chun, Aw Israel sûngkuo, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Fe unla, ka thu in ngai si naw ding chun mi tinin tuhin le hi hnunga khawm, a milimhai rawng chu va bâwl el raw se chu; amiruokchu, ka hming inthieng chu in thilpêkhai le in milimhai chun sukhmingsie ngai ta naw ti niu."
40,"For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih: Ka tlâng inthieng, Israel tlâng insânga chun Israel sûngkuohai po po chu, an rêngin chu rama chun ka rawng bâwl tâng an ta, chutaka chun anni chu lâwm ka ta, chutaka chun in thilin- hlânhai chu, in rahmasa inthâwi- nahai le in thil inthienghai po po le chun pawimawsak tâng ka tih."
41,"As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.","Hnamhai laia inthawka ka hung ṭhuoi suok pha cheu a, sukdara in umna ramhaia inthawka ka kei khâwm pha cheu chun riminhnik angin lâwm tâng ka ti cheu a, hnam- hai mithmua ngei chun nangni chu sukthieng tâng ka ti cheu."
42,"And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I sware to give unto your fathers.","Chun, in thlatuhai kuoma pêk dinga ka bân ka lo phar tah, chu ram, Israel rama chun ka hung ṭhuoi pha cheu chun LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in ta;"
43,"And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.","chutaka chun, in lampuihai le in thilthawhai po po, in lo insuk- pawrchenahai chu hre zing in tih; chun, in suolnahai po po, in lo suksuol tahaia chun in mithmu ngeia chun nangni le nangni intheida tâng in tih."
44,"And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, in lampui suolhai ang ni loa, in thilthaw khawhlohai ang khawm ni loa, ka hming leia nangni le sin ka thaw pha chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih, Aw Israel sûngkuo, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
45,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a."
46,"Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South;","“Mihriem naupa, i hmai kha simtieng innghat la, i thu chu sim- tienga chun inthla la, Sim rama phûl rampui chunga chun thu hril rawh;"
47,"and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burnt thereby.","chun, Sim rampui kuoma chun, ‘LALPA thu hi lo ngai la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih: Ngai ta, i sûnga hin mei sêm ka ta, i sûnga thing hring tinrênghai chu kâng hmang a tih, thing ṭâwl tinhai le chun, chun, meichawk lai mei chu rêm el naw nih a, simtienga inthawka hmârtieng pang po po kâng a tih."
48,"And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.","Chun, tisa tin chun kei LALPA hin ka sêm a nih ti hmûng an ta; thimit el naw ni,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
49,"Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Is he not a speaker of parables?","Chun, kei chun, “E, Lalpa PATHIEN! Ama hi tekhithu hriltu a nih an nâwm a nih? an mi ti el a nih,” ka ta."
