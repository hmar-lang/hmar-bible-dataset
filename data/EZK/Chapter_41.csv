1,"And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.","Chun, ama chun Pathien biek ina chun a mi ṭhuoi a, chun, kawtkhâr bieng chu ân khi a, hi tieng sîrah tawng ruka lien a na, khing tieng sîra khawm tawng ruka lien bawk a nih; chu chu biekbûk khang tieng ruol a nih."
2,"And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.","A lûtna khang tieng chu tawng sâwm a na; lûtna sîr chu sîr khatah tawng nga a na, sîr danga khawm tawng nga bawk a nih; chun, chu dung tieng chu tawng sâwmliin ân khi a, a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmhniin."
3,"Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.","Chun, a sûngah a lût a, lûtna kawtkhâr bieng chu tawng hniin ân khi a; a lûtna chu tawng rukin; a lûtna khang tieng chu tawng sariin."
4,"And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.","Chun, pindan chu ân khi a, a dung tieng chu tawng sâwmhniin ân khi a, a khang tieng khawm tawng sâwmhni bawkin; chun, ka kuoma chun, “Hi hi hmun inthiengtak chu a nih,” a ta."
5,"Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.","Chun, in bang chu ân khi a, tawng ruk a na, sîr tinah a in vêl chun, pindan kêmhai khang tieng chu tawng li pei a na."
6,"And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold therein, and not have hold in the wall of the house.","A sîr pindanhai chu pathum a na, pakhat chungah a dang, chuong ang peia sâwmthum chena indawt peiin; Inpui banga chun inbûkna nei loa, chutaka chun inbûkna an nei thei lemna dingin, a vêla pindan kêmhai ta ding hrima ruot inpui banga filawrhaia chun an vân bûk a."
7,And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed the house higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house continued upward; and so one went up from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.,"Pindan kêmhai chun in chu an vêl sâng deu deu chun an lien deu deu a; in sîr vêl chun a pindan inzâwnpui ang peiin a lien tung pei a; chuong- chun, in vêlin a sûngpui chu a chin deu deu pei a, in sîra chun leilâk a fe tung pei a; chuongchun, mi chun pindan hnuoihnung taka inthawka a chunghnung taka chun pindan lai- lung hraw tlangin a fe a nih."
8,I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.,"Chun, in chun a vêlin a rei sukkho a nei ka hmu bawk a; chun, pindan kêmhai lungphûmhai chu luonghmawl tling tawng ruk a nih."
9,"The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.","Chun, pindan kêmhai bang sazie chu a puotiengah tawng nga a nih; chun, chutaka la mahla chu pindan kêmhai a sûnga umhai sîr thlâk chu a la nih."
10,And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.,"Chun, inpui lungrem le pindan kêmhai inkâr chu sîr tinah a in vêl suokin, tawng sâwmhnia lien a um a."
11,"And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.","Chun, pindan kêmhai kawt- khârhai chu chu hmun la âwl tieng- haia chun hawng a na, kawtkhâr pakhat chu hmârtiengah, kawtkhâr dang chu simtiengah; chun, chu hmun la chuonga ngai khang tieng chu tawng nga a nih a vêlin."
12,"And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.","Chun, in thlangtieng panga hmun âwl hmaa in chu tawng sâwm- saria lien a na; chun, chu in chu a bang sazie chu a vêlin tawng ngaa sa a nih, a dung tieng chu tawng sâwm- kuo a nih."
13,"So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;","Chun, in chu tawng zaa seiin ân khi a; chun, hmun daidana um le a in le, chutaka banghai le chun tawng za chu a nih;"
14,"also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.","chun, in hmai khang tieng saktieng panga hmun âwla um chu tawng za a nih."
15,"And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;","Chun, chu hnungtienga um hmun âwla in seizie chu ân khi a; chutaka a dawdanhai le, sîr khat le sîr khingtienga dawdanhai le chun tawng za a nih; chun, biekin sûngril lem, huon sûng tuollaia tuolpûkhai, a kawtkhâr bienghai, thingphêka in- thuo a na;"
16,"the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows (now the windows were covered),","a tukver inkhâr zinghai, a sâwng thuma a dawdanhai a vêlin a um a; a inpui kawt lûtnaa inthawk, a vêla thingphêka remin ṭuonga in- thawka tukver chen rem a nih;"
17,"to the space above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.","chuongchun, tukverhai chu in- thuo an na; kawtkhâr lu chung hmun, in sûngril lem le puo lem, a vêlin a puo le sûngah banghai chun, inkhi thlapa inkhum a nih."
18,"And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;","Chun, cherubhai le intûm thinghaia chei a na; intûm thing chu cherub le cherub inkâra chun a um a, chun, cherubhai chun hmai pahni seng an nei a;"
19,"so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. Thus was it made through all the house round about:","chuongchun, sîr khata chun in- tûm thing tieng chun mihriem hmai chu a nghah a, chun, sîr khingtienga chun intûm thing tieng ngha ma chun sakeibaknei tuoi hmai chu a ngha a; in chu a vêlin chuong ang taka siem suok vawng chu a nih."
20,from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made; thus was the wall of the temple.,Hnuoia inthawka kawtkhâr lu chung chen chun cherubhai le intûm thinghaia siem a na; biekin bang chu chuong ang chu a nih.
21,"As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance thereof was as the appearance of the temple.","Biekin thua chun, a kawtkhâr bienghai chu kil li nei an na; chun, hmun inthieng tak hmaa chun, thinga siem mâichâm ang a um a."
22,"The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.","Chun, mâichâm chu thing a na, ân sâng tieng chu tawng thum a na, a sei tieng chu tawng hni a nih; a kihai le, a mawnghai le a banghai chu thing ruok a nih; chun, ama chun ka kuom- ah, “Hi hi LALPA hmaa dawkân chu a nih,” a tih a."
23,And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.,"Chun, biekin le hmun inthieng tak chun kawtkhâr pahni a nei a."
24,"And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves: two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other.","Kawtkhârhai chun, phêk hran pahni, phêk hni inthlep a nei a, kawtkhâr pakhat ta dingin, phêk hni, kawtkhâr dang ta dingin phêk hni bawk."
25,"And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without.","Chun, an chunga chun, biekin sûtpui kawtkhârhaia chun cherubhai le intûm thinghai lim siem an na, bang chunghaia siem ang bawk khan; chun, tuolpûk puotieng hmaa chun thingpum lientak tak a um a."
26,"And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.","Chun, tukver inkhârhai le, tuol- pûka chun sîr khata le sîr khing- tienga khawm chun intûm thinghai chu an um a; pindan kêmhai le thing- phêk satakhai chu chuong ang chu a nih."
