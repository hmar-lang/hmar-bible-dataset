2,"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.","chun, ngai ta, saktienga inthawk chun Israel Pathien ropuina chu a hung tlung tah a; chun, a râwl khawm chu tui tamtak ri ang a nih; chuongchun, a ropuina chun hnuoi chu a var tah a."
3,"And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.","Chun, thilhmulâwk ka ihmu tah, khawpui chu sukse dinga a hung laia thilhmulâwk ka hmu ang tak, chu thil hmulâwk chu Kebar vadung panga thilhmulâwk ka hmu ang kha a nih; chuongchun, ka hmaiin hnuoi ka sik tah a."
4,And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.,"Chun, dâi kawtkhâr, saktieng nghaa inthawk chun LALPA ropuina chu ina chun a hung lût a;"
5,"And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.","Thlarau chun a mi dawm kâng a, huon sûng tuollai sungril lema chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a; chun, ngai ta, LALPA ropuina chun in chu a suksip tah a."
6,And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me.,"Mi pakhat ka sîra a ngîr zing lai chun, ina inthawk chun mi pakhat hin ka kuomah thu hrilin ka hriet a;"
7,"And he said unto me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places;","ka kuoma chun, “Mihriem naupa, hi hi ka lalṭhungpha hmun le ka kehai innghatna hmun, Israel thla- hai kuoma chatuona ka chêngna ding chu a ni hi. Israel sûngkuo chun ka hming inthieng chu sukpawrche ta naw ni hai a, anni khawmin, an lalhai khawm, an hurnain amani, an bâwlhmunhaia an lalhai ruonghai khawmin amanih sukpawrche naw ni hai,"
8,"in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was but the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.","an tuolpûk chu ka tuolpûk kâwla siein, an kawtkhâr bieng chu ka kawtkhâr bieng sîrah, anni le keia kâra chun bang chau a uma chu; an tirdakumna an lo thaw tahai chun ka hming inthieng chu an lo sukpawrche tah a; chuleiin, ka lunginsenna chun anni chu ka kâng hmang tah a."
9,"Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.","Tuhin an hurna le an lalhai ruonghai chu keimaa inthawka hla- takah sie hmang hai sienla, anni lai chun chatuonin chêng tâng ka tih."
10,"Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.","“Nang mihriem naupa, Israel sûngkaw kuoma chun in kha inentir rawh, an suolhai leia an inzak theina dingin; chuongchun, a riruong kha inkhitir rawh."
11,"And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the egresses thereof, and the entrances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.","Chun, an thil lo thaw tahai po po kha an inzâpui a ni chun in riruong, a hmêlput dân, a fe suokna, a lûtna, a hmêl umziehai po po le chutaka dânhai po po leh inhriettir la, an mithmu ngeia chun ziek la, chu chu hmêl put dân po po chu an vawng zinga, dânhai po po khawm chu an kawla an zâwm theina dingin."
12,"This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.","Hi hi in dân chu nîng a tih; tlâng sîp chunga a huop chin chin chu hmun inthiengtak nîng a ta; Ngai ta, hi hi in dân chu nîng a tih."
13,"And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.","“Chun, hieng hi tawnga inkhia mâichâm lienzie chu a nih; (tawng chu tawng le kutpha bawk a nih) a mawng chu tawng khat nîng a ta, a khang tieng khawm tawng khat bawk; a rei sira a tlâng chu a vêlin khâp khat nîng a ta, hi hi mâichâm mawng chu nîng a tih."
14,"And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.","Chun, hnuoi ân ṭhutnaa in- thawk chun a rei hnuoihnung lem chen chun tawng hni nîng a ta, a khang tieng chu tawng khat; chun, a rei chîn lema inthawka a rei lien lem chen chu tawng li nîng a tih, chun, a khang tieng chu tawng khat."
15,And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.,Mâichâm chunghnung lem chu tawng li nîng a ta; mâichâm thuk le a chung tienga chun kihai pali um a ta.
16,"And the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.","Mâichâm thuk chu tawng sawmpahnia sei, tawng sâwmpahni maa lien nîng a tih, a sîr palia chun intiet seng nîng a tih."
17,And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.,"A sîrhai pali chun a rei chu tawng sâwmpalia sei a, tawng sâwm- pali maa lien nîng a tih; a tlâng chu a vêlin tawng chenve nîng a ta; chu mawng chu tawng khat lai ni bawk a ta; a sirbihai chu saktieng nghâng a tih."
18,"And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.","Chun, ka kuomah a hril a, “Mi- hriem naupa, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: A chunga pum- rawhmang thilinhlân an inhlân a, thisen a chunga an the ni chun, hieng hi mâichâm thuthlunghai chu nîng a tih."
19,"Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.","Levi mi thiempuhai, Zadok thlaa mi ngei chu, keia rawngbâwl dinga kei a mi hnaihai kuoma chun suol thilinhlâna dingin bâwngchal tuoi pêng i tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
20,"And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.","Chun, chu thisen chu lâng i ta, a kihai pali chun nâl i ta, a rei ki lia le, a tlâng a sîrvêl poa hai le chun; chuongchun, sukthieng i ta, ama ta ding chun intlanna siem i tih."
21,"Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.","Suol thilinhlân dinga bâwng- chal khawm chu lâng i ta, chu ina hmun ruot hmun inthieng tuola chun râwng i tih."
22,"And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.","Chun, a ni hni nia chun suol thilinhlân ding chun kêlchal dem- kailo inhlân i tih; bawngchal hmanga mâichâm sukthieng a ni ang bawk khan, mâichâm chu sukthieng nîng a tih."
23,"When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.","Chun, sukthiengna thil chu i thaw zo pha chun bâwngchal tuoi demkailo le, a ruol laia berâmchal demkailo chu inhlân i tih."
24,"And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.","Chun, nang chun LALPA kuom- ah hung ṭhuoi i ta, thiempuhai chun an chunga chun chi lo thêng an ta, chuongchun, LALPA kuomah pum- rawhmang thilinhlân dingin inhlân an tih."
25,"Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.","Ni sari sûng chu ni tin, suol thilinhlân dingin kêl buotsai i ta; chun, bâwngchal tuoi le berâmchal a ruol laia mi demkailo i buotsai bawk ding a nih."
26,Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.,"Ni sari sûng chu mâichâm ta ding chun intlanna siempêk an ta, sukthieng an tih, chuongchun, hlân- thieng an tih."
27,"And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, nihai chu an hmang zo pha, ni rietnaa inthawk chu, thiem- puhai chun in pumrawhmang thilin- hlânhai chu mâichâma chun thâwng an ta, in inremna thilinhlânhai le chun; chuongchun, lo pawm ka ti cheu, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
