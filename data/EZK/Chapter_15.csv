verse_no,en,hmr
1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a."
2,"Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?","“Mihriem naupa, grêphrui kûng, grêp hrui kâu ramhnuoi thing laia um ve bawk chu, thing dang nêkin ieng am a danglam bikna?"
3,Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?,"Sin ieng ang khawm thawna dingin chutaka inthawk chun thing lâk suok thei a ni ding am a nih? Annawleh, mihaiin bûr le bêl, khaina dingin a kâute an lâk ding am a nih?"
4,"Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work?","Ngai ta, thing tiha hmang dingin meia peilût a nih, a hmawr ve ve chu mei chun a kâng hmang a, a lai chu a hung kâng a; sin ieng ding khawma a ṭhahnem am a nih?"
5,"Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!","Ngai ta, a pumpuia a um lai khawma ieng sina ding khawma a tlâktlai naw a, meiin a kâng hmang zo hnung lem chun a va tlâktlai naw nasa âwmin, a kâng hnung chun sin ieng dingin am tlâktlai tâng a ta!"
6,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Grêphrui thing chu ramhnuoia thing danghai laia meia ti dinga ka pêk angin; chuong ang bawk chun Jerusalem hluotuhai chu pêng ka tih."
7,"And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.","An chunga chun ka hmai innghat ka ta; meia inthawk chun fe suok sienkhawm mei bawkin anni chu kânghmang a tih; chun, chuonga anni chu ka hmai kân nghat pha chun LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
8,"And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, bawsietna thil chu an thaw leiin, ram chu râusanah siem ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
