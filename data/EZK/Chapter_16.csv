1,"Again the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a,"
2,"Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations;","“Mihriem naupa, Jerusalem chu a tirdakumna chu hre dingin siem la,"
3,"and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun Jerusalem kuomah hieng ang hin a tih, ti rawh; ‘I piengna le i hnam ram chu Kanaan mihai ram a na; Amor mi chu i pa a na; Hit mi chu i nu a nih."
4,"And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.","I pieng dâna chun, i pieng ni chun i laihrui chu ât a ni nawh a, nang chu sukfai ding chein tuia sâwp khawm i ni bawk nawh a; chia saw hrim khawm i ni nawh a, dawm khawm i ni bawk nawh a."
5,"No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, for that thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou wast born.","I chunga lunginsietna nei dingin le, hieng thilhai hi thawpêk ding chein, tu mit khawma a lunginsiet naw cheh a; amiruokchu, khaw- hnâwmah hnawt suok i ni ta lem a; chuong ang chun i pieng ni chun i mi nina chu tenin a lo um tah a."
6,"And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said unto thee, Though thou art in thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, Though thou art in thy blood, live.","Chun, i sîra ka khêl lai a, i thi- sena insukpawrche vawnga ka hmu chein, i kuoma chun, “I thisena khânga um kha ni la khawm, dam rawh,” ka tih a."
7,"I caused thee to multiply as that which groweth in the field, and thou didst increase and wax great, and thou attainedst to excellent ornament; thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare.","Ramhnuoi hnader anga pung dingin ka siem cheh a, i hung pung ngei a, i hung ropui a, incheina ṭha bîktak ang chu i hung ni tah a; i nênehai a hung in siem a, i sam dâm khawm a hung ṭo a, amiruokchu, saruok le ruok i la ni tlat el a."
8,"Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mine.","Chun, i sîr ka hung khêl a, ka hung en che chun, ngai ta, i hun chu hmangaina hun a ni tah a; ka puon chu i chunga chun ka keiphar a, i saruokna chu kân khum tah a; anih, i kuoma chun kân khâm a, nangma le chun thuthlung ka lo siem tah a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; chun, ka ta i hung ni tah a."
9,"Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.","Chun, tuiin kân sil cheh a; anih, i thisen chu nangmaa inthawk chun ka sâwpfai vawng a, hriek ka nâl cheh a."
10,"I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.","Puon cheimawiin kân thuom cheh a, seal vun kekawk kân buntir cheh a, puon zai inhmiin ka hrên cheh a, tuktulungêk puonin ka tuom che kha."
11,"And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.","Incheina thuomhaiin ka chei cheh a, i kuta chun bânbunhai kân buntir cheh a, i rîngah khaidiet leh."
12,"And I put a ring upon thy nose, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.","Chun, i hnârah hnârbê le, i na- haia chun nabêhai le, i lu chungah lukhum mawitak ka sieh a."
13,"Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper unto royal estate.","Chuongchun, rângkachak le tangkaruoa cheiin i um a; i silfênhai khawm, puon zai inhmi dâm, tuktu- lungêk puon dâm le puon cheimawi dâm an nih; beiphit indîtak le khuoizu le hriek chu i fâk a; i hung hmêlṭha êm êm el a; chun, lalnu khawm chu i hung tling pei tah a."
14,"And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.","I mawina leiin i hming chu hnamhai laia chun ân darsuok a; kân lalna leia i chunga ka lo sie ta chu, ṭhat famkimna a ni sih a.’ Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
15,"But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by; his it was.","“Nisienlakhawm, i hmêl ṭhatna chu i ring a, i hming inthangna lei chun nawchizawrah i um tah a; nang- ma hung khêltu taphawthai chunga chun i châkna chu i phal a; ama ta a ni tah a."
16,"And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places decked with divers colors, and playedst the harlot upon them: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.","I silfênhai chu i lâk a, i bâwl- hmunhai chu ze dang dangin i chei a; a chunga chun nawchizawrna thil chu i thaw tah a; chuong ang thil chu um nâwk ta ngai naw nih a, chuong ang chu a la ni ngai bawk nawh."
17,"Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them;","Ka rângkachak le ka tangka în cheina hluhai ka pêkhai che chu i lâk a, mihriemhai limhaia chun i siem a, anni le chun nawchizawrna thil chu i thaw tah a;"
18,"and thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.","i puon cheimawihai chu i lâk a, anni chu în khum a; an hmaa chun ka sahriekhai le riminhnikhai chu în tung a;"
19,"My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor; and thus it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.","ka bei ka ipêk che, beiphit indî- tak, hriek le khuoizu leh, ka châwm- na che chu, an hmaa chun riminhnika dingin i sie ve bawk a, chuong chu a nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
20,"Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,","Chu nawa khawm chun, naunu- hmeihai le naupasalhai i mi nei- pêkhai chu i lâk a, an kuomahai chun fâkzoa um dingin inthâwinain i hmang a."
21,"that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire unto them?","I nawchizawrna chu thil chîn tham a ni ding maw? Ka nauhai i that a, meia infethlengtir dinga an kuoma i pêk hi!"
22,"And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in thy blood.","I nawchizawrna le i tirdakum- nahai poa hin i tleirâwl lai nihai, saruok le ruoka i um a, i thisena în sukpawrche lai kha i hriet zing ta naw a nih."
23,"And it is come to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Jehovah),","“Chun, i rîtlona po po hnunga chun (i chung a rik, i chung a rik! Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih),"
24,"that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street.","hmun langsârtak takhai chu i ta dingin i bâwl a, kawtthlêr tinahai chun hmun insângtakhai chu i ta dingin i siem tah a."
25,"Thou hast built thy lofty place at the head of every way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom.","Lam tluongpui tinahai chun i hmun insânghai chu i bâwl a, i mawi- na chu tirdakumnain în changtir a, mi a hung khêl taphawt che kuoma chun în hlîm a, i hurna chu i sukpung tah a."
26,"Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger.","I tuolbâwm, tisa ropuina, Aigupta mi le khawm chun i lo uire tah a; lunginsennaa mi chophâwk dingin i hurna chu i sukpung tah a."
27,"Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way.","Chuleichun, ngai ta, i chungah ka kut kân let a, i bu pângngai chu ka suktlâwm ding a nih, chun, Philistin naunuhai, i lampui tirdakum inza- puituhai, nangma theidatuhai duthu- sâmah pe suok ka ti che."
28,"Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied.","Mumal boa i um lei khan Assuria mihai kuoma khawm naw- chizawrah i lo insiem tah a; anih, an kuoma chun nawchizawr thil chu i lo thawa chu i lungawi tâwk si nawh a."
29,"Thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.","Chu nawa khawm chun Kanaan rama chun, Kaldai ram chenin i hurna chu i sukpung a; anâhlakchu chu khawm chun i la lungawi tâwk nawh a."
30,"How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an impudent harlot;","Hieng thil, nuhmei châk tawm tawmhai sin i thaw hi hmuin, ‘I lungril chu a va khawhlo de!’ Lalpa PATHIEN chun a ti a nih."
31,"in that thou buildest thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street, and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire.","Lampui tluong tinahai chun i hmun langsârhai chu i bâwl a, kawt- thlêr tinahai chun i hmun insânghai chu i siem bawk a; hawman khawm i lâk nawnaa hin nawchizawr el ang khawm i ni nawh."
32,A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband!,"Nuhmei uirenu, mâni pasal nêka mikhuolhai la lemtu!"
33,"They give gifts to all harlots; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms.","Nawchizawrhai po po kuoma chun miin thilpêkhai an pêk hlak a, nang ruok chu i hmangaihai po po chu thilpêkhai i pêk a, anni chu i tham a, i châknaa ding chun sîr tina nangma kuoma an hung theina dingin."
34,"And thou art different from other women in thy whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to play the harlot; and whereas thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, therefore thou art different.","I châknaa hin nuhmei danghai nêka danglamna a um a, nang chu mi tukhawma châkna ang thaw dingin an hung zui naw chea hin; nang chun hâwman chu i pêk lem a, nangma kuoma chun hawman chu pêk a ni nawh a, chuleiin, i danglam a nih."
35,"Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:","“Chuleiin, aw nang nawchi- zawr, LALPA thu chu lo hre rawh:"
36,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them;","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih; i hmangaituhai kuoma i châkna zâra chun i saruokna chu hmusuok a na, i tirdakumna chu bunsuok a ni bawk lei le; i pawrchena milimhai po po le, an kuoma i lo pêk tah i nauhai thisen po po lei chun,"
37,"therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee on every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.","ngai ta, chuleichun, i hmangai- hai po po chu ko khâwm ka ta, inhawi i lo chênpuihai po po le, i lo hmangai tahai po po le, i lo theida tahai po po le chun, kil tina inthawkin, i chungah hung ṭhuoi khâwm ka ta, i saruokna po pohai chu an hmu theina dingin an kuoma chun i saruokna chu hâwk ka tih."
38,"And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy.","Chun, nuhmei inneina dân baw- se le, mâni nau thisen insuo chunga rorêl angin i chungah rorêl ka tih; i chunga chun îtthîkna le lunginsenna thisen chu hung intlungtir ka tih."
39,"I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare.","Chun, anni kuta chun pe bawk ka ti cheh a, i hmun langsârhai chu peisieng an ta, i hmun insânghai chu sukchim an tih; i puon sil chu hlîppêk an ti cheh a, în cheina thil hluhai chu lâng an tih; chuongchun, saruok le ruokin mâksan an ti che."
40,"They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.","Nangma chunga chun in- khâwmpuina nei bawk an ta, lung- haiin dêng an ti cheh a, an kâwl- hnâmhaiin sunthleng bawk an ti che."
41,"And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more.","I inhai chu meiin râwng an ta, nuhmei tamtak mithmua chun i chunga rorêlna chu sukthlûng an ta; chun, nawchizawr anga um chu ma dingin siem ka ti cheh a, chun, hawman khawm pe ta ngai hrim hrim naw ti ni."
42,"So will I cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.","Chuongchun, ka lunginthakna chu i chungah hrîtthlâng ka ta, ka îtthîkna chu nangmaa inthawk chun fe hmang tâng a ta, to ṭawk ṭawk ka ta, lunginsen nâwk ta naw ningah."
43,"Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations.","I tleirâwl lai nihai kha i hriet zing ta nawh a, amiruokchu, hieng thilhaia hin i mi suklungsen a; chuleiin, ngai ta, kei khawma i nun suol maw chu i lu chungah hung intlungtir ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; chun, pawrchenahai po po belsain hi khawhlona hi thaw ta naw ti nih."
44,"Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.","“Ngai ta, mi tukhawm thuvar- hai hmangtu chun hi thuvar hi i chungah hung hmang an tih, ‘A naunu khawm a nu ang bawk,’ ti hi."
45,"Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.","Nang chu i nu naunu, a nauhai le a pasal khawm dawnsaklo naunu chu i na, nang chu i zuorpuihai, mâni nauhai le pasalhai khawm dawn- saklohai unaunu chu i na; in nu chu Hit mi a na, in pa khawm Amor mi a nih."
46,"And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.","I zuorpui upa lem le a naunu- hmeihai chu i vawitienga chêng Samaria hi a na; chun, i zuorpui naupang lem i changtienga chêng chu Sodom le a naunuhmeihai hi an nih."
47,"Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways.","An lampuihai chu i hrawin, an tirdakumnahaia chun i lungawi tâwk nawh a; amiruokchu, hun sâwt nawtê sûngin i um dân po poah anni nêk hmanin i se lem a."
48,"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.","Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih, ‘nang le i nau- nuhaiin, nangin i thaw angin i zuor- pui Sodom chun amanih, a naunu khawmin amani khawm a thaw nawh a."
49,"Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.","Ngai ta, hi hi i zuorpui Sodom suolna chu a nih; ama le a naunuhaia chun chapona, bei ditkhawp, hausaka inhawitirna a um a, mi tlasamhai le mi rimsihai chu a ṭhangpui chuong nawh."
50,"And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.","An chapo a, ka hmaa chun tirdakumna an thawh a, chuleiin, ṭha ka ti ang peiin anni chu ka lâk hmang tah a."
51,"Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.","Samaria khawm chun i suol zâtve khawm a thaw nawh a, nang ruok chun anni nêkin i tirdakumna chu i sukpung nasa lem a, chuleiin, tirdakumna i thawhai po po chun i zuorpuihai chu felah în langtir tah a nih."
52,"Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.","I zuorpuihai fel lema în lang- tirna hin nang ngeiin i muolphona chu phur rawh, anni nêka tirdakum- na nasa lem thawha i suolnahai leiin anni chu nanga nêkin an fel lem a nih, i zuorpuihai chu fel lema în langtir leiin."
53,"And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;","“An sal nina chu inlet ka ta, Sodom le a naunuhmeihai sal nina, Samaria le a naunuhmeihai sal nina le, anni laia i salhai sal nina khawm inlet ka tih,"
54,"that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.","an ta dinga thlamuongtu nia i thil lo thaw tahai po poa khan în zak a, i muolphona chu i phur theina dingin."
55,"And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.","I zuorpuihai Sodom le a nau- nuhmeihai le Samaria le a naunu- hmeihai chu an um dân hmasaa bawk kîr nâwk an ta, nang le i naunu- hmeihai khawm in um dân hmasaa bawk kîr nâwk in tih."
56,"For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,","I chapo ni khan i zuorpuinu Sodom chu i ṭawngse hnâwkna ni lo am a nih,"
57,"before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite unto thee round about.","i rîtlona suklang a ni hma khan? Tuhin amanu angin Suria naunu- hmeihai le a vêla umhai po po le, Philistin naunuhai i kîmvêla hmu- sittuhai che hrilsiet i hung ni ta hi."
58,"Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah.","I hurna le i tirdakumna hremna chu i phur a nih, LALPAIN a tih."
59,"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: thuthlung bawsea, inkhâm- na hmusita nangin i lo thaw ta ang khan nanga chunga khawm thâwng ka tih."
60,"Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.","Nisienlakhawm, i tleirâwl lai nihaia nang le ka thuthlung chu hre zing ka ta; chun, nang le chun cha- tuon thuthlung indin ka tih."
61,"Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder sisters and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.","I unauhai, i unu le i sangnu i pawmlût pha chun naunuhmeihai dingin anni chu i kuomah pêng ka tih, i thuthlung lei ruok chu ni loin."
62,And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah;,"Chun, ka thuthlung chu nang leh sukdet ka tih, chun LALPA ka nih ti mi hre tâng i tih."
63,"that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Thil i lo thawtahai po poa ka ngaidam pha che chun i hriet zing a, i hmai a mâwk a, în zak leia i bau i kâk dêr ta nawna dingin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
