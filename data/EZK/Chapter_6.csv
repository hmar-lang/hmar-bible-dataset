1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
2,"Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy unto them,","“Mihriem naupa, i hmai kha Israel tlâng tiengahai sawn innghat la, an kuomah thu hril la,"
3,"and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.","‘Nangni Israel tlânghai, Lalpa PATHIEN thu chu lo ngai ta u, Lalpa PATHIEN chun tlânghai le muol- hai le, tui luongnahai le, phairuom- hai kuoma chun hieng ang hin a tih; Ngai ta u, keiin, keima ngeiin, in chungah kâwlhnâm intlungtir ka ta, in bâwlhmunhai sukse vawng ka tih."
4,"And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.","In mâichâmhai chu râusan hung nîng an ta, in nisa milimhai khawm chu suktliek nîng a ta, in mi thathai chu in milimhai hmaa chun hung pei thlâng ka tih."
5,And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.,"Chun, Israel thlahai thiruonghai chu an milimhai hmaa chun sieng ka ta; in ruhai chu in mâichâmhai vêla chun the dar ka tih."
6,"In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be abolished.","In chêngna hmunhaia po po chun khawpuihai chu suksiet nîng an ta, bâwlhmunhai chu râusan nîng an ta; in mâichâmhai chu râusan le suksiet a ni theina ding le in milimhai chu suktliek le suktâwp a nia, in nisa- milimhai chu phûr thlûk a na, in sinthawhai chu suktâwp a ni theina dingin."
7,"And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, thata umhai chu nangni lai ngei tlûng an ta, chun, LALPA ka ni mi hre tâng in tih."
8,"Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.","Amiruokchu, ṭhenkhat la hlâng ka ta, ramhaia sukdara in um pha chun, hnamhai laia chun ṭhen- khat chun kâwlhnâm chu pumpel in tih."
9,"And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.","Chun, nangni laia chuonga suok- hai chun, hnamhai sala ṭhuoia an umnahai laia an um lai chun mi hre zing an ta, an lungril keimaa in- thawka ṭhea um tah, châkna chu ka lo sukkawi ta zie hai le, an mithai an milimhai châktaka an enna le chun; chun, anni an tirdakumna po poa an lo thaw tah, thil ṭha naw ta ding chun an mithmu ngeia chun intirdak an tih."
10,And they shall know that I am Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.,"Chun, LALPA ka ni ti hrieng an ta; an kuomah hieng thil ṭha naw hi ka thaw ding a nih ka ti hi a mei meia hril ka ni nawh ti hre bawk an tih,’” tiin."
11,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, “I kut ben la, i kein sir la, chun, Ehei! Israel sûngkaw tirdakumna suol po po lei chun, kâwlhnâma le, ṭâmnaa le hripuiah an tlu ding a ni sih a, ti rawh."
12,He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath upon them.,"Hlataka umhai chu hripuiin thîng an ta; a hnaia umhai chu kâwl- hnâmah tlûng an ta, chun, umhmuna uma inhuol khuma um chu ṭâmin thîng a tih: chuong ang chun ka lungsenna chu an chunga chun ka sukpuitling ding a nih."
13,"And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.","Chun, an mi thathai chu an mâichâm vêla an milimhai laia a um a, muol insâng tina dâm, tlâng sâng sîp tinahai dâm, thing hring tin hnuoiahai dâm, thingsaisuo lien hnuoi tinahai dâm, an milimhai kuoma riminhnik an inhlânnahai po poa chun an um pha chun LALPA ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih."
14,"And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, an chunga chun ka kut chu inlet ka ta, thlalêra inthawka Dibla tieng, an hluona sûng po po chu, ram chu râusana siemin suk- sieng ka tih; chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
