1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
2,"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah:","“Mihriem naupa, Israel rama zâwlnei, anni lungrila inthawk ela thuhrillâwkhai hril hlaktuhai kuoma chun thu hril la, ‘LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u,’ ti rawh."
3,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: zâwlnei invêt, iengkhawm hmu si loa mâni ngaidân ngawt zâwmtu chu a chung a rik!"
4,"O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.","Aw Israel, i zâwlneihai chu hmun ṭâwpa sihalhai ang an ni tah a."
5,"Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.","A âwnga chun in hang fe nawh a, LALPA nia indonaa ngîrna dingin Israel sûngkaw ta ding chun paldâi in siem bawk nawh a."
6,"They have seen falsehood and lying divination, that say, Jehovah saith; but Jehovah hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.","Anni chun teplo mei mei le vân tieng thil khêl thu an hmu a, LALPA- IN anni chu a tir naw sain, ‘LALPAIN a tih’ tiin an thu chu sukdet ni ngei dingin mihai an inbeiseitir a."
7,"Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah saith; albeit I have not spoken?","Keiin ka hril nawh a, ‘LALPA chun a hril a nih,’ in ti hin thilhmulâwk teplo chu in hmuin vântieng thil inkhêl chu in hril a ni nâwm a nih?” tiin."
8,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: “Teplo mei mei in hril a, khêlhai chu in hmu leiin, ngai ta u, nangni chu ka dodâl cheu a nih. Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
9,"And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.","Vântieng thukhêl le, zâwlnei teplo mei mei hmutuhai chunga chun ka kut chu um a ta; ka mihai in- khâwmnaa chun ṭhang ve naw ni hai a, Israel sûngkaw chanchin inziek- naa chun ziek ni bawk naw nih a; Israel rama chun lût bawk naw ni hai a; chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng in tih."
10,"Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered mortar:","‘Inremna,’ tiin ka mihai chu an ṭhuoi suol a; inremna chu a um nawh a, chun, miin bang a siem lai chun, ngai ta, chirhak inhnâk loin an bel a;"
11,"say unto them that daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.","chuong chirhak inhnâk loa beltuhai kuoma chun, a tla nâwk el ding a nih ti hril rawh, ruo a hrâta hrât hung sûr a ta, riel nasatak tlâng a ta, thlipui nasatakin nuoi a tih."
12,"Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?","Ngai ta u, bang chu a tla pha chun in kuomah, ‘In ibelna chu khâwlai am a um leh?’ an ti naw ding cheu maw?"
13,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; Ka lunginsenin thlipui hrângin suksieng ka tih; ka lunginsennaa chun ruo a hrâta hrâta sûr um a ta, a sukbohmang ding lunginsena riel nasatak leh."
14,"So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chuongchun, bang chirhak in- hnâk loa in bel kha suksieng ka ta, hnuoiah hung la thlâng ka tih; chuongchun, a lung phûm chu inlang tâng a ta, tlûng a ta, chu sûnga chun sukbohmangin um in tih; chun, LALPA ka ni mi hre tâng in tih."
15,"Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;","Chuong ang chun ka lungin- senna chu bang chunga le chirhak inhnâk loa beltuhai chunga chun sukpuitling ka ta; in kuoma chun, ‘Bang chu a um ta nawh a, a beltuhai khawm,’ tîng an tih."
16,"to wit, the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Zâwlneihai Jerusalem chung- thu hrillâwktu le inremna um silo inremna dinga thilhmulâwk hmuhai chunga chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
17,"And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, an lungrila inthawka thu hriltuhai, i mihai naunuhai tieng chu ngha rawh; anni kalin thu hril la,"
18,"and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?","Lalpa PATHIEN chun, ‘Nu- hmei, kutrîng tina inbuntir ding ṭhuitu le, thlahai pêl dinga mi saput ieng ang po el lua dinga rawmawl siem chu a chung a rik de! a tih,’ ti rawh. Ka mihai thlahai chu pêlin nangni ta ding chauin thla chu in sandam ding maw?"
19,"And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.","Buṭei vei khat le bei hlek hmu dingin ka mihai lai chun, mi thi lo dinghai chu that ding le, mi hring lo dinghai chu sandam dingin, thu khêl ngai hlak ka mihai chu hlêmin, ka mihai lai chun i mi lo sukhmingsiet tah a."
20,"Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, Ngai ta u, vate anga manna dinga in thil inbuntirhai chu ka dodâl a nih; in kuthaia inthawkin ka keithlêr ding a nih; in man tumhai chu infetir ka ta, vate anga in ipêlhai ngei chu."
21,"Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","In rawmawlhai chu keithlêr ka ta, ka mihai chu in kuta inthawkin sansuok ka tih; chun, pêl dingin in kuta chun um ta naw ni hai; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih."
22,"Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive;","Mi fel lungril ka suklungngai naw chu thukhêla in suklungzîng tâk leiin mi rilo kuthai khawm in lo suk- hrât tah a, a lampui riloa inthawka a kîr nâwk nawna dingin hringna thu in tiem a;"
23,"Therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","chuleichun, teplo chu hmu nâwk ta naw ti niu a, vântieng thil- hmulâwkhai khawm chu; chun, ka mihai chu in kuta inthawkin sansuok ka ta, LALPA chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng in tih,” tiin."
