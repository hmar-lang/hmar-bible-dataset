3,"And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.","Chun, Israel Pathien ropuina chu, a umna hmuna inthawk chun in kawtkhâr bula chun a hang feh a; chun, mi puon zai inhmia inchei a, a kâwnga lekhaziektu lekhatuibûr neitu chu a ko tah a."
4,"And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.","Chun, LALPA chun a kuoma chun, “Khawpui laia chun, Jerusalem laia chun fe suok la, chu sûnga tirdak- umnahai thawa um tahai po po leia khêk a, thuokdawnghai mi chuonghai bâwkhaia chun inchikna sie rawh,” a tih a."

8,"And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?","Chun, an that zing lai chun keia khâta mâksanin ka um a, ka hmaia hnuoi sikin ka bawkkhup a, ka khêk a, “A, Lalpa PATHIEN!

9,"Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting of judgment: for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Juda le Israel sûngkaw suolna chu a nasa êm êm a, ram chu thisenin a sip a, khawpui sûng chu rorêlna pawisak nawnain a sip a, ‘LALPA chun ram hi a nghatsan tah a, LALPA chun a hmu nawh,’ an ti sih a."
