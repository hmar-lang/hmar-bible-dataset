1,"Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.","Chu nawa chun thlarau chun a mi hang dawm kâng a. LALPA in dâi saktieng kawtkhâr, saktieng sawnga chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a; chun, ngai ta, chu dâi kawtkhâra chun mi sâwmhni panga an um a; chun, anni laia chun Azzur naupa Jaazania le Benaia naupa Pelatia, mipuihai hotuhai chu ka hmuh a."
2,"And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city;","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mi- hriem naupa, hi khawpuia thurâwn rilo pea, suolna suksuoktuhai chu hieng mihai hi an nih."
3,"that say, The time is not near to build houses: this city is the caldron, and we are the flesh.","Anni chun, ‘Inhai bâwlna ding hun a hnai ta a ni nâwm a nih? Hi khawpui hi sumbepui chu a na, eini hi a sahai chu ei nih,’ an tih a."
4,"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.","Chuleiin, an chunga chun thu hrillâwk la, aw mihriem naupa, hrillâwk rawh,” a ta."
5,"And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.","Chun, LALPA thlarau chu ka chungah a hung tlung a, ka kuoma chun, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih ti hril rawh: Aw Israel sûngkuohai, chuong ang chun in hril am a ni; in lungrilhaia thil hung lûthai chu ka hriet sih a."
6,"Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.","Hi khawpuia hin in mi thathai chu in sukpung a, chutaka kawtthlêr- hai chu mi thathaiin in suksip a."
7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.","“Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih: In ithathai a sûnga in inzâltirhai hi, sa chu an nih; khawpui chu sumbepui chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, a sûnga inthawk chun lâk suokin um a tih."
8,"Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Kâwlhnâm chu in ṭih a; in chung- ah kâwlhnâm chu hung intlungtir ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
9,"And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun la suok ka ti cheu a, hmêlhrietlohai kutah pêng ka ti cheu a, chun, nang- ni lai chun rorêlna chu tirsuok ka tih."
10,Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.,"Kâwlhnâmah tlûng in ta, Israel ramria chun ro rêlpêk ka ti cheu a; chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti hre tâng in tih."
11,"This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel;","Hi khawpui hi in sumbepui chu ni naw nih a, nangni khawm a sûnga sa chu ni nâwng in tih; Israel ramria chun ro ka rêlpêk ding cheu a nih;"
12,"and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.","chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti hre tâng in tih; ka thuruothaia chun in fe nawh a, ka rorêlhai khawm in zâwm si nawh a; amiruokchu, in vêla hnam- hai dân ang chun in thaw ta lem a,” tiin."
13,"And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?","Chun, thu ka hril lai chun Benaia naupa Pelatia chu a thi tah a. Chun, ka hmaia hnuoi sikin ka bawk- khup a, râwl inringtakin ka khêk a, “A khai, Lalpa PATHIEN! Israel la um sunhai hi i suktâwp el ding am a nih?” tiin."
14,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
15,"Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession.","“Mihriem naupa, i unauhai, i unauhai ngei, i chipuihai, Israel sûngkuo po po chu, an rêngin, an kuoma chun Jerusalem hluotuhai chun, ‘LALPAA inthawk chun fe hmang unla, keini kuomah hi ram hi nei dinga pêk a ni tah,’ an tih a;"
16,"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.","chuleiin, hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; ‘Hnamhai laia inthawka hlataka chun ka lo sawn ta deh a, ramhai laia chun anni chu ka lo sukdar ta deha chu, an va fena ramhaia chun hun sâwt nawtê sûnga ding chun an ta dingin hmun inthieng la ni ta fan ka tih’ tiin."
17,"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.","Chuleiin, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, hnamhai laia inthawk chun la khâwm ka ti cheu a, sukdara in umna ramhaia inthawk chun kei khâwm ka ti cheu a, Israel ram chu pêng ka ti cheu,’ ti rawh."
18,"And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.","Chun, chutaka chun hung an ta, chutaka inthawk chun thil tirdakum- hai po po le thil pawrchehai po po chu la hmang an ta."
19,"And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;","Anni chu lungril hmunkhat pêng ka ta; nangmaa chun lungril thar sie bawk ka tih; chun, an tisaa lungril lung anga ngar chu lâng ka ta, an kuoma chun tisa lungril innêm pêng ka tih."
20,"that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.","Ka thuruothaia an fe theina ding le, ka dânhai chu an kawl a, an thaw theina dingin; chun, ka mihai hung nîng an ta, kei khawm an Pathien nîng ka tih."
21,"But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Nisienlakhawm, an lungrilhaia an tirdakumna le an pawrchenahai zâwmtuhai chu, an lu chunghaia ngei chun an suol maw chu innghat ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
22,"Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.","Chun, cherubhai chun an thla- hai chu an zâr a, kekuolhai chu an sirahai chun a um a; chungtienga chun Israel ropuina chu an chungah a um a."
23,"And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.","Chun, LALPA ropuina chu khawpui laia inthawk chun a hung suok a, khawpui saktieng sîra um tlâng chunga chun a hang ngîr tah a."
24,"And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.","Chun, thlarau chun a mi dawm- kâng a, Pathien thlaraua thilhmu- lâwknaa chun Kaldaia sal intânghai kuoma chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a. Chuongchun, ka thilhmulâwk hmu chun chungtieng a mi fesan tah a."
25,Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had showed me.,"Chun, sal intânghai kuoma chun LALPAIN ka kuoma a lo inentir tah thilhai po po chu ka hril tah a."
