1,"Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Kum kuona kum, thla sâwm- na, chu thla ni sâwm ni chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a;"
2,"Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this selfsame day: the king of Babylon drew close unto Jerusalem this selfsame day.","“Mihriem naupa, hi ni hin Babulon lal chun Jerusalem a hung hnai a nih."
3,"And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:","Chun, sûngkaw hel hmanghai kuoma chun tekhithu hril la, an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih: Sumbepui inchuon unla, inchuon unla, A sûnga chun tui buok unla;"
4,"gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.","Chun, chutaka chun a sa tlinhai thlâk unla, A tlang ṭha deu deuhai, a mal le a dârhai le A ru tuihnâihai chun suksip ro."
5,"Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile of wood for the bones under the caldron; make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it.","Ran ruol laia ditumtak chu la unla, A ruhai chu a hnuoi tieng sie unla, Insoṭhattir hle unla, a ruhai chu but ro;"
6,"Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen upon it.","“Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Khawpui, thisen insuo hmang chu a chung a rik, sum- bepui a tuiêkna a sûnga um le, a tuiêkna khawm bo thei lo chu, a chung a rik! a tlang tlangin la suok rawh, thlang bik nei loin."
7,"For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.","A thisen chu ama sûnga chun a um sih a, lungpui ruok chunga chun ân suoh a; pilvuta zuk vurkhum theina ding, leihnuoi chunga chun a bunthlâk si nawh a."
8,"That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.","Phuba la dinga hung tlung dinga lunginsenna chu ân umtir theina dingin, a thisen chu lungpui ruok chunga chun kân suoh a, inkhum a ni nawna dingin."
9,Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.,"Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Khawpui thisen insuo hmang chu a chung a rik! Kei khawma a thing sep khawm chu suklien ka ta."
10,"Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.","Thing buk ṭeu la, mei ti chawk ṭha la, sa chu intlawk ṭhattir hle la, a tuihâng chu hâng deuin, a ruhai chu râw hmang ni raw se."
11,"Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.","Chun, meiling chunga chun a ruokin inchuon la, a hung luma, a dârsen chu a hung inling theina dingin, chuongchun, ân thieng nawna chu a sûnga chun a hung intui theina dingin le, a tuiêkhai chu a hung kâng- hmang theina dingin."
12,She hath wearied herself with toil; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her; her rust goeth not forth by fire.,Sâwl neng khawpa thaw hnung khawmin a tuiêkna chu amaa in- thawk chun a tlan hmang si nawh a; a tuiêkna chu mei khawma a sukbo thei nawh.
13,"In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.","I pawrchenaa chun hurna a um a; ka sukfai cheh a, sukfaia i um naw leiin, i pawrchenaa inthawkin sukfai ni ngai ta hrim hrim naw ti ni, ka lunginsenna hi i chunga ka suk- lungâwi hmakhat chun."
14,"I, Jehovah, have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Kei LALPA chun ka hril tah a, hung tlung ngei a ta, thaw khawm thâwng ka tih, kîr nâwk naw ning a, hla naw nîng a, insîr bawk naw ning; i um dânhai ang pei le i thilthawhai ang peiin ro rêlpêk an ti che, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
15,"Also the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung nâwk a:
16,"Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.","“Mihriem naupa, ngai ta, thâwkkhatin i mithai châkna chu nangmaa inthawkin ka lâk hmang ding a nih; ṭap naw ti nih a, sûn bawk naw ti ni, i mitthlihai khawm luong thla bawk naw ni."
17,"Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.","Inthuok huoi la, amiruokchu, inring loin, mithi ta ding chun sûnna siem naw la, i lukâwm chu kâwm la, i kehaia chun i kekawkhai chu bun la, i hmûrhai chu hup naw la, lusûntuhai bei chu fa naw rawh,” tiin."
18,So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.,"Chuongchun, zîngkâr chun mi- puihai kuoma chun thu chu ka hril a, a zântieng chun ka nuhmei chu a thi tah a; chun, thu pêka ka um ang chun zîngkâr chun ka thaw tah a."
19,"And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?","Chun, mipuihai chun ka kuoma chun, “Hieng thil i thawhai hi, keini ta dingin ieng am an niha i mi hril naw ding maw?” an ta."
20,"Then I said unto them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Kei chun an kuomah, “LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:"
21,"Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.","‘Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Ngai ta, ka hmun inthieng in thilthawtheina chapopui le, in mithai châkna, in lungrilin a hmangai chu ka sukhmingsiet ding a nih; chun, in naupasalhai le in nau nuhmeihai in hnunga in mâksanhai kha kâwlhnâmah tlung an ta."
22,"And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.","Chun, ka thaw ta ang khan thâwng in ta; in hmûrhai chu inkhum naw ti niu a, mihriemhai bei chu fa bawk naw ti niu."
23,"And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.","In lu haia chun in lukâwmhai chu kâwm in ta, in kekawkhai chu in kehai chun bun in ta; ṭap naw ti niu a, sûn bawk naw ti niu; amiruokchu, in suolnaa chun riral lem in ta, insûntuo lem in tih."
24,"Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Ezekiel hi in ta dingin inchikna nîng a ta; amain a thaw ang tak hin thaw vêng in tih; hienghai hi a hung tlung pha chun LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih.’"
25,"And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, an kul det, an ropuina hlimna, an mithai châkna le, an lungril an sienahai, an naupasalhai le an naunuhmeihai ka lâk pha chun,"
26,"that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?",chu nia chun a pumpeltu chu i kuomah hungin a hung inhriettir naw ding che am a nih?
27,"In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chu nia chun chu a pumpeltu kuoma chun i bau chu ka tâng i ta, thu hril i ta, ṭawng theiloin um ta naw ti ni; chuongchun, an ta ding chun inchikna nîng i ta; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
