1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:
2,"Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;","“Mihriem naupa, i chipui thlahai kuoma chun thu hril la, an kuomah hieng hin ti rawh: ‘Ram chunga chun kâwlhnâm ka hung intlungtir pha, rama mihai chun anni laia mi an lâk a, an ta dinga vêngtu anga an sie chun;"
3,"if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;","ram chunga chun kâwlhnâm chu a hung tlung phaa a lo hmu chun tawtawrâwt mût sienla, mipuihai chu vaulâwk raw se;"
4,"then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.","tukhawma tawtawrâwt ri chu hrea, vaulâwkna pawisa lo chu, kâwl- hnâm chu a hung tlung a, ama chu lâk hmang a ni chun, a thisen chu ama lu chunga ngei chun um a tih."
5,"He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.","Tawtawrâwt ri chu a hriet a, nisienlakhawm, vaulâwkna chu a pawisa nawh a; a thisen chu ama chunga chun um a tih, vaulâwkna chu lo pawisa ni sien chu a nun chu a sanhim ding a nih."
6,"But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.","Nisienlakhawm, vêngtu chun kâwlhnâm hung tlung chu a hmuh a, tawtawrâwt a mût nawh a, mipuihai chu vaulâwk an ni nawh a, kâwlhnâm chu a hung tlung a, anni laia mi tukhawm chu a lâk hmang chun; a suolnaa chu lâk hmang a na; amiruokchu, a thisen maw chu vêngtu kuta chun phût ka tih,’ tiin."
7,"So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.","Chuongchun, nang mihriem naupa, Israel sûngkuo ta ding chun vêngtuah ka sie ta che a nih; chuleiin, ka baua thu chu hre la, anni chu keimaa inthawka vaulâwkna chu pe rawh."
8,"When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.","Mi rilo kuoma chun, ‘Aw mi rilo, i thi ngei ding a nih,’ ka tih a, mi rilo chu a um dân bânsan dinga vau- lâwkna thu i hril si naw chun mi rilo chu ama suolnaa chun thîng a ta, amiruokchu, a thisen maw chu nangmaa chun ka phût ding a nih."
9,"Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.","Nisienlakhawm, mi rilo chu a um dân bânsan dinga i vaulâwk a, a um dân a bânsan si naw chun, ama chu ama suolnaa chun thîng a ta, nang chun i nun i sanhim nîng a tih."
10,"And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live?","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun hieng hin hril rawh, ‘Hieng ang hin in tih a; Ei bâwsietnahai le ei suolnahai chu ei chungah a um a, annia chun ei riral hmang a ni hi, iengtin am hring ei ta?’ tiin."
11,"Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?","An kuoma chun, ‘Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; mi rilo thinaa chun lâwmna ka nei nawh a; mi rilo chu a um dân a bânsan a, a hring ruok chun lâwmna ka nei a; hung kîr ro, in lampui suola inthawk chun hung kîr ro; aw Israel sûngkuo, iengdingin am thîng in ta?’ ti rawh."
12,"And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.","Chun, nang mihriem naupa, i chipuihai thlahai kuoma chun hieng hin hril rawh; mi fel felna chun ama chu a bâwsietna nia chun sanhim naw nih a; mi rilo rîtlona thua chun, a rîtlonaa inthawka a hung kîr nia chun a rîtlonaa chun tlu naw nih; chun, mi fel chu a suksuolna nia chun a felnain hring bawk naw nih."
13,"When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die.","Mi fel kuoma chun a hring ngei ding a ni ka ti pha chun, a felna chu a ring a, suolna a thaw chun, a thil thaw felhai chu a ieng khawm hriet zing ni naw nih a; amiruokchu, a suolna a lo thaw taha chun thîng a tih."
14,"Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;","Chun, mi rilo kuomah, ‘I thi ngei ding a nih,’ ka ti ve a; ama chu a suolnaa inthawk chun a hung kîr a, ân dik le dân thil chu a thaw chun;"
15,"if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.","mi rilo chun bathai chu a thung a, inrûka a lâk tahai chu a pêk nâwk a, nun dân thuruot chu a hrawh a, thil a suksuol naw chun, hring ngei ngei a ta, thi naw nih."
16,None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.,Ama chunga chun thil a lo suksuol tahai hrim hrim a ieng khawm chu hriet zing ni ta naw nih a; ân dik le dân thil chu a lo thaw tâk lei chun a hring ngei ding a nih.
17,"Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.","Amiruokchu, i chipui thlahai chun, ‘Lalpa lampui chu ân ang vawng nawh a,’ an ti chun, anni chungthua ruok chun, anni lampui chu ân ang vawng naw lem a."
18,"When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein.","Mi fel chu a felnaa inthawka ân herhmanga thil suol a thaw chun, chutaka chun a thi ngei ding a nih."
19,"And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.","Chun, mi rilo chu a rîtlonaa inthawka ân her hmanga, ân dik le dân thil chu a thaw chun, chutaka bawk chun hring a tih."
20,"Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.","Amiruokchu, ‘Lalpa lampui chu ân ang vawng nawh,’ in la ti rawp chun, Aw Israel sûngkuo, mi tin chu ama lampuihai ang sengin, a chung- ah rorêl ka tih,” tiin."
21,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.","Kan sal intâng a kum sâwmpa- hni kum, thla sâwmna, chu thla ni nga ni chun Jerusalema inthawka hung tlân suok mi pakhat chu ka kuomah a hung a, ka kuomah “Khaw- pui chu suksiet a ni tah,” a hung tih a."
22,"Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.","Chun, chu hung tlân suok hung hma, zântieng chun LALPA kut chu ka chungah a um a, zîngkâra ka kuoma a hung hma po chun ka bau chu a mîn kâktir a; ka bau chu inkâk- tirin a um a, ṭawng thei loin ka um ta nawh a."
23,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
24,"Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.","“Mihriem naupa, Israel rama hmun se tahai hluotuhai chun thu an hril a, ‘Abraham chu pakhat chau a na, ram chu a lo hluo tah a; eini hlak chu tamtak ei na, ram chu hluo dinga pêk ei ni tho a,’ tiin."
25,"Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes unto your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?","Chuleiin, an kuoma chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Thisen leh bu in fâk a, in milimhai tieng chun in mithai in inlên a, thisen in insuo a, ram chu in chang hrim ding am a nih?"
26,"Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor’s wife: and shall ye possess the land?","In kâwlhnâm chu in ring a, thil pawrche chu in thawh a, mi tinin mâni tuolbâwm nuhmeihai chu in sukpawrcheh a; ram chu in chang hrim ding am a nih?"
27,"Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.","Hieng hin an kuoma chun hril rawh; Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ka hring zing angin, chuong hmun se taha umhai chu kâwl- hnâmah tlûng an ta, rama umhai chu ramsahai kuomah fâk zo dingin ka pêk ding a nih; chun, kul det le pûka umhai chu hripuiin thîng an tih."
28,"And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.","Ram chu râusanah siem ka ta, maktia um ding leh; a thilthawtheina chapona chu re tâng a ta, Israel tlânghai chu râusan ni tâng a ta, tukhawm fethleng ta naw ni hai."
29,"Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.","An thil pawrche lo thaw tahai po po leia ram chu râusan le maktia um dinga ka siem pha chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
30,"And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah.","“Nangma chungthua chu, mi- hriem naupa, i chipuihai thlahai chu bang hrûla le in kawtkhârhaia chun nanga chanchin an hril a, anni le anni an inbiek a, mi tinin a unau kuoma chun, ‘La hung ta, ka ngên che hi, LALPAA inthawka hung suok thu chu ieng am a nih hung ngai ta,’ an tih a."
31,"And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but do them not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their gain.","Mipuihai chu an hung angin i kuoma chun anni chu an hung a, ka mihai angin i hmaa chun an ṭhung a, i thuhai chu an ngai a, amiruokchu, thaw si loin; an bau chun nasatakin hmangaina an inlangtir a, amiruok- chu, an lungrilhai chun an hlâwkna chu a hnawt sih a."
32,"And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.","Ngai ta, an ta ding chun nang chu mi pakhat râwl ṭhatak neia, thil sutmihai sut thiem mi hla ditumtak ang chu i nih; i thuhai chu an hriet a, an thaw si nawh a."
33,"And when this cometh to pass (behold, it cometh), then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.","Chun, hi hi a hung tlung pha chun, (ngai ta, a hung tlung mêk) anni lai chun zâwlnei a lo um zing a nih, ti hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
