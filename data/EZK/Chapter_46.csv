1,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: huon sûng tuollai sûngril lem dâi kawtkhâr saktieng sawng saw ni ruk sinthaw sûng po inkhâr a ta; amiruokchu, châwlni chun inhawng a ta, thla thar nia khawm chun inhawng bawk a tih."
2,"And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.","Dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk lampuia chun lal chu lût a ta; dâi kawtkhâr bieng sîra chun ngîr a ta, chun, thiempu chun a pumrawhmang thil- inhlân ding le, a inremna thilinhlân dinghai chu buotsai a ta; dâi kawt- khâr tuolpûka chun chibai bûk a ta; chun, fe suok nâwk a ta, amiruokchu, zântieng chen chun dâi kawtkhâr chu khâr ni naw nih."
3,And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.,"Chun, châwlnihaia le thla thar- haia chun chu ram mipuihai chun LALPA hmaah dâi kawtkhâr lûtnaa chun chibai bûk an tih."
4,And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto Jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;,"Chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân lalin LALPA kuoma ân hlân ding chu châwlnia ding chu berâmte paruk demkailo, berâmchal demkailo pa- khat leh nîng a ta,"
5,"and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.","chun, bu thilinhlâna ding chun berâmchal pakhatah epha khat; chun, berâmtehai pakhatah bu thilin- hlân ding chu a pêk thei ang ang nîng a ta, chun, epha peia hriek hin khat leh."
6,"And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:","Chun, thla thar nia ding bâwng- chal tuoi demkailo pakhat nîng a ta; berâmte paruk le berâmchal leh; an rêngin demkailo an ni ding a nih;"
7,"and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.","bu thilinhlân ding chu buotsai a ta, bâwngchal ding chun epha khat, berâmchal ding chun epha khat bawk; chun, berâmtehai ta ding chun ân hlân thei ang tâwk tâwk nîng a ta; chun, ephaa chun hriek hin khat a ṭhang pei ding a nih."
8,"And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.","Chun, lal chu a va lût pha chun dâi kawtkhâr tuolpûk lampuia khan a fe ding a na; chutaka bawk chun a suok nâwk ding a nih."
9,"But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him.","“Nisienlakhawm, chu rama mi- hai ruoiṭhe hunbi neia LALPA hmaa an hung chun chibai bûk dinga hmârtieng dâi kawtkhâr lampuia lût chu simtieng dâi kawtkhâr lampuia khan a suok ding a nih; chun, simtieng dâi kawtkhâr lampuia lût chu hmârtieng dâi kawtkhâr lampuia khan a suok ding a nih; a hung lûtna dâi kawtkhâr lampuia ma khan a kîr nâwk ding a ni nawh a, amiruokchu, a hmaa khan a fe thleng nghâl lem ding a nih."
10,"And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth together.","An lût pha chun, lal chu anni le chun a lût ding a na, chun, an suok pha khawma, anni ruolin a suok ding a nih."
11,"And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.","Ruoiṭhenahaia le, ruoiṭhe hunbi neihaia chun bu thilinhlân chu bâwngchal pakhatah epha khat nîng a ta, berâmchal dingin epha khat bawk, chun, berâmtehai ta ding chun a pêk thei zât zât le, epha khata chun hriek hin khat pei leh."
12,"And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.","Chun, lal chun mâni nuomthua thilinhlân, pumrawhmang thilinhlân amanih, inremna thilinhlân amanih, mâni nuomthua LALPA kuoma thil- inhlân anga a buotsai pha chun, sak- tieng pang ngha dâi kawtkhâr chu mi pakhatin hawngpêk a ta; a pumraw- hmang thilinhlân le, a inremna thil- inhlânhai chu châwlnihaia thaw ang bawk khan buotsai a tih; chun, suok a ta, a suok hnung chun mi pakhatin dâi kawtkhâr chu khâr a tih."
13,And thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah daily: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it.,Ni tin LALPA ta dingin pum- rawhmang thilinhlâna dingin berâm- te kum khat mi demkailo buotsai i ta; zîngkâr tina dingin i buotsai ding a nih.
14,"And thou shalt prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance.","Chun, zîng tin tin chun chu le chun bu thilinhlân khawm buotsai i ta, epha hmun ruka ṭhea hmun khat le, hriek hin hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat, chu beiphit inditak chu suk- tlawr dingin; chun, dân um zing angin, LALPA kuoma bu thilinhlân chu a ni zing zing ding a nih."
15,"Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.","Chuong ang chun berâmte chu buotsai an ta, bu thilinhlân le, hriek leh, zîng tin tina pumrawhmang thilinhlân zing zing ni ding chun."
16,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Lalin a naupasal a tu kuom- a khawm thilpêk pe ta ang sienla, ama rochan a na, a naupasalhai ta chu a ni hrim ding a nih; rohluo tieng kawnga an thil chan chu a nih."
17,"But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.","Amiruokchu, a suok pakhat kuoma chun a rochan chu thilpêk anga a pêk chun; ama chu insuo a ni kum chen chun a ta nîng a ta; chu zoa chun lal kuoma ma chun inkîr nâwk nîng a tih; ama rochan hrim kha chu a naupasalhai ta ding nîng a tih."
18,"Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.","Chu nawa khawm chun, lal chun an thil neihaia anni nêksâwr dingin mihai rochan chu a lâkpêk ding a ni nawh a; an in le loa inthawk a hnawt suok ding a ni nawh, ama thil neia inthawk ngeiin a naupa- salhai chu rochan a pêk lem ding a na, chuongchun, ka mihai chu mâni thil neia inthawka mi tin chu an indar nawna dingin,” tiin."
19,"Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.","Chun, dâi kawtkhâr sîra um lûtna chu a mi fethlengpui a, thiem- puhai pindan inthieng sim sawng- haia chun a mi ṭhuoi tah a; chun, ngai ta, a saktieng pang hnungtienga chun hmun hi a um a."
20,"And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, and where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Hi hi a nih thiempu haiin bawsietna thilin- hlân chu an suongna ding le, suol thilinhlân an suongna ding hmun chu; bu thilinhlân khawm hitaka hin em bawk an tih; chuongchun, mipui chu hlânthieng dingin huon sûng tuollai puo lema chun an hung chawisuok ding a ni nawh,” a ta."
21,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.","Chun, huon sûng tuollai puo lema chun a mi ṭhuoi a, chuongchun, huon kil lia chun a mîn fethlengtir a; chun, ngai ta, chu huon ki tina chun tuollai hi a um a."
22,"In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure.","Huon sûng tuollai kihai pali chun tuollai inhuonkhum, tawng sâwmlia sei, tawng sâwmthuma lien hi a um a; hieng a kihai pali hi intiet seng an nih."
23,"And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.","An sûnga hmun li sûnga a vêl el chun lung an rem tlar a, chun, a vêl el chun chu tlarhai hnuoia chun suong- na thukhai siem a na."
24,"Then said he unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Hieng hi thil suongna in, hi in rawngbâwltuhaiin mihai inthâwi- nahai an suongna ding chu a nih,” a tih a."
