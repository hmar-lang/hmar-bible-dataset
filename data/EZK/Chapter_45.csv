3,"And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy.","Chun, hi hi tiet hi inkhîng i ta, a dung tawng sîng hni sâng nga, a khang sîng khat; chu sûnga chun hmun inthieng, ân thieng tak chu a um ding a nih."
4,"It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.","Ram hmun inthieng chu a na, thiempuhai hmun inthienga rawng- bâwltuhai, LALPA hmaa rawngbâwl dinga hung hnaihai ta ding chu nîng a tih; an inhai hmun ding le, hmun inthieng ta dinga hmun inthieng chu nîng a tih."
5,"And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, for twenty chambers.","Chun, a dung tawng sîng hni sâng nga le a khang tawng sîng khat chu Levi mihai, chu ina rawngbâwl- tuhai, chêngna khawpui dingin, an chan ding chu nîng a ta."
6,"And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.","Chun, khawpui iṭhut ding hmun tawng sâng ngaa lien, tawng sîng hni sâng ngaa sei, chan inthieng in- hlânna epa khan ruot i ta, chu chu Israel sûngkuo pumpui ta ding nîng a ta."
7,"And whatsoever is for the prince shall be on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.","Chun, lal ta dinga hmun chu sîr khata chun nîng a ta, a sîr khing tienga chun hmun inthieng thil in- hlânna, khawpui sûng ṭhut le, hmun inthieng inhlânna hmatieng chu nîng a ta, saktienga chun khi saktiengah, thlangtienga inthawk chun khu thlangtiengah, chun, a dung tieng chu, thlangtieng ramria inthawka saktieng ramri chenin hmun pakhat ep chu nîng a tih."
8,In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.,"Chu ram chu Israelhai laia ama ta dinga a chan chu nîng a ta; ka lalhai chun ka mihai chu nêksâwr ta ngai naw ni hai a; amiruokchu, Israel sûngkuo laia chun an hnam ang peiin ram chu pe lem tâng an tih."
9,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Aw Israel lalhai, inhuntâwktir ta ro; pâwngnêkna le suksietna chu sie hmang unla, indikna le rorêl fel chîng ta unla; ka mihai hnawt suok hi ma ta ro; Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
10,"Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.","Bûkna indiktakhai chu nei in ta, epha indik le, bath indik le chun."
11,"The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.","Epha le bath chu inkhina ang- khat nîng an ta, bath chun homer hmun sâwma ṭhea hmun khat keng a ta, epha khawm chun homer hmun sâwma ṭhea hmun khat bawk, chu inkhina chu homer dungzui pei a ni ding a nih."
12,"And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.","Shekel chu gera sâwmhni nîng a ta; chun, in mina chu shekel sâwm- ruk nîng a tih."
13,This is the oblation that ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley;,“Hi hi thilinhlân in inhlân ding- hai chu nîng a tih; bupui homer khata chun epha hmun ruka ṭhea hmun khat; buṭei homer khata chun epha hmun ruka ṭhea a hmun khat pêng in ta;
14,"and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, even a homer (for ten baths are a homer);","chun, hriek chan ruot thua chun, kor tinah bath hmun sâwma ṭhea hmun khat nîng a tih; chu chu bath sâwm tluk a na, homer khat a nih."
15,"and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel;—for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.","chun, berâm ruol za hni peiah berâm pakhat, Israel ram hlopetna hmun ṭhataka inthawkin, bu thilin- hlâna ding le, pumrawhmang thilin- hlâna ding le, inremna thilinhlâna dinga an ta dinga intlanna siempêk dingin pêk nîng a tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
16,All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel.,Rama mipuihai po po chun hi thilinhlân ang hi Israel rama lal ta ding chun an pêk ding a nih.
17,"And it shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.","Chun, ruoiṭhenahaia le, thla tharhaia le, châwlnihaia le, Israel sûngkuo ruoiṭhena hunbi neihaia chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai, bu thilinhlânhai, dâwnmi thilinhlân- hai inhlân chu lal chan chu ni ve thung a tih; Israel sûngkuo ta dinga intlanna siemna dingin, suol thilin- hlânhai, bu thilinhlânhai, pumraw- hmang thilinhlânhai, inremna thilin- hlânhai chu a buotsai ding a nih."
18,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Thla hmasatak, chu thla ni khat ni chun, bâwngchal tuoi dem- kâilo lâng i ta; hmun inthieng chu sukthieng i tih;"
19,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.","thiempu chun suol thilinhlâna thisen chu lâng a ta, chu in kawtkhâr bienghaia le, mâichâm rei kil lia le, huon sûng tuollai sûngril lem dâi kawtkhâr biengahai chun nâl a ta."
20,"And so thou shalt do on the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house.","Chuongchun, chu thla ni sari ni chun mi thil lo suksuol ta tinhai ta ding le, mi lo thawpalhai ta dingin thâwng i ta; chuongchun, in ta ding chun intlanna chu siem in tih."
21,"In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.","Thla hmasatak, chu thla ni sâwm pali ni chun, fekân ruoiṭhe chu nei in tih, ni sari sûng ruoiṭhe chu; chun, chawl ṭhanglo bei chu fâk nîng a tih."
22,And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.,"Chu ni chun lal chun ama ta ding le, chu rama mipuihai ta ding chun suol thilinhlâna dingin bâwng- chal buotsai a tih."
23,"And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.","Chun, ruoiṭhe ni sari sûnga ding chun LALPA kuoma pumraw- hmang thilinhlâna dingin bâwngchal pasari le berâmchal pasari, demkailo, ni sari sûnga ni tina pakhat pei; chun, kêlchal ni tina pakhat pei, suol thilinhlâna dingin buotsai bawk a tih."
24,"And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.","Chun, bu thilinhlân, bâwngchal pakhatah epha khat, berâmchal pa- khatah epha khat, ephaa chun hriek hin khat pei leh buotsai bawk a tih."
25,"In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meal-offering, and according to the oil.","Thla sarinaa chun, chu thla ni sâwmpangana chun, ruoiṭhenaa ni sari sûng chu angkhat vawngin thâwng a tih; suol thil inhlân ang pei le, pumrawhmang thilinhlân ang pei le, bu thilinhlân ang pei le, hriek thilinhlân ang peiin."
