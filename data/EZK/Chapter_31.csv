1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Kum sâwmpakhatna, thla thumna, chu thlaa ni khat ni chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
2,"Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?","“Mihriem naupa, Aigupta lal Pharao le a mipuihai kuoma chun hi hi hril rawh; I ropuinaa hin tu ang am i na?"
3,"Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.","Ngai ta, Assuria chu Lebanona thingkau ṭha tak nei, Buk hlim nei, dung tieng insâng tak a na; A lêrzîk khawm chu kâu inbuk tak laia chun a um a."
4,"The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field.","Tuihai chun ama chu a châwm a, li inthûk chun ân ṭhang- tir a, A phunna sîr vêla chun a vadunghai chu a luong a, A tui luongnahai chu loa thing tin kuoma chun a tir a."
5,"Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot them forth.","Chuongchun, ân sângzie chu loa thing po pohai chunga chawisângin a um a, A kauhai chu a tam a, a zârhai chu tui tam lei chun, An hung inzar suok sei tâwl a."
6,All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.,"A kâuhaiah chunglêng vatehai po poin buhai an sep a, A zârhai hnuoia chun rama ramsahai po po chun têhai an nei a, A hlim hnuoiah hnam ropuihai po po chu an chêng tah a."
7,"Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.","A kâuhai seizie le a ropuinaa chun chuong anga mâwi chu a na, A zung chu tui tamtaka chun a um sih a."
8,"The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto it in its beauty.","Pathien huona sidarhai chun ama chu tluk thei naw nih a, Fâr thinghaiin a kau khawm an tluk nawh, Insethingin a zâr khawm a tluk nawh a, A mâwinaa chun ama ang Pathien huonah thing hrim a um nawh."
9,"I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.","A zârhai tam lei chun ka siem mawi a, Chu lei chun, Pathien huona um Edena thing po pohai chun ama an îtthîk a."
10,"Therefore thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;","“Chuleichun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Insâng tienga chun chawisângin i um a; a lêrzîk chu kâubuk sataka chun ân umtir a, ân sâng lei chun a lungril chu suksângin a um a;"
11,I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.,"hnamhai laia mi thilthawthei- tak kutah ama chu pe suok ka ta; ama chu sawisa ngei a ta, a rîtlona lei chun ama chu ka hnawt suok tah a nih."
12,"And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.","Ram dang mi hnamhai ṭisimhai chun, ama chu an sât thlâk a, ama chu an mâksan tah a; tlâng chungahai le phairuom po poahai chun a kâuhai chu an tlah a, a kâuhai po po chu rama tui luongnahai chun an suktliek bawk a; hnuoia hnam tinhai chu a hlima inthawk chun an fe thla a, an mâksan tah a."
13,"Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches;","Suksieta a umnaa chun chung- lêng vatehai po po chu chêng an ta, ram hnuoia sahai po po khawm chu a kâuhai chunga chun um an tih;"
14,"to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up in their height, even all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.","a tâwpa chun tuihai kâwla thinghai po po chun an insâng leiin anni le anni inchawimawi ta ngai naw ni hai a, a kâubuk satak laia chun an lêrzîk khawm chu sie ta bawk naw ni hai a, tui dâwn ta po po chu, an thilthawtheihai chu an in- sâng ang chun ngîr ta naw bawk an tih; vânsama fe thla tahai, mihriem nauhai laia chun, leihnuoi hnuoi tienga chun anni chu thina kuoma pêk an ni ta sih a."
15,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof; and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Hremhmuna a fe thlâk ni chun, sûnna ka siem a; ama ta dingin li inthûk chu kân khum a, chutaka vadungpuihai chu ka sukchâwl a, tui nasatakhai khawm chu an châwl tah a; chun, Lebanon chu ama sûn dingin ka siem a, chun, rama thinghai po po chu ama lei chun an thidang a."
16,"I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.","Vânsama ṭum tahai laia, hrem- hmuna ka pei thlâk lai chun, a tlûkna ria chun hnamhai chu ka sukthin a; Eden thing po po Lebanona thing ṭhatak le ditumhai, tui lo dâwn tahai po po chu hnuoi khingtieng panga chun sukhlimin an um a."
17,"They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.","Kâwlhnâma thata lo um tahai kuomah, ama ruolin hremhmuna chun an fe thla ve a; anih, a bân lo ni taha, hnamhai laia a buk hlim hnuoia lo chêng tahai chu."
18,"To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.","“Edena thinghai laia hin ro- puina le mawinaah ieng le hin am in inang a? Hnuoi khingtieng panga chun Eden thinghai le chun nang chu sukhnuoi i la ni ding a nih; kâwl- hnâma thata lo um tah, sertan lohai laia chun i zâl ve ding a nih; Hi hi Pharao le a mipuihai chu an nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
