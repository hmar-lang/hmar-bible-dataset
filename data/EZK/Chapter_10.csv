1,"Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.","Chun, ka hang en a, ngai ta, cherubhai lu chunga vâna chun sapphir lung ni âwmtak, lalṭhungpha ang hi a hung inlang a."
2,"And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.","Chun, mi puon zai inhmia inchei kuoma chun thu a hril a, “Cherubhai hnuoia tawlailîr kekuol invirhai inkâra chun fe la, cherubhai inkâra meihawl chu i kut khinghniin suksip ve ve la, chun, khawpui chunga chun the dar rawh,” tiin. Chun, ka mithmu ngeia chun a va lût tah a."
3,"Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.","Chun, mi chu a va lût lai chun cherubhai chu in changtieng panga chun an ngîr a; chun, sûm chun tuol- lai sûng ril lem chu a suksip tah a."
4,"And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah’s glory.","Chun, cheruba inthawk chun LALPA ropuina chu a tungin a kai a; in kawtkhâr bula chun a ngîr tah a; chun, in chu sûmin a hung sip a, tuollai chu LALPA ropuina var chun a hung sip tah a."
5,"And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.","Chun, cherubhai thla ri chu Pathien Iengkimthawtheiin thu a hril laia a râwl angin, tuollai puo lema inthawk khawm chun ân hriet a."
6,"And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.","Chun, mi puon zai inhmia inchei kuoma chun, “Tawlailîr kekuol invir zinghai inkâra inthawk chun, che- rubhai inkâra inthawk chun, mei la la,” tia thu a pêk chun, a va lût a, tawlailîr kekuol sîra chun a va ngîr tah a."
7,"And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.","Chun, cherub pakhat chun che- rubhai inkâra inthawk chun, cherub- hai inkâra mei chu a kutin a hei ban a, a hei lâk tah a, chun, chu chu mi puon zai inhmia inchei kuthaia chun a sieh a, ama chun a lâk a, a fe suok tah a."
8,And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.,"Chun, cherubhai thla hnuoia chun mihriem kut ang hi a hung inlang tah a."
9,"And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.","Chun, ka hei en a, ngai ta, cherubhai sîra chun kekuol pali, cherub pakhat sîrah kekuol pakhat, cherub dang sîrah kekuol dang pakhat ka hmuh a. Chuong kekuolhai inlang dân chu berul lung ang el a nih."
10,"And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel.","Chun, an inlang dâna chun, an pali chun inangna an nei seng a, kekuol pakhat chu kekuol dang sûnga um ang elin."
11,"When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.","An lâwn pha chun, an sîr lia chun an lâwn a; an lâwn lai chun sîrzâwngin an inher ngai nawh a; amiruokchu, a hmasatak chun a nghatna tieng tienga chun an zui pei a; an lâwn lai chun sîrzâwngin an inher nawh."
12,"And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.","Chun, an taksa pumpui dâm, an ruongzânghai dâm, an kuthai dâm, an thlahai dâm, an kekuolhai dâm, chuong ang palia kekuol an neihai chu, mit ringawt hin a sip vawng a."
13,"As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels.","Chuong kekuolhai chu, ka hrieta chun kekuol invir zinghai tiha inbûk an nih."
14,"And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.","Chun, cherub tin chun hmai pali an nei seng a; hmai pakhatna chu cherub hmai chu a na, hmai pahnina chu mihriem hmai a na, hmai pa- thumna chu sakeibaknei hmai a na, a palina chu mupui hmai a nih."
15,And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.,"Chun, cherubhai chu dawm kângin an um a, hi hi a nih Kebar vadung panga thilhring ka hmu chu."
16,"And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.","Cherubhai chu an lâwn pha chun, kekuolhai khawm chu an sîra chun an lo lâwn veh a; cherubhai chun hnuoia inthawka inlakâng dinga an thlahai an suksâng pha chun kekuolhai khawm chu anni sîra inthawk chun an inher hmang chuong nawh a."
17,"When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.","An ngîr pha chun, hieng hi an ngîr veh a, an indawm kâng pha chun hieng hi anni ruolin an indawm kâng veh a; annia chun thilhring thlarau chu a um sih a."
18,"And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.","Chun, LALPA ropuina chu in kawtkhâr bula inthawk chun a fe suok a, cherubhai chunga chun a ngîr tah a."
19,"And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.","Chun, cherubhai chun an thla- hai chu an zâr a, an fe suok lai chun ka mithmua ngei chun hnuoia in- thawk chun an insukkâng a; kekuol- hai khawm chu an sîrhaia chun an um veh a; chun, LALPA in dâi kawtkhâr saktienga chun an ngîr a; chun, an chunga chun Israel PATHIEN ropuina chu a um a."
20,This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.,"Kebar vadung panga, Israel Pathien hnuoia thilhring ka hmu chu hi hi a nih; chun, cherubhai an nih ti ka hriet bawk a."
21,"Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.","Cherub tin chun hmai hran pali seng an nei a, thla pali seng leh; chun, an thlahai hnuoia chun mihriem kut angpui a um bawk a."
22,"And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.","Chun, an hmêl ka hmuhai ang kha an na, an inlang dân le annihai hrim hrim chu; anni chu tlûntakin hmatieng an fe seng a."
