1,"And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Mihriem naupa, i hmu kha fa la, hi lekhabu zuol hi fa la, chun, fe la, Israel sûngkuohai lai chun thu va hril rawh,” a mi ta."
2,"So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.","Chuongchun, ka bau chu ka kah a, lekhabu zuol chu a mîn fâktir tah a."
3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Mihriem naupa, i phîng kha infâktir la, hi lekhabu zuol ka pêk che hin i phîng kha sukkhawp rawh,” a ta. Chuong- chun, ka fâk tah a; ka baua chun ân hnik dân chu khuoizu ang el a nih."
4,"And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah a hril a, “Mihriem naupa, fe la, Israel sûngkuohai kuomah va fe ta, an kuoma chun ka thu hi va hril rawh."
5,"For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;","Mi ṭawng danglam le ṭawng intakhai kuoma tir i ni nawh a, Israel sûngkuohai kuoma tir i ni lem;"
6,"not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.","hnam tamtak ṭawng danglam le ṭawng harsatakhai, an ṭawnghai i hriet thei nawhai kuoma tir i ni nawh. Matheiloin, an kuomah ka tir che chun, i thu chu ngai ding chu an nih a."
7,But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart.,"Amiruokchu, Israel sûngkuohai chun i thu ngai naw ni hai a, keia thu an ngai naw ding leiin; Israel sûngkuohai po po chu chal changtak, lungril ngartak ruok an ni leiin."
8,"Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.","Ngai ta, i hmêl chu an hmaisana chun ka sukngar tah a, an chalhai hmaihmaa chun i chal chu ka sukchang ta bawk a nih."
9,"As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.","Lungrâl chu meitâwklung nêka a chang lem angin, i chal ka siem tah a; anni chu ṭi dêr naw rawh, anni hei hmua chun beidawng bawk naw la, sûngkaw hel hmangtak ni hai sien- khawm” tiin."
10,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.","Chu nawa khawm ka kuoma chun, “Mihriem naupa, i kuoma thu ka hril ding po pohai chu i nahai chun ngai la, i lungrila chun pawm rawh."
11,"And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.","Chun, fe la, an sal intângnaa chun, i mihai thlahai kuoma chun fe la, an kuomah thu hril la, anni chu hril rawh; an ngai khawmin, an ngaisak naw khawma, ‘Lalpa Pathien chun hieng hin a tih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
12,"Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.","Chun, thlarau chun a mi dawm kâng a, ka hnungtieng chun râwl ri nasatak ang ka hriet a, “Ama hmuna inthawka suok LALPA ropuina chu inpâkin um raw se,” tiin."
13,"And I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.","Thilhringhai thlahai intawk ri le, an sîra tawlailîr kekuolhai tlân khâwm ri nasatak chu a nih ka hriet chu."
14,"So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.","Chuongchun, thlarau chun a mi dawm kâng a, a mi lâk hmang tah a; lungawilotak le lunginsen êm êmin ka fe tah a; chun, LALPA kut chu ka chunga chun a hrât hle a."
15,"Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.","Chun, sal intânghai, Kebar vadung panga Tel-abiba umhai, an umna hmun ngeia chun ka va feh a; chun, an kuomah chutaka chun maktiin ni sari sûng ka ṭhung tah a."
16,"And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, ni sarihai tâwpa chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung a,"
17,"Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.","“Mihriem naupa, Israel sûng- kuo vêngtu dingin ka siem che a nih: chuleiin, ka baua thu chu ngai la, keimaa inthawkin vaulâwkna chu pe rawh."
18,"When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.","Mi rilo kuomah thu ka hril a, ‘Nang chu matheiloin i thi ngei ding a nih,’ ka tih a, ama chu vaulâwkna khawm i lo pêk nawh a, a hringna chu sanhimna dinga mi rilo chu a lampui riloa inthawk hung kîr dinga vau- lâwkna i lo hril si naw chun; chu mi rilo chu ama suol ngeia chun thîng a tih, amiruokchu, a thisen maw chu nangmaa chun ka hung phût ding a nih."
19,"Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.","Amiruokchu, mi rilo chu i vaulâwk a, a rîtlonaa inthawkin amanih, a lampui riloa inthawkin amanih a kîr naw chun a suola chun thîng a tih; nisienlakhawm, nang chun i thla chu sansuok i tih."
20,"Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.","Chu bâkah mi fel chu a felnaa inthawka ân herhmang a, suol a thaw pha chun, ama hmaa chun tlûkna lung ka sieh a, ama chu thi ngei a tih; ama chu vaulâwkna chu i lo pêk naw leiin, a suolnaa chun thîng a ta; chun, a thil fel thawhai chu hriet zing ni ta naw ni; amiruokchu, a thisen maw chu nangma kutah hung phût ka tih."
21,"Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.","Amiruokchu, mi fel chu vau- lâwkna i nei a, mi fel chu a lo suol nawh a, suol a thaw naw chun, ama chu hring ngei a tih; vaulâwkna chu a pawisak lei chun, nang khawma i thla chu sanhim i tih."
22,"And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.","Chun, LALPA kut chu chutaka chun ka chungah a um a, ka kuoma chun, “Tho la, phai tieng fe suok la, chutaka chun inbiekpui ka ti che,” a ta."
23,"Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.","Chun, ka tho a, phaia chun ka fe tah a, chun, ngai ta, Kebar vadung sîra ropuina ka hmu ang el khan, chutaka chun LALPA ropuina chu a ngîr a; chuongchun, bawkkhupin ka tlu tah a."
24,"Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.","Chun, thlarau chu keimaa chun a hung lût a, ka kehai chun a mîn ngîrtir tah a; chun, a mîn biekpui a, ka kuomah, “Fe la, i inah inkhâr khum rawh."
25,"But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:","Chun, nang mihriem naupa, ngai ta, i chunga chun khuopnahai sieng an ta, chuonghai chun khuop an ti cheh a, anni lai chu fe suok naw ti ni:"
26,"and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.","chun, i lei chu i dang chungah inkawptir tlat ka ta, ṭawng thei loin um i ta, an kuoma chun kâwktu ni nâwng i tih, anni chu sûngkaw hel hmang an ni sih a."
27,"But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.","Nisienlakhawm, nanga kuoma thu ka hung hril pha chun, i bau chu hawng ka ta, an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih,’ tîng i tih. A hre taphawt chun lo ngai raw se; a ngaisak naw taphawt chu ngaisak loin um raw se; sûngkaw hel hmang an ni sih a."
