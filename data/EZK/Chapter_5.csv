1,"And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword; as a barber’s razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, kâwlhnâm ngei la la, luvâwtu hmulvâw chem angah hmang la, i lu le i khâkhmul invâw rawh; chun, bûknain bûk la, sam chu ṭhe rawh."
2,"A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.","Khawpui lailunga chun a hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu meiah râwng i ta, chu pha chun khawpui rûnna chu suktlung nîng a ta; a hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat dang chu lâng i ta, a vêlin kâwlhnâmin sât nawi i ta; chun a hmun thuma ṭhe a hmun khat dang chu thliah vawr dar i ta, chu hnunga chun keiin kâwlhnâm kei- dawk ka tih."
3,"And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun tlâwmterek lâng i ta, i puon hmawrah inbâwk i ta."
4,"And of these again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.","Chu chu la nâwk i ta, meiah peilût i tih; meia chun râwng i tih; chun, chutaka inthawk chun Israel in po pohaia chun mei hung suok a tih,” a tih a."
5,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih: “Hi hi Jerusalem chu a nih, hnamhai laia chun ka sie tah a, ramhai chu a vêlin an um a."
6,"And she hath rebelled against mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected mine ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.","Hnamhai nêka rîtlona thawin ka rorêl chunga chun a hel tah a; ram a vêla umhai nêkin ka thuruot chunga chun a hel ta bawk a; ka rorêlhai chu an inkîra, ka thuruothai chu zâwm khawm an zâwm nuom nawh."
7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih: In vêla hnam umhai nêkin in buoi ngun lem a, ka thuruothai in zâwm bawk nawh a, ka rorêlhai in pawm bawk nawh a, in vêla hnamhai dân ang chun in thaw bawk naw leiin;"
8,"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee; and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih: Ngai ta u, kei hin, kei ngei hin ka dodâl cheu a nih; hnamhai mithmua ngei chun nangmaa chun rorêlna chu ka hung tirsuok ding a nih."
9,"And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.","Chun, ka la thaw ngai hlek lo chu nangmaa chun thâwng ka ta, i tir- dakumna lei chun, chuong ang hrim hrim chu thaw khawm thaw nâwk ta ngai naw ningah."
10,"Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on thee; and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds.","Chuongchun, i sûnga chun pa- hai chun naupahai chu fâng an ta, naupahai chun an pahai chu fa bawk an tih; chun, nangmaa chun rorêl chu hung sukthlûng ka ta, nangmaa la mahlahai po po khawm chu thedar vawng ka tih."
11,"Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity.","Chuleiin, ka hring zing angin, i tirdakumna po po le i thilpawrchehai po po chun ka hmun inthieng chu i lo sukpawrche tâk leiin hung sukriral ngei ngei ka ti che a, ka mit khawma hla naw ni cheh a, kei khawma lunginsietna nei bawk naw ning che."
12,"A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.","Nanga hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu hripuiin thîng an ta, i sûnga chun ṭâmnaa fâkzoin um an tih; chun, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu i vêla chun kâwlhnâmah tlûng an ta; chun, a hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat dang chu the dar ka ta, an hnunga chun kâwlhnâm keidawk ka tih."
13,"Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted: and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.","“Chuongchun, ka lunginsenna chu sukpuitling ni tâng a ta, ka lung inthakna chu an chunga chun suktlai tâng ka ta, inhawi ti tâng ka tih; chun, an chunga ka lung inthakna ka sukpuitling pha chun kei LALPA hin ṭhahnemngaia ka lo hril a ni ti hre tâng an tih."
14,"Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.","Chu nawa khawm chun, i vêla hnamhaia le, nang hung fe khêltu- hai po po che mithmua chun râusana le mi ṭawngdawngah siem ka ti cheh a."
15,"So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes (I, Jehovah, have spoken it);","Chuongchun, vauna ṭiumhai le, lunginthak le lunginsennaa rorêlna- hai ka hung suktlung pha chun, i vêla hnam umhai ta ding chun makti ding le, inchûkna ding le, hrânghla le, invaunaa hmang la nîng a tih, kei LALPA hin ka hril tah a nih:"
16,"when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. And I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread;","chu pha chun, an chunga chun ṭâmna thal ṭha nawhai chu sukbo- hmangna dingin, anni sukbohmang- na dinga ka hung tir ding chu, hung tir ka ta, beia in ringsan khawm chu suktliek ka ta;"
17,"and I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.","in chunga chun ramsa ṭha naw- hai le ṭâmhai hung tir ka ta; nau insûntir an ti cheu; chun, hripuihai le thisen chu nangmaa chun fe thleng a ta; i chunga chun kâwlhnâm ka hung lâk suok ding a nih; kei, LALPAIN ka hril ta a ni hi,” tiin."
