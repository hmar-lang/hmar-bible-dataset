1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:
2,"Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them:","“Mihriem naupa, Ammon thlahai tieng chun i hmai innghat la, an chungchânga chun thu hril rawh;"
3,"and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity:","Ammon thlahai kuoma chun hieng hin hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN thu chu lo ngai unla, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih: Ka hmun inthieng chu sukhmingsiet a ni laiin le, Israel ram chu râusan a ni laiin le, Juda sûngkuo chu sala an intâng lai khan, ‘I hih,’ i lo ti tâk lei khan;"
4,"therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.","ngai ta, an nei ding chein khaw- sak mi thlahai kuoma chun ka pêk ding che a nih; an chêngna hmunhai chu i sûnga chun siem an ta, an umna hmunhai chu innghat an tih; chun, i tui chu dâwnin i nênetui khawm chu dâwn bawk an tih."
5,"And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Rabba chu sanghâwngseihai ta dinga inah siem ka ta, Ammon thlahai hmun chu berâmhai ta dinga bawk khâwmna hmunah siem ka tih; chun, LALPA ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih."
6,"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel;","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti sih a; Israel ram chunga hin i lungrila hmusitna po po leh i lo lâwm tah a, i kehai i lo tet a, i kuthai i lo ben tâk leiin;"
7,"therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.","ngai ta, ka kut chu i chungah kân let tah a, hnamhai kuoma chun râllâk sum dingin ka pêk ding che a nih; chun, hnamhai laia inthawkin sât- thlâng ka ti cheh a; ramhaia in- thawka bohmang dingin siem ka ti che; chun, sukbohmang ka ti cheh a, chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng i tih."
8,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations;","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Moab le Seir chun, ‘Ngai ta u, Juda sûngkuo hi hnam dang po pohai ang bawk a nih,’ an ti leiin,"
9,"therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,","Ngai ta, Moab sîr khat, khawpui hmawrtâwnghaia inthawkin, a ram ropuina Beth-jesimoth, Baal-meon le Kiriathaim tieng chu ka hawng ding a nih;"
10,"unto the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations:",saktieng mihai thlahai kuoma chun an nei dingin Ammon thlahai leh pêng ka tih; Ammon thlahai chu hnamhai laia hriet zing a ni ta nawna dingin.
11,and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.,"Chun, Moab chunga chun rorêl- na chu sukthlûng ka ta; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
12,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Edom hi Juda sûngkuo chungah phuba lain le, maw nasatak inphurtirin le, an chunga thungin a lo sawisak tâk leiin,"
13,"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Edom chunga chun ka kut inlet ka ta, amaa inthawk chun ramsa le mihriem khawm sât thlâng ka tih, Temana inthawkin râusanah siem ka ta; Dedan chenin kâwlhnâmah tlûng an tih."
14,"And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, ka mi Israelhai kut hmangin Edom chunga chun ka phuba lâkna chu sieng ka ta, ka ṭitumna ang pei le ka lunginsenna ang peiin Edoma chun thâwng an tih; chuongchun, ka phuba lâk chu hre tâng an tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
15,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity;","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Philistin mihai chu phuba lâk angin an lo sawisakin, theida zing zinga sukse dingin lungrila hmusit pumin phuba an lo lâk a,"
16,"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.","chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, Philistin mihai chunga chun ka kut inlet ka ta, Kereth mihai chu sât thlâng ka ta, tuipui panga mi um sun hai chu sukbohmang ka tih."
17,"And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.","Chun, kâwkna ṭiumtak leh phubalâkna nasatak chu intlungtir ka ta; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih; ka phubalâkna chu an chunga kân nghat pha chun,” tiin."
