1,"And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward (for the forefront of the house was toward the east); and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.","Chun, in kawtkhâra chun a mi ṭhuoi kîr nâwk a; chun, ngai ta, in tuolpûk saktieng panga chun tui hi a suok a, (chu in hmai chu saktieng ngha a ni sih a); chun, tui chu a hnuoia inthawk chun, in changtieng pangah, mâichâm simtieng panga inthawk chun a hung luong thla a."
2,"Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.","Chun, hmârtienga dâi kawtkhâr lampuia chun a mi ṭhuoi suok tah a; dâi kawtkhâr saktieng ngha lam- puiah, dâi kawtkhâr puo lem lampuia chun a mi ṭhuoi vêl a; chun, ngai ta, chu changtieng panga chun tui chu a hung luong suok a."
3,"When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.","Mi a kuta thil tluon chawia sak- tienga fe peia inkhiin, tawng sâng khat ân khi a, kemit chen tlum tui chu a mîn fekaitir a."
4,"Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the loins.","Chun, tawng sâng ân khi nâwk a, tui khûp tlumah, tui chu a mîn fe- kaitir nâwk a. Chun, sâng ma ân khi nâwk a, tui kâwng tlumah, tui chu a mîn fekaitir nâwk a."
5,"Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.","Chu hnunga chun sâng ân khi nâwk a, vadungpui a hung ni tah a, ka fethleng thei ta nawh a; tui chu a hung insâng a, vadungpui kai thei- lo hiel, inhlieuna khawp a hung ni tah a."
6,"And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, hi hi i hmu am?” a tih a. Chun, a mi ṭhuoi a, vadungpui kamah a mîn kîrtir nâwk tah a."
7,"Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.","Chun, chuonga ka kîr lai chun, ngai ta, vadungpui kama chun hi tieng sîr le khing tieng sîra khawm chun thing tamtak an um a."
8,"Then said he unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea shall the waters go which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Hieng tuihai hi saktieng rama in- thawka hung suok an na, Arabaa chun fe thlâng an ta; chun, tuisuoriet tieng fe pei an ta, tuipui tui al chu tui inthiengah inchangtir an tih."
9,"And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, and the waters of the sea shall be healed, and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh.","Chun, thilhring tinrêng vadung- puihai fena tieng tienga hung in- khâwmhai chu hring an tih; chun, nga tamtak el hung um an ta; chuong- chun, vadungpui luongna phawta tuipui tuihai ân thiengna ding le thil tinrênghai an hring theina dinga hung luong an nih."
10,"And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.","Chun, nga mantuhai chu a sîra chun ngîr an ta, En-gedia inthawka En-eglaim chenin lênhai dêngna hmun a ni ding a nih; an ngahai chu chi tum tum, tuisuoriet lientak nga- hai angin a tama tam nîng an tih."
11,"But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.","Amiruokchu, chutaka dûm hmunhai le dieldâwk hmunhai chu sukthieng ni naw ni hai a, chi dinga mâksan ni lem an tih."
12,"And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.","Chun, vadungpui pang sîra chun hi tienga le khingtieng sîra khawm bua ring dingin thinghai ṭo an ta; an hna vuoi ngai naw ni a; an ra khawm hrût ngai bawk naw nih; thla kipin ra thar hung insuong an ta, an ta dingin tuihai hmun inthienga inthawka a hung luong zing leiin; an rahai chu bua ring ding nîng a ta, an hnahai chu sukdamna ding nîng an tih,” a ta."
13,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: “Israel hnam sâwmpahni ang peia rochan dinga ram chu i semna ding, ramri chu hi hi nîng a tih: Josef khawma chan hni a nei ding a nih."
14,"And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I sware to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.","Chun, hluong in ta, inang seng- in; chu dinga in thlatuhai kuoma pe dinga ka bân ka lo phar tah, hi ram hi in ta dinga rochan dingin a tlu ding a nih."
15,"And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad;","Hi hi hmârtienga ramri chu nîng a tih; tuisuoriet liena inthawka Hethlon lampui zuiin, Zedad lûtna chenin;"
16,"Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.","Hamath le, Berotha dâm, Si- braim dâm, chu chu Damaska ramri le Hamath ramri inkâra chun a um a; Hazer-hattikon chu Hauran ramri sîra chun a um bawk a."
17,"And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.","Chun, tuisuorieta inthawka ramri chu Damaska ramria Hazar- enon ramri kha ning a ta; chun hmârtieng chun hmâr khawin Hemath ramri chu a um. Hi hi hmârtieng pang a nih."
18,"And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border, unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side.","Saktieng panga chun, Hauran le Damaska le Gilead le Israel ram inkâra chun, Jordan chu um a ta; hmârtieng ramria inthawk chun saktieng tuisuoriet chen chu inkhi ding a nih. Hi hi saktieng chu nîng a tih."
19,"And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, unto the great sea. This is the south side southward.","Chun, simtienga sim khâw zâwnga chun, Tamara inthawka Meriboth-kades tuihai chen le, Aigupta vadungtê hrawin, tuisuoriet lienah. Hi hi sim tienga, sim khâw zâwng chu a nih."
20,"And the west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.","Thlangtienga chun tuisuoriet lien nîng a ta, simtieng ramria in- thawka Hamath hang lûtna ep chen khan. Hi hi thlangtieng pang chu nîng a tih."
21,So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.,"Chuongchun, ram chu Israel hnam ang peiin nangni lai chun insem in tih."
22,"And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.","Chun, in ta dinga rochan ding le, nangni laia pêm mikhuol um vehai hi hnunga thlahai la nei dinghai ta ding chun aisânin sem in ta; Israel thlahai laia chun anni chu in ina pieng ang bawk nîng an tih; Israel hnam nangni laia chun rochan chu an chang ve ding a nih."
23,"And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, chu pêm chu a tu hnama khawm lo mikhuol sien, chu hnama chun ama chu a rochan chu pêk nîng a tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
