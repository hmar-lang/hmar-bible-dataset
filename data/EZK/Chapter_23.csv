1,"The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a:
2,"Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:","“Mihriem naupa, Nuhmei pahni, nu pakhat naunuhmeihai chu an um a;"
3,"and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.","Aiguptaa chun nawchizawr sin an thawh a, an tleirâwla inthawkin nawchizawr sin chu an thaw a na, an nênehai chu hmet a na, chuongchun, an nunghâk inthiengna nêne chu hmet zêk a na."
4,"And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.","An hminghai chu, a upa lem chu Ohola a na, a sangnu chu Oholiba a nih; ka ta an hung ni a, naupasalhai le naunuhmeihai an hung nei tah a. Chun, an hming thua chun Ohola chu Samaria a na, Oholiba chu Jerusalem chu a nih."
5,"And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,","Chun, Ohola chun ka ta a ni sûng khawm chun nawchi a zawr a; a dit zâwnghai a tuolbâwm Assuria mihai ân saipuia,"
6,"who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.","a dum pâwla incheihai, ram awp- tuhai le rorêltuhai le tlangvâl ditumtak tak sakawr chung chuong mi sakawr chunga chuonghai chu."
7,"And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.","An kuoma chun a nawchizawrna chu a pêk a, an rêng chun Assuria mi ditumtak takhai an na, chun, tukhawm ân saipui taphawthai chu, an milimhaia chun ama chu ân suk- pawrche ve pei tah a."
8,"Neither hath she left her whoredoms since the days of Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her.","Aiguptaa umna nihaia inthawk ta khan a nawchizawr chu a ma nawh a, a tleirâwl lai an lo zâlpui a; a nunghâk inthieng nêne hmûrhai chu an lo sukhliem ta sih a; chuongchun, an hurna chu a chunga chun an lo bunthlâk tah a."
9,"Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.","Chuleichun, a hmangaihai kut- ah, a însaipui Assuria mihai kuta chun ka pêk suok tah a."
10,These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments upon her.,"Chuonghai chun a saruokna chu an hlîmpêk a, a naupasalhai le a naunuhmeihai chu an lâkpêk a; ama le chun kâwlhnâmin an that a, ama chu nuhmeihai laia ṭawngnaa hmang a lo ni tah a, ama chunga chun rorêlna chu an lo sukthlûk ta sih a."
11,"And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.","“Chun, a unaunu Oholiba khawm chun hi hi a hmu zing a, anachu, ama chu a mi insaipuinaa chun ama nêk hin nasatakin ân suksiet lemin, a nawchizawrnaa khawm chun a unau- nu nawchizawrna nêkin a nasa lem a."
12,"She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.","Ama chun Assuria mihai, ram awptuhai, rorêltuhai, a tuolbâwmhai chu, ropuitaka incheihai, sakawr chung chuong mi sakawr chunga chuonghai, an rênga tlangvâl ditum- tak takhai chu ân saipui a."
13,And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.,"Chun, ama chu an sukpawrche ti ka hmuh a, an pahni chun lampui thuhmun an hraw leiin."
14,"And she increased her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,","Chun, a nawchizawrna chu a sukzuol pei a, bang chunga chun mihriemhai lim zieka umhai chu a hmu sih a; Kaldaihai lim sen mawia incheia ziek,"
15,"girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them princes to look upon, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.","an kâwnghaia kâwngkhitnaa inkhit an luhaia lukâwm sukdum kâwma, hang en khawma lalhai ang, an piengna rama Kaldaia Babulon mi nina nei chie ruok an nih."
16,"And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.","Chun, a hmu phingle chun ama chun ân saipui a; Kaldaia chun an kuomah mitirhai a tir a."
17,"And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.","Chun, Babulon mi chu a kuoma inditna khuma chun a hung a, an nawchizawrna chun ama chu an sukpawrche a, anni le chun a lo pawr- che tah a, a lungril chun anni chu a ngei ta hle a."
18,"So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.","Chuongchun, a nawchizawrna chu langchangtaka a thaw a, a saruokna a hlîm chun, ka lungril chu amaa inthawk chun ân her a, a unaunua inthawka ka lungril a lo inher ta ang bawk khan."
19,"Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.","Nisienlakhawm, Aigupta rama nawchizawr thil a thaw lai, a tleirâwl lai nihai chu hre zingin, a hurnahai chu a la belsa ta rawp a."
20,"And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.","An tisa khawm sabengtunghai tisa ang, an thilsuok khawm sakawr- hai thilsuok ang, an mi lepchiehai chu ân saipui a."
21,"Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.","Chuongchun, Aigupta rama i tleirâwl lai nênehai an hmeta, a hmûrhai an hmet zêk lai a, i tleirâwl- lai hurna chu i ngai a."
22,"Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:","“Chuleiin, Oholiba, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Ngai ta, i dit zâwnghai chu i chungah hung inṭuongtir ka ta; i lungrilin a hran- sanhai chu, sîr tina chun i chungah inhungtir ka tih;"
23,"the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.","Babulon mihai, Kaldai mihai po po le, Pekod mihai, Soa mihai, Hoa mihai, anni le Assuria mihai po po leh; tlangvâl ditumtak takhai, ram awptuhai, rorêltuhai, an rêngin lal nauhai, mi hming inthanghai, an rêngin sakawr chunga chuong mihai chu."
24,"And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will commit the judgment unto them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.","Chun, nanga chunga chun hriemhreihai, sakawr tawlailîrhai, tawlailîrhai, mipui inkhâwm nasa- tak leh hung do an ti cheh a; a vêlin, thîr lukhumhai, âwmphawhai le phawhai leh an hung ep ding che a nih; chun, an kuoma chun rorêlna dân ang peiin i chungah rorêlpêk an ti che."
25,"And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.","I chunga chun ka îtthîkna chu sieng ka ta, i chunga chun lunginsen pumin thâwng an tih; i hnâr le i nahai chu la hmang an ta; i la mahlahai chu kâwlhnâmah tlûng an tih; i naupa- salhai, i naunuhmeihai chu lâng an ta, i la mahlahai chu meiin kâng hmang vawng a tih."
26,"They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.","Chun, nang khawm i silfênhai chu hlîppêk an ti cheh a, în cheina man tamhai chu la hmang an tih."
27,"Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.","Chuongchun, Aigupta rama i nawchizawrna hung lâk le, i hurna chu nangmaa inthawka bo ta dingin siem ka ta; chuongchun, anni chu i mithai chun mel ta ngai naw nih a, Aigupta chu hre zing ta bawk naw ti nih."
28,"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated;","Hieng hin Lalpa PATHIEN chun a ti sih a: Ngai ta, i theidahai kuta le, i lungrilin a hransanhai kuta chun ka pêk suok ding che a nih;"
29,"and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.","theida hlêng an ti cheh a, i sinthaw inrimna po po chu la hmang vawng an ta, saruok le silfên boin mâksan an ti che; chun, i hurna saruokna chu hlîm nîng a ta, i hurna le i nawchizawrna chu."
30,"These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols.","Hieng thilhai hi i chungah thawin a um ding a nih; khawhri be mihai hnung chu châkin i lo hnawt tah a, an milimhai chun i lo insuk- pawrche ta si leiin."
31,Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.,"I unaunu lampuia chun i lo fe tah a; chuleiin, ama no chu i kutah ka pêk ding a nih."
32,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: I unaunu no tung lientak chu i dâwn ding a nih, Hmusita nuisanin um i ta, hrilinsîm ni bawk i tih, A keng râwn hle sih a;"
33,"Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.","Lungngaina le inruinain sip tâng i ta, Râusanna le maktina no, i zuorpuinu Samaria no le chun Dâwn khawm dâwn ngei i ta, thlâksuok i ta,"
34,"Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chutaka a nâwihai chu, sawi i ta, I nênehai chu sukhliem i tih; Ka lo hril ta sih a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
35,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.","“Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Kei i mi lo theinghil tah a, i hnungah i mi pei tah a, chuleiin, i hurna le i nawchizawr- nahai chu nangin phur rawh,” tiin."
36,"Jehovah said moreover unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations.","Chu nawa khawm chun LALPA chun ka kuomah a hril a, “Mihriem naupa, Ohola le Oholiba chungthu hi i rêl ding am? an tirdakumnahai chu anni hril la."
37,"For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass through the fire unto them to be devoured.","An lo uire ta sih a, an kuthaia chun thisen a kai a; an milimhai chun uiretna thil chu an lo thaw tah a; chun, an naupasalhai an mi neipêk- hai khawm chu, an kuomah fâk zoa um dingin meia chun an infethleng- tir a."
38,"Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.","Chu naw khawm chu hi hi ka chungah an thaw bawk a; a ni pâng- ngaia ma chun ka hmun inthieng chu an sukpawrcheh a, ka châwlnihai khawm chu an lo bawsiet tah a."
39,"For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.","An milimhai kuoma an nauhai an that laiin, chu nia ma chun ka hmun inthieng chu sukpawrche dingin an hung sih a; chun, ngai ta, ka in sûnga chun chuong ang chun an thaw a nih."
40,"And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,","Chu nawa chun, hlataka in- thawka hung ding mihai ta ding chun mi i tir a, an kuoma chun mitir chu tir a na; chun, ngai ta, an hung tah a; chuong ta ding chun în sâwp a, i mithai i nâl a, incheinahaiin în chei a;"
41,"and sit upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil.","lal khum a hmaa dawkân buot- saia um chunga chun i ṭhung a, chu chunga chun ka riminhnikhai le ka hriek chu i sie kha."
42,"And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of them twain, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.","Chun, mipui râwl inhawitihai chu a kuoma chun a um a; chun, mi chi narânhai le chun thlalêra in- thawkin zu inrui mihai chu hung ṭhuoi an na. An kuthaia chun bân- bunhai chu a thuoin an inbuntir a, an luhai chunga chun lallukhum mawi- takhai le chun."
43,"Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they play the harlot with her, and she with them.","Chun, kei chun uirea a upa lemnu kuoma chun, ‘Tuhin anni chun ama le uiretna thil chu an thawin, ama khawma anni leh a thaw ding am aw?’ ka tih a."
44,"And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women.","Nuhmei nawchizawr hlak kuoma an lût hlak angin, anni chu ama kuoma chun an lût tah a; chuongchun, nuhmei hur, Ohola le Oholiba kuoma chun an lût tah a."
45,"And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.","Mi felhai chun, anni chu uirenu chunga rorêl ang le, nuhmei thisen insuotu chunga rorêl angin rorêlpêk an tih; uirenuhai an na, an kutahai chun thisen a kai bawk si leiin."
46,"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti sih a; An chungah mipui in- khâwm hung ṭhuoi ka ta, anni chu a suk a tunga vawrlênga suksiet dingin an kuomah pêng ka tih."
47,"And the company shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.","Chun, mipui inkhâwmhai chun anni chu lungin dêng an ta; an kâwl- hnâmhai chun that an ta; an naupa- salhai le an naunuhmeihai chu that an ta, an inhai chu meiin raw hâwp an tih."
48,"Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.","Chuongchun, hurna chu chu rama inthawka bo dingin siem ka ta, nuhmeihai po po chu in hurna ang thaw lo dinga inchûktir an ni theina dingin."
49,"And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, in hurna chu in chungah thung an ti cheu a, in milimhai suolna chu phur in ta, chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih,” tiin."
