1,"And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, Israel tlânghai chungah thu hril la, hieng hin hril rawh, Nangni Israel tlânghai, LALPA thu chu hre ro."
2,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession;","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Hmêlma chun i chunga chun, ‘I hi! tienlaia bâwlhmunhai chu ei ta a ni tah,’ an ti khum che leiin;"
3,"therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;","hril la, hieng hin ti rawh; Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih; râusanah an lo siem ta che leiin le, sîr tina inthawk chun an lo lem ta cheh a, hnam la umhai ta dinga chan i ni theina dingin, thuhriltuhai hmûra chun i chuong a, mipuihai thuhril ṭha lo i lo ni tâk leiin;"
4,"therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about;","nangni Israel tlânghai, Lalpa PATHIEN thu chu lo ngai ta u; Tlâng- hai kuoma dâm, muolhai kuoma dâm, tui luongnahai kuoma dâm, phai- ruom kuoma dâm, khawpui mâksana um le suksieta râusana umhai kuoma dâm, an sîrvêla hnamhai la um sun- hai ifâk zo le hrilsîma lo um tahai kuoma chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih;"
5,"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Matheiloin, hnam la um sunhai chunga le, Edom po po chungah ka thîkna meiin thu hril ngei ka ta; anni chun an lungril inhawi ti zâwng ang po poa nei dingin lungrila hmusitna le, fâk zoa um dinga pei suok el dingin ka ram chu an lo ruot tah a."
6,"Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the shame of the nations:","“Chuleichun, Israel ram chung- châng thua chun thu hril la, tlânghai kuoma dâm, muolhai kuoma dâm, tui luongnahai kuoma dâm, phairuom- hai kuoma dâm chun hril la; Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih; Ngai ta, hnam danghai biekrâwpna chu i lo phur tâk leiin, ka lunginsenna le ka itthîknain thu ka lo hril tah a;"
7,"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have sworn, saying, Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame.","chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Khawhri be mihai nangni vêla umhai po po chun anni biekrâwpna anni ngeiin an phur ngei ding a nih, tiin, ka bân ka lo phar tah a."
8,"But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come.","Nisienlakhawm, nangni, Aw Israel tlânghai, in kauhai chu in- zâmdawktir in ta, in rahai chu ka mi Israelhai in pêk ding a nih; hung nghâl el ding an ni sih a."
9,"For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;","Ngai ta u, kei chu in ta ding ka ni sih a; in kuomah hung kîr ka ta, chun, inlet le chîng nîng in tih;"
10,"and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded;","chun, nangniah mihai, Israel sûngkuo po po chu, an rêng elin, sukpung ka ta, khawpuihai chu hluoin um an ta, hmun suksieta um tahai khawm chu siem nîng an tih;"
11,"and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","in sûnga chun mihriem le sa khawm sukpung ka ta; pung an ta, ra hlâwk an tih; chun, a hmaa in lo um dân pângngai ang bawk khan hluoa um dingin siem ka ti che a, in um ṭantir lai nêk hman khan in chungah thaw ṭha lem ka tih; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih."
12,"Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.","Anih, in chunga chun mihai inlâwntir ka ta, ka mi Israelhai ngei chun nei an ti cheh a, nang chu an rochan hung nîng i tih; chuong- chun, chu chena inthawk chu an thlahai chu thisanin inumtir ta naw ti ni."
13,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you, Thou land art a devourer of men, and hast been a bereaver of thy nation;","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: I kuoma chun, ‘Nang ram mi- hriem fa zotu i na, i hnamhai chu sukrêmtu i nih,’ an ti che leiin,"
14,"therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;","chuleiin, mihriem hrim hrim chu fa zo ta ngai naw ti nih a, i hnamhai khawm chu sukrêm ta ngai bawk naw ti ni, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih;"
15,"neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.","chun, hnamhai inzakna chu inhriettir ta ngai bawk naw ning cheh a, hnamhai kâwkna chu phur ngai ta bawk naw ti ni; chun, i hnamhai chu insuithlu dingin siem nâwk ta ngai bawk naw ti ni, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
16,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",Chu nawa khawm chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a.
17,"Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.","“Mihriem naupa, Israel sûng- kuo chu anni ram ngeia an chêng lai khan, an thil thawhai le an lampuihai chun an sukpawrcheh a; an lampui chu ka kuoma chun nuhmei ân siehran laia ân thieng nawna ang chu a nih."
18,"Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;","Chuleiin, ram chunga an lo bunthlâk thisen chunga chun ka lunginsenna chu ka bunthlâk a; an milimhaia an lo sukpawrche ta leiin;"
19,"and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.","hnamhai laia chun ka sukdar tah a, rambunghaia chun an lo indar tah a; an um dân ang pei le, an thil thawhai ang peiin an chunga chun ro ka rêl a."
20,"And when they came unto the nations, whither they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and are gone forth out of his land.","Chun, hnamhai laia an hung chun, an fena tieng tieng ka hming inthieng chu an sukpawrcheh a; chu- taka chun mihai chun, ‘Hienghai hi LALPA mihai chu an na, a rama inthawka suokhai chu an nih,’ an tih a."
21,"But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they went.","Nisienlakhawm, Israel sûng- kuohaiin an fena tieng tienga an sukpawrche tah, ka hming inthieng chu ka lunginsiet a."
22,"Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye went.","“Chuleiin, Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun hieng hin hril la; Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Aw Israel sûngkuo, hi hi nangni leia thaw ka ni nawh a, amiruokchu, ka hming inthieng, in fena tieng tienga hnam- hai laia in lo sukpawrche ta lei khan a ni lem."
23,"And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.","Chun, ka hming ropuitak chu, hnamhai laia sukpawrchea lo um tah, anni laia in lo sukpawrche ta chu sukthieng ka ta; chuongchun, hnam- hai chun LALPA chu ka nih, ti mi hre tâng an tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; an mithmua nangnia sukthienga ka um pha chun."
24,"For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.","Hnamhai laia inthawk chun ṭhuoi ka ti cheu a, rambung po poa inthawkin kei khâwm ka ti cheu a, in rama ngei chun ṭhuoi ka ti cheu."
25,"And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.","Tui inthieng chu thinkhum ka ti cheu a, inthieng tâng in tih; in in- thiengnawna po poa inthawk le in milimhai po poa inthawkin sukthieng ka ti cheu."
26,"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.","Lungril thar pêng ka ti cheu a, thlarau thar nangniah sie bawk ka tih; chun, in tisaa inthawkin lungril lung ang chu la hmang ka ta, tisa lungril innêm pe lem ka ti cheu."
27,"And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them.","Nangnia chun ka thlarau sieng ka ta, ka thuruothai chu inhrawtir ka ti cheu a, ka thupêkhai chu zâwm in ta, thaw bawk in tih."
28,"And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.","In thlatuhai kuoma ram ka pêka chun chêng in ta, nangni chu ka mihai nîng in ta, kei khawm in Pathien nîng ka tih."
29,"And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.","Chun, in inthiengnawna po poa inthawkin sandam ka ti cheu a, chun, bu ko ka ta, sukpung ka ta, in chung- ah ṭâm inumtir naw ningah."
30,"And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.","Thing rahai le hnuoi ra hlâwk- hai chu sukpung ka ta, hnamhai laia chun ṭâm leia deusâwna tuok ta ngai naw ti niu."
31,"Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.","Chun, in lampui rilohai le, in thilthaw ṭha nawhai chu hre zing in ta; chuongchun, in tirdakumnahai le in suolnahai leiin in mithmu ngeia chun nangni le nangni chu inten in tih."
32,"Nor for your sake do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.","Hi thil hi nangni leia thaw ka ni nawh ti hi nangni ihriet ni raw se, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; aw Israel sûngkuo, in um dânhaia chun buoi unla, inzak ro."
33,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; In suolnahai po poa in- thawka ka sukthieng ni cheu chun, khawpuihai chu hluoa um dingin siem ka ta, hmun se tahai khawm chu bâwl nîng an tih."
34,"And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.","A fethlengtuhai mithmua râu- sana a lo um ta angin, ram râusana lo um ta khawm chu inlet nîng a ta."
35,"And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.","Anni chun, ‘Ram râusana lo um ta hi, Eden huon ang a hung ni nâwk a; khawpui se tah, suksieta um taha râusana um tahai khawm chu hluo an ni tah,’ tîng an tih."
36,"Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.","Chun, nangni vêla hnam mâk- sana la umhai po po chun kei LALPA ngei hin hmun se tahai chu ka bâwlin, râusana um tahai khawm ka tungding a nih ti hre tâng an tih; kei LALPA ngeiin ka hril tah a, thaw bawk ka tih."
37,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Hi hi dinga khawm hin, an ta dinga thawpêk dingin, Israel sûng- kuo mi râwnin um bawk ka tih; anni chu berâm ruol angin mihriem sukpung ka tih."
38,"As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Inthawina dinga berâm ruol ang, a ruoiṭhena hun bia Jerusalema berâm ruol angin, khawpui se ta- hnunghai chu mihriema suksip nîng an ta, chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
