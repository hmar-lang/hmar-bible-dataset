1,"The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a;
2,"Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art man, and not God, though thou didst set thy heart as the heart of God;—","“Mihriem naupa, Tura lal kuoma chun hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih; i lungril chu chawisângin a um a, Pathien ka na, Pathien ṭhungphaa chun ka ṭhung a, tuisuoriethai lairila chun i ti leiin i lungril chu Pathien lungrilah ngai la khawm, mihriem i ni si a, Pathien ni loin;"
3,"behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is hidden from thee;","ngai ta, Daniel nêkin i var lem a nih; nangmaa inthawka thup thei ding thurûk hrim hrim a um nawh a,"
4,"by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures;","i varna lei le i hrietthiemna leiin hausaknahai în siempêk a, i ro inhaia chun rângkachak le tangkahai i nei a,"
5,"by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches;—","I varna nasatak le i sumdâwng- naa chun i hausaknahai chu i suk- pung a, i hausakna lei chun i lungril chu a lo insâng tah a,"
6,"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God,","chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih; I lungril chu Pathien lungril anga i siem tâk leiin,"
7,"therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.","chuleiin, ngai ta, i chungah mikhuolhai ka hung ṭhuoi ding a nih, hnamhai ṭisimtak el chu; i varna mawina chunga chun an kâwlhnâm- hai chu phawi an ta; i tlêtna chu sukpawrchêng an tih."
8,"They shall bring thee down to the pit; and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain, in the heart of the seas.","Khur sûnga chun la thlâng an ti cheh a, thata um tahai thîna anga chun, tuisuoriet lairila chun thîng i tih."
9,"Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou art man, and not God, in the hand of him that woundeth thee.","Nangma sukhlumtu che hmaa chun, ‘Pathien chu ka nih,’ i la ti rawp ding am a nih? Mihriem chau i ni sih a, Pathien ni lo, nangma inhliemtu che kuta chun."
10,"Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Mikhuolhai kuta chun sertan- lohai thi angin thîng i ta, keiin ka lo hril ta sih a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
11,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",Chu nawa khawm chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:
12,"Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.","“Mihriem naupa, Tura lal ta dingin sûnna hla siem la, a kuoma chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih: Ṭha famkim, varnaa sip le mawinaa famkim i na,"
13,"Thou wast in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee; in the day that thou wast created they were prepared.","Pathien huon Edena chun i lo um tah a; Lunghlu tinrênghai chu i în khumna a na, Hieng sardion dâm, topaz dâm, rubi lung dâm, onik dâm, jaspi dâm, Sapphir dâm, karbankle dâm, lunghlu dang dang le, Rângkachakhai, an inṭhutna le ziek kermawihai, Kut themthiema siemhai chu i sûnga chun an um a. Nang chu siema i um ni chun chuonghai chu buotsai an ni veh a."
14,"Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, so that thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.","Cherub hrieknâla um, zârkhumtu chu i na, Kân umtir cheh a, Pathien tlâng inthienga chun i um a, Mei lunghai laia chun a suk a tungin i lo inlawn tah a:"
15,"Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.","Felnâwna nangmaa hmu suok a ni hmakhat khan chu, Siema i um nia inthawk khan i lampuia chun i ṭhafamkim hlak a."
16,"By the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.","I sumdâwngna thil tam taluot leiin, I sûng chu inpâwngnêknain an suksip tah a; Thil i suksuol a, chuleiin, sukpawrchea um angin, Pathien tlânga inthawk chun ka hnawt suok ta cheh a, Ka suksiet ta che a nih, aw inkhumtu cherub, Mei lunghai laia chun ka suksiet che a nih."
17,"Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground; I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee.","I mâwina leiin i lungril a lo insâng tah a, I tlêtna lei chun i varna chu i lo suksiet tah a, Hnuoiah ka pei thlawr cheh a, An hmu theina ding chein lalhai hmaa chun kân zâltir che a nih."
18,"By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee; it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.","I sumdâwngnaa fel nâwnaa suolna tam leiin, I hmun inthienghai chu i lo sukpawrche tah a; Chuleiin, i sûnga inthawk mei ka hung lâk suok a, A kâng hmang cheh a, hnuoia pilvutah kân changtir cheh a, Nangma entuhai po po che mithmua chun,"
19,"All they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being.","Hnamhai laia nanga hretuhai po po che chun maktîng an ta, Nang chu mi ṭîsim i ni tah a, um khawm um nâwk ta naw ti nih,” tiin."
20,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a:"
21,"Son of man, set thy face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,","“Mihriem naupa, Sidon tieng chun i hmai innghat la, a chungah thu hril rawh,"
22,"and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.","hieng hin ti la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, aw Sidon, ka dodâl che a nih, I sûnga chun ka ropuina suklang ka tih: Chuongchun, LALPA ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih, Amaa ka rorêlnahai chu ka sukpuitling a, Ama ka sukthieng pha chun;"
23,"For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","A kawtthlêrhaia chun thisen le hripuihai ka hung tir ding a ni sih a, Chun, a hliemhai chu sîr tinah an chunga kâwlhnâmhai leh tlûng an tih. Chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti hre tâng an tih."
24,"And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are round about them, that did despite unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.","“Chun, Israel sûngkuoa chun a suntu hling um ta naw nih a, an sîr vêla hling buoipuiumhai anni suk- hmingse dinghai chu um ta naw nih a, chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
25,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih; Israel sûngkuohai chu sukdara an umna hnamhai laia inthawka ka lâk khâwm a, hnamhai mithmu ngeia annia sukthienga ka um pha chun, ka siehlaw Jakob kuoma ka lo pêk tah, anni rama ngei khan chêng tâng an tih."
26,"And they shall dwell securely therein; yea, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when I have executed judgments upon all those that do them despite round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.","Chutaka chun himtakin chêng an ta; anih, inhai bâwl an ta, grêp huonhai siem an ta, himtakin chêng an tih; anni sîr vêla anni sukpawr- chetuhai chunga ka rorêlna ka suk- puitling pha chun, LALPA an Pathien chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
