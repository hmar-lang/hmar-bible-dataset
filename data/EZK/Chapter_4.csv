1,"Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:","“Nang khawma, mihriem naupa, ṭêklei phêk la la, a chunga chun khawpui, Jerusalem khawpui lim chu inngîr la;"
2,"and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.","chu chu rûn la, kulhaiin bâwl khum la, a vêla chun hnuoi dêng pâwng la, puon inhai kei khum bawk la, chun, a vêl el chun kâphmunhai siem bawk rawh."
3,"And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.","Chun, thîr phêk la la, nang le khawpui inkâra chun bang dingin intung la, chun, i hmai chu chu tieng chu hei innghat la, inhuol angin siem la, chun, nangin inhuol rawh. Hi hi Israel sûngkaw inchikna chu nîng a tih."
4,"Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.","“Chu nawa chun, i vawitieng delin zâl la, i chunga chun Israel sûngkaw suolna chu innghat rawh; chu chu chunga i zâl ni zât ang pei chun, an suolna chu phur i tih."
5,"For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.","An suol kum zât chu i ta ding chun i ni dingin, ni za thum le sâwm- kuo ni dingin ka ruot ta sih a, chuong- chun, Israel sûngkaw suolna chu i phur ding a nih."
6,"And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.","Chun, hi hi i thaw vawng pha chun, i changtieng pang delin zâl nâwk i ta; Juda sûngkaw suolna chu phur thung tâng i tih; ni sâwmli sûng, ni tin chu kum khata dingin, i ta dingin hieng ang hin ka ruot ta sih a."
7,"And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.","Jerusalem rûna um tieng chu i hmai innghat i ta, i bânhai hlîmin, chun, a chungthua chun hrillâwk i tih."
8,"And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.","Chun, ngai ta, khuopnahai i chungah sieng ka ta, i rûnna nihai chu i sukkim hmakhat chun sîr khat sîr khatah în her nawna dingin."
9,"Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof.","Bu le, buṭei le bê le, si le, butun le, havai la la, bêl pakhatah sie la; chutaka inthawk chun bei siem rawh; a sîra i zâl ni zât ang peiin; chu chu ni za thum le sâwmkuo sûng fâng i tih."
10,"And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.","Chun, i bu i fâk ding chu a bûka bûk nîng a ta, ni tina shekel sâwm- hni; hunbi nei takin i fâk chau ding a nih."
11,"And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.","chun, tui khawm inkhi bawkin dâwn i ta, hin hmun ruka ṭhea hmun khat pei, a hunbi nei takin dâwn i tih."
12,"And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.","Chun, an mithmua chun mi- hriem êk leh meiah em i ta, buṭei bei angin fâng i tih,” tiin."
13,"And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.","Chun, LALPA chun, “Chuong ang bawk chun Israel thlahai chun anni ka hnawt hmangna ding hnamhai kuoma chun an bei chu inthieng loin fâng an tih,” a ta."
14,"Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.","Chun, kei chun, “A, Lalpa PATHIEN! ngai ta, kei chu ka lungril khawm sukpawrche a la ni nawh a, ka tleirâwla inthawk tah tu chen hin amaa thi amanih, ramsahaiin an kei nâwi amanih ka fâk ngai nawh a, ka baua hin sa tirdakum hrim hrim a lût ngai nawh,” ka tih a."
15,"Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “En ta, hi mihriem êk aiah bâwng êk ka pêk cheh a, chuongchun, i bei chu i buotsai ding a nih,” a ta."
16,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:","Chu nawa chun, ka kuoma chun, “Mihriem naupa, ngai ta, beia Jerusalem châwmna chu suktâwp ka ta, bei chu inkhia inkhiin fâng an ta, fîmkhurtak elin; chun, tui khawm maktitakin, inkhia inkhiin dâwn bawk an tih;"
17,"that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.","bei le tui chu an tlâksama, anni le anni chu mak an inti senga, an suolnaa chu lâk hmang an ni theina dingin."
