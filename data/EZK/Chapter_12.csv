1,"The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,",LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung nâwk a.
2,"Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.","“Mihriem naupa, nang sûngkaw hel hmang, hmûna dinga mithai nei sih a, hmu lohai, hrietna dinga nahai nei sih a, hre lohai laia chêng, sûng- kaw hel hmang an ni sih a."
3,"Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.","Chuleiin, nang mihriem naupa, sal intâng ding angin thuomhnaw intêl la, sûnah an mithmu ngeiah fe suok rawh; chun, an mithmua chun i hmuna inthawkin hmun dangah insawn rawh; sûngkaw hel hmang an ni nâka chu an ngaituo thei rawi mawh."
4,"And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.","Chun, i thuomhnaw chu sûnah an mithmuah hung la suok i ta, sal intâng ding angin; chun, sal intânga fe dinghai thaw angin zântieng hun- ah an mithmuah nang ngei chu fe suok i ta."
5,"Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.","An mithmua chun bang chu ver âwng la, chutaka chun i thuomhnaw chu la suok rawh."
6,"In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.","An mithmua chun i liengkoah phur i ta, inthima chun phur pei i ta; i hmai khawm hnuoi hmu lo dingin în khum ding a nih; Israel sûngkuohai dinga inchiknaah ka sie ta si cheh a,” tiin."
7,"And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.","Chun, chuonga thu pêka ka um ang tak chun ka thaw tah a; ka thuomhnaw chu sûnah ka hung lâk suok a, sal intâng ding ang tak chun; chun, zântieng chun ka kutin bang chu ka ver âwng a; thuomhnaw chu inthima chun ka hung lâk suok a, an mithmua chun ka liengkoah ka phur tah a."
8,"And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,","Chun, zîngkâr chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
9,"Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?","“Mihriem naupa, Israel sûngkuo, sûngkaw hel hmang chun i kuomah, ‘Ieng am i thawh a?’ an ti che a ni naw maw?"
10,"Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.","an kuoma chun hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, ti rawh, Hi chungrikna hin Jerusalema lal le Israel sûngkuohai po po an umnahai chu a kâwk a nih."
11,"Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.","Hril la, in ta dinga inchikna ka na, ka thaw ta angin an kuoma chun hung tlung a tih, hnawt suoknaa chun, salah an fe ding a nih."
12,"And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.","Anni laia lal um chun inthim hnuoia chun a liengkoin phur a ta, fe suok a tih; chutaka phursuok- na ding chun bang chu ver âwng an tih; a mithaia hnuoi a hmu nawna dingin a hmai chu inkhum tlat a tih."
13,"My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.","Chun, ka lên khawm chu a chunga chun dêngkhum ka ta, ka chânga chun âwk a tih; chun, Kaldai- hai ram Babulona chun ṭhuoi ka ta; chutaka chun thi ding ni sien khawm, hmu chu hmu naw ni."
14,"And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.","Chun, a pâwlhai po po le, ama vêla ama ṭhangpuituhai ding po po chu kil tinah the dar ka ta; an hnunga kâwlhnâm chu phawi ka tih."
15,"And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.","Chun, ramhaia ka hnawt dar pha le, hnamhai laia ka sukdar pha chu LALPA kha ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih."
16,"But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Amiruokchu, anni laia mi tlâwmte chu kâwlhnâma manih, hri- puia manih, ṭâmnaa inthawkin amani chun hlâng ka ta; an fena tieng tienga hnamhai kâwla chun an tirdakumna po po chu an phuongdar theina dingin; chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
17,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,","Chu nawa khawm LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
18,"Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness;","“Mihriem naupa, i bei kha inthin pumin fa la, i tui khawm kha inthin pum le ṭitak pumin dâwn rawh;"
19,"and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and despoiled of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.","chun, kha rama mipuihai kuoma chun, Israel ram le Jerusalem hluotuhai chungthua chun Lalpa PATHIENIN hieng ang hin a tih; an bei chu ṭitumna leh fâng an ta, an tui chu maktina leh dâwn bawk an tih, chutaka chêngtuhai po po pâwng- nêkna leiin, chutaka umhai po pohaia inthawka chu ram chu râusan a ni theina dingin."
20,"And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, khawpui, hluoa umhai chu suksiet nîng a ta, ram chu râusan nîng a tih; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih,” tiin."
21,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
22,"Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?","“Mihriem naupa, hi thuvar Israel rama in inei, ‘Nihai chu sukseiin a um a, thilhmulâwkhai tin chu a puitling ta nawh,’ ti hi ieng tina am a na?"
23,"Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision.","Chuleiin, an kuoma chun hril la, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, ‘Hi thuvar hi suktâwp ka ta, Israel rama chun thuvarah hmang ta naw ni hai; amiruokchu, an kuoma chun hril la; thilhmulâwk thu tin tlungna chu a hnai tah,’ tiin."
24,For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.,"Israel sûngkaw sûnga chun thilhmulâwk teplo amanih, aiena inhlêmna hrim hrim a um ta naw ding a ni sih a."
25,"For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.","LALPA chu ka ni sih a: thu hril ka ta, chu ka thuhril chu thawin a um ngei ding a nih; sukbahla ni ta ngai naw ni; aw sûngkaw hel hmang, in nihaia chun thu hril ka ta, thaw ni bawk a tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
26,"Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a,"
27,"Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.","“Mihriem naupa, ngai ta, Israel sûngkuohai chun hieng hin an ta, ‘Thil hmulâwk a hmuhai hi ni sâwttak la hung tlung dinghaia mi ding chu a na, hun la hlataka mi dinghai chu a lo hril a nih,’ tiin."
28,"Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chuleiin, an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; ka thu hrim hrim chu sukbahla ni ta naw nih a, amiruokchu, thu ka ihril chu thawin a um lem ding a nih,’ Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
