1,"Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.","Chun, Israel upa ṭhenkhat ka kuomah an hung a, ka hmaa chun an ṭhung a."
2,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
3,"Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?","“Mihriem naupa, hieng mihai hin an milimhai chu an lungrilhaia chun an lâk tlat a, an hmaihmaa chun an suolna tlûkna lunghai chu an sie tah a; annihai thu indawn hin ka la um rawp ding am a nih?"
4,"Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I Jehovah will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols;","Chuleiin, an kuoma chun thu hril la, an kuomah, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih, Israel sûngkuo laia mi tukhawm a milimhai chu a lungril sûnga la tlat a, a hmaihmaa a suolna tlûkna lung sietu zâwlnei kuoma hung si chu, keima LALPA ngeiin a milimhai tamzie ang peiin dawn ka tih;"
5,"that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.","an milimhai leia keimaa in- thawka an invâkhmang vawng tâk leiin, Israel sûngkuo chu an lungril- hai ka lâk theina dingin’ tiin."
6,"Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.","Chuleiin, Israel sûngkuo kuoma chun hril la, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Hung kîr unla, in milimhaia inthawkin fe hmang ro; chuongchun, in tirdakumnahai po poa inthawk chun in hmai chu ngha hmang ro."
7,"For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Jehovah will answer him by myself:","Israel sûngkuoa mi tin amanih, Israel rama mikhuol inzin mikhuol amanih khawm keimaa inthawka pêthrana, a milimhai chu lungrila la tlata, a hmaihmaa a suolna tlûkna lung sie a, ama ta dinga ka kuoma thu indawn dinga zâwlnei kuoma hung si chu; kei LALPA ngeiin, keiin dawn ka tih;"
8,"and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","chu mipa chunga chun ka hmai innghat ka ta, thuvara inchikna ding- in thilmakah siem ka ta, ka mihaia inthawk chun ama chu sât thlâng ka tih; chun, LALPA chu ka ni ti mi hre tâng in tih."
9,"And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.","Chun, zâwlnei chu hlêmin a um a, thu a hril chun, kei LALPA hin chu zâwlnei chu ka hlêm a na, ama chunga chun ka kut inlet ka ta, ka mi Israelhai laia inthawkin ama chu sukbohmang ka tih."
10,And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh unto him;,"Chun, an suol maw chu phur an ta; zâwlnei suolna chu mi ama kuom- ah zawngtu suolna ang ngei chu nîng a tih;"
11,"that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Israel sûngkuo chu keimaa inthawka an fe pêt ta nawna ding le, an bawsietnahai po po leia anni an insukpawrche ta nawna dingin; ami- ruokchu, ka mihai an hung ni theia, an Pathien ka ni theina dingin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,’ tiin,” a ta."
12,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
13,"Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast;","“Mihriem naupa, bawsietna thil chu thawin ram chu ka chungah lo suol ta sienla, chun, keiin a chungah ka kut inletin, bei a ringsan chu suksein, a chunga chun ṭâmna tirin, amaa inthawk chun ramsa le mi- hriemhai khawm lo sât thla ta lang;"
14,"though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.","hi mi pathumhai Noa, Daniel le Job hai meu khawm hi a sûnga chun umhai sien, an felna chun anni hringna chau chu an sanhim ding a nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
15,"If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;","Chun, chu ram chu ramsa tuorhlaumhai chun fe thlengin, sukse hai sien, râusana umin, ramsahai lei chun mi fe paw ngam loin umhai sien;"
16,"though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.","a sûnga chun hieng mi pathum- hai hi um hai sienkhawm, Lalpa PATHIEN chun, ‘kei ka hring angin, naupa amanih, naunu amani khawm sanhim naw ni hai a, anni le anni chau insanhim an ta; ram chu râusan nîng a tih’, a tih."
17,"Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast;","Annawleh, chu ram chunga chun kâwlhnâm ka hung intlungtir a, ‘Kâwlhnâm, ram chu fe thleng rawh’, tia, amaa inthawka ramsa le mi- hriemhai ka sât thlâk chun,"
18,"though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.","hieng mi pathumhai hi a sûnga chun um sienkhawm, Lalpa PATHIEN chun, ‘kei ka hring angin, naupa amanih, naunu amanih sanhim naw ni hai a, anni le anni chau insanhim an tih,’ a tih."
19,"Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;","Annawleh, rama chun hripui ka tir a, a chunga chun, ramsa le mi- hriemhai chu sât thla dinga, thisenin ka lunginsenna ka bunthlâk chun,"
20,"though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.","Noa le Daniel le Job chu a sûnga chun um hai sienkhawm, Lalpa PATHIEN chun, ‘kei ka hring angin, naupa amanih, naunu amanih chu sanhim naw ni hai a, an felnain anni le anni chau chu in sanhim an tih,’ a tih."
21,"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti sih a; ‘Ka rorêlna natak palihai kâwlhnâm, ṭâmna, ramsa tuor- hlaumhai le hripuihai hi Jerusalem chunga, amaa inthawka ramsa mi- hriemhai râwthmang dinga ka tir pha chun ieng ang lâwma nasa zuol am a ni ding chu?"
22,"Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.","Amiruokchu, ngai ta, chutaka chun a mahla lâksuok la ni rawp an ta, an naupasalhai le an naunu- hmeihai chu; ngai ta, in kuoma chun hung suok an ta, an umdân le an thilthawhai chu lo hmûng in tih, chun, Jerusalem chunga thil ṭha naw ka hung intlungtir thua le a chunga ka hung intlungtir po po thua chun sukthlamuongin um in tih."
23,"And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord Jehovah.","An um dânhai le an thilthawhai i hmu pha chun sukthlamuong an ti cheh a, a sûnga ka ithaw tahai po po chu a san um loin ka thaw nawh ti hre tâng in tih,’ Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
