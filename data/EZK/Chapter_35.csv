1,"Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",Chu nawa khawm chun LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:
2,"Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,","“Mihriem naupa, Seir tlâng chu i hmai innghat la, a chunga chun thu hril la,"
3,"and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment.","a kuoma chun hieng hin ti rawh: Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, nang chu ka dodâl cheh a, aw Seir tlâng, i chunga chun ka kut kân let ding a nih; chun, nang chu râu- sana le maktiah ka siem ding che a nih."
4,"I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.","I khawpuihai chu suksietin in- umtir ka ta, nang khawm râusanin um i tih; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng i tih."
5,"Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;","Hun tâwpa hremna huna, an vângsiet lai hunah Israel thlahai chu kâwlhnâm thilthawtheina kuoma i lo pêk a, anni chu hmêlmâkna rê lo i nei leiin;"
6,"therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.","ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: thisen ta dingin buotsai ka ti cheh a, thisen chun hnawt a ti che; thisen chu i theida naw leiin, thisen chun hnawt a ti che."
7,Thus will I make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth.,"Chuongchun, Seir tlâng chu râu- san le maktia um dingin siem ka ta; chun, amaa inthawk chun a fethleng hlaktu le, a kîr hlaktu chu sât thlâng ka tih."
8,And I will fill its mountains with its slain: in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword.,"I tlânghai chu a mi thathai chun suksip ka ta; i muolahai, i phairuom- ahai le i tui luongnahaia chun kâwl- hnâma thata umhai chu tlûng an tih."
9,"I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Kumkhuoa râusanah siem ka ta, i khawpuihai chu hluo ni nâwk ta ngai naw nih; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng i tih."
10,"Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Jehovah was there:","“Nang chun, ‘Hi hnam hnihai le hi ram pahnihai hi ka ta nîng a ta, nei ka tih,’ i ti leiin, chutaka chun LALPA chu a um a,"
11,"therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast showed out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee.","chuleiin, ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; an chunga i lo inentir tah, anni i thîkna ang pei le, i lunginsenna hu ang peiin ka thaw ding a nih; i chungthu ka rêl pha chun, anni laia chun an mi hriet dingin insiem ka tih."
12,"And thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, have heard all thy revilings which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.","Chuongchun, ‘Suksietin an um tah a, ei kuomah fâk zo el dingin pêkin an um ta a ni hi,’ tiha Israel tlânghai chunga thu i lo hril a, anni i lo demnahai po po chu kei LALPA hin ka hriet vawng a nih, ti hre tâng i tih."
13,"And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it.","Chun, i bauin keia chungah nang le nang în chawimawi a, ka chunga i thuhrilhai i sukpung a; ka hriet a nih."
14,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih: Leihnuoi pumpui chu a hlim pha chun, nang chu râusanah siem ka ti che."
15,"As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Râusan a ni leia Israel sûngkuo rochan chunga chun i lo hlim ta ang khan, i chungah chuong ang tak chun ka thaw ding a nih; Aw Seir tlâng, Edom tlâng po po, a rêng elin, râusan nîng in tih; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
