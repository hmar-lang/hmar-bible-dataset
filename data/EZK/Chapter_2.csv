1,"And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.","Chun, ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, i kehai chun ngîr la, in- biekpui ka ti che,” a mi tih a."
2,"And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.","Chun, ka kuoma thu a hril lai chun thlarau chu ka sûnga chun a hung lût a, ka kehai chun a mîn ngîrtir a; chun, ka kuoma thuhriltu chu ka ngai tah a."
3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.","Ka kuoma chun, “Mihriem naupa, Israel thlahai, hnam helhai, keima chunga helhai kuoma chun tir ka ti che; vawisûn ni chen hin, anni le an thlatuhai khawmin ka chungah an bawsiet a nih."
4,"And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chu thla chu zakmawtak le lungril ngar an na; an kuoma chun ka tir che a ni hi; chun, an kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril i tih, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih,’ tiin."
5,"And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.","Chun, an lo ngai khawma, an lo ngaisak naw khawmin amanih, anni laia zâwlnei a um ti chu hre chêk an tih, (sûngkaw hel an ni sih a)."
6,"And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.","Chun, nang mihriem naupa, anni chu ṭi naw la, hlo hlingnei le buorhai i kâwla chun umin, ainuvêt laia chun chêng la khawm, an thuhai chu ṭi chuong bawk naw la; sûngkaw hel hmang ni hai sien khawm an thuhaia chun ṭi naw la, an hmêl enin beidawng bawk naw rawh."
7,"And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.","Chun, an lo ngai khawma, an lo ngaisak naw khawma, an kuoma chun ka thuhai chu hril hrim hrim i ta; hel hmangtak el an ni sih a."
8,"But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.","Nisienlakhawm, nang mihriem naupa, i kuoma ka hril chu ngai ta; chu sûngkuo hel hmang ang chun hel hmang ni ve naw la; i bau chu ka la, ka pêk che chu fa rawh,” a ta."
9,"And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;","Chun, ka hang en a, ngai ta, keia tieng hin bân hin a mi hei ban a; chun, ngai ta, chutaka chun lekhabu zuol hi a um a;"
10,"and he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.","ka hmaa chun a hung phar a, a sûngtieng le a puotienga ziek a na; chutaka chun sûnna le, ṭâna le chungrikna ziek a nih."
