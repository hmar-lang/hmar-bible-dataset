4,"And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Ka mit chun hla naw ni che a, lunginsietna khawm nei naw ning che; nisienlakhawm, i um dânhai leiin hrem ka ti che, i tirdakumna chu nangmaah a um si a; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng i tih."

7,"Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, upon the mountains.","Aw ram hluotu, i chungrikna chu a hung tlung tah; a hun chu a hung tlung a, a ni chu a hnai tah, tlâng chunghaia hlimna khêk rihai ni loin, buoina ni chu."
8,"Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.","Tuhin sâwt nawteah ka lung- insenna chu i chungah hung bun- thlâng ka ta, i chunga ka lunginsenna chu sukpuitling ka tih; i um dânhai ang peiin i chungah ro rêl ka ta, i tirdakumnahai po po leiin hrem ka ti che."
9,"And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.","Ka mit chun hla naw ni, lunginsietna nei bawk naw ning; i um dânhai ang peiin i chungah hung intlungtir ka ta; i tirdakumnahai chu nangmaah a um si a; chun, kei LALPA hin ka hrem che a nih ti hre tâng i tih."

11,"Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.","Thawluinaa inthawkin rîtlona hmawl a hung suok a, a tu el khawm um sawng thei naw nih a, an mipuihai khawm, an hausaknahai khawm; anni lai chun a ṭhabik ti khawm um naw nih."
12,"The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.","A hun chu a hung tlung a, a ni chu a hung hnai tah; inchawtu chu hlim naw sienla, a zawrtu khawma pawiti bawk naw raw se; mi po po chungah lunginsenna chu a um si a."
13,"For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.","An dam zing sûng chun, a zawrtu chu zawra um tah kuoma chun a kîr nâwk âwm si nawh a; hi thilhmulâwk hin mipui po po a huom vawng a; tukhawm kir nâwk naw ni a, tukhawm ama suolnaa chun dam muolsuo naw nih."

19,"They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.","An tangkahai chu kawtthlêr- haia chun dehâwn an ta, an râng- kachakhai khawm chu thil thieng naw ang hung nîng a tih; an tangka le rângkachak chun LALPA lungin- senna nia chun anni chu sansuok naw nih a; an lungril chu suktlaiin, an phîng khawm chu sukkhawp bawk naw ni hai, an suolnaa tlûkna lung a ni tâk leiin."
20,"As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.","An incheina mawina chu inlal- saknân an hmang a; nisienlakhawm, an tirdakumna limhai chu an siemin, an pawrchena thilhai limhai le chun; chuleiin, an ta ding chun thil thieng- nawah ka siem tah a nih."
21,"And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.","Man dingin ramdang mihai kut- ah pêng ka ta, mi rilohai kuomah râllâk dingin; chuongchun, sukpawr- chêng an tih."
22,"My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.","Ka hmai chu an kuoma in- thawkin la hmang ka ta, ka hmun inthieng chu sukpawrchêng an tih; inru hmanghai chu a sûngah lût an ta, sukpawrchêng an tih;"
23,"Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.","Khaidiet chu siem rawh; ram chu thisen insuo thusiein a sip a, khawpui sûng chu inpâwngnêknain a sip sih a."
24,"Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.","Chuleichun, awi naw mi ṭha nawtakhai chu hung ṭhuoi ka ta, an inhai chu neipêk an tih; mi hrâthai chapona chu suktâwp bawk ka ta; chun, an hmun inthienghai chu sukpawrche nîng an tih."
25,"Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.","Bohmangna chu a hung tlung mêk a, inremna chu zawng an tih; anachu um naw ni."
26,"Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.","Sietna chunga siet nâwk zuolna hung tlung a ta, thuthang chunga chun thuthang um a ta; chun, zâwlnei thilhmulâwkhai chu zawng an ta, nisienlakhawm, thiempua inthawkin dân le, mi hluihaia inthawkin thu- râwn chu bohmang tâng a tih."
27,"The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Lal chu lusûnin um a ta, hotu khawm chu beidawngnain inthuom a tih; chun, rama mipuihai kuthai chu sukbuoi nîng a ta; an um dânhai ang peiin an chungah thâwng ka tih; chun, an ngaithana ang peiin rorêl- pêk ka ta; chun, LALPA ka ni ti mi hre tâng an tih,” tiin."
