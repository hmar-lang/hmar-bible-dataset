1,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.","Chun, hmârtieng lampuia, huon sûng tuollai puo lema chun a mi ṭhuoi suok a; hmârtieng panga in zâwna um, hmun daidan epa pindan kêma chun a mi ṭhuoi lût a."
2,"Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.",Hmartieng panga pindan chu a sei tieng tawng za khat a na; a khang tieng chu tawng sâwmnga a nih.
3,"Over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.","Huon sûng tuollai sûngril lema ṭhang tawng sâwmhni zâwna le, huon sûng tuollai puo lem epa lungpha zâwna chun dawdan inep ṭhieuin sâwng thumin a um a."
4,"And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits’ breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.","Chun, pindanhai hmaa chun, sûnglûtin inlawnna tawng sâwma lien, tawng za khata sei a um a; chun, an kawtkhârhai chu hmar sawng an nih."
5,"Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.","Chun, pindan chunghnung lem- hai chu an tawi lem a; dawdanhai chun a hnuoihnung le a laitak nêkin ina chun hmun an aw lien lem sih a."
6,"For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the uppermost was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.","Sâwng thum an ni sih a; huon sûng tuollaia sûtpuihai ang kha sûtpui an nei ve nawh a; chuleiin, a chunghnung tak chu a hnuoia nêkin ân têp a, a hnuoihnung tak nêkin a lailung chu ân têp lem a."
7,"And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.","Pindan kêmhai zâwn pei puoah, tuollai puo lem tiengah pindanhai epa ân huonna chu tawng sâwmngaa sei a nih."
8,"For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits.","Huon sûng tuollai puo lema pin- dan chu a dung tieng tawng sâwmnga an ni sih a; chun, ngai ta, biekin tuola chun tawng za khat a nih."
9,"And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.","Hieng pindanhai hnuoia hin saktieng pangah lûtna a um a, huon sûng tuollai puo lema inthawka lûtna chu."
10,"In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.",Chutaka chun puo tieng bang ân ṭan a. Simtienga khawm huon sûng tuollai le inepa chun pindanhai an um bawk a.
11,"And the way before them was like the appearance of the way of the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.","An hmaa lampui chu hmâr- tienga pindanhai lampui ang bawk kha a na; an seizie le a khang tieng khawm ân ang; a suokna lampuihai le an rem dân dâm, a kawtkhârhai chenin ân ang vawng a nih."
12,"And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.","Simtieng panga pindanhai hnuoia chun saktieng pangah lûtna a um a, chu chu fe thlengna lampui chu a nih. Chuonghai epa chun pindanna bang a um a."
13,"Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Hmârtienga pindanhai le simtienga pindanhai, hmun âwl hmaa umhai hi, pindan inthieng, thiempu LALPA hnaituhaiin thil inthiengtakhai an fâkna ding a nih; chutaka chun thil inthiengtakhai chau chu sieng an tih, bu thilinhlân dâm, suol thilinhlân dâm, bawsietna thilinhlân dâm chu; chu hmun chu ân thieng sih a."
14,"When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.","Thiempuhai chu an lût pha chun, huon sûng tuollai puo lema chun hmun inthienga inthawk chun an fe suok ding a ni nawh a, ami- ruokchu, chutaka chun, an rawng- bâwlnaa chun an silfênhai sieng an ta; an inthieng sih a; silfên dangin inbel an ta, chun, mipui tieng chu an hung hnai chau ding a nih,” a ta."
15,"Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.","Chun, in sûngril lem chu inkhi zo hnung chun, dâi kawtkhâr, sak- tieng nghaa chun a mi ṭhuoi suok a, chun, a vêl chun ân khi tah a."
16,"He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.","Inkhina luonghmawl chun sak- tieng chu ân khi a, inkhina luong- hmawl chun a vêlin tawng za nga a nih."
17,He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.,"Chun, hmârtienga khawm chun a vêlin, inkhina luonghmawl chun tawng za ngain ân khi bawk a."
18,He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.,"Inkhina luonghmawl chun, sim- tieng pang khawm chu tawng za ngain ân khi a."
19,"He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.","Chun, thlang tieng chu ân khi nâwk a, inkhina luonghmawl chun tawng za ngain ân khi a."
20,"He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.","A sîr lia chun ân khi tah a, a sei tieng chu za nga, a khang tieng khawm za nga bawk, a vêlin bang a nei a, hmun narân le hmun inthieng chu ṭhena dingin."
