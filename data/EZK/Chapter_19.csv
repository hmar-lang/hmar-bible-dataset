1,"Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,","Chu nawa chun Israel lalhai ta ding chun sûnna hla phuok la,"
2,"and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps.","I nu chu ieng am a na? Sakeibakneipui a nih, A bawk a, a têhai châwmin, sakeibaknei tuoihai laia chun."
3,"And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.","A têhai pakhat chu a hung châwm tlei a, Sakeibaknei tuoi a hung na, fâkding man ân chûk a; Mihriemhai chu a fâk zo tah a."
4,The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.,"Hnamhai khawm chun a chanchin an lo hriet a, An khura chun lâkin a um a; Khaidieta khitin Aigupta rama chun an hung ṭhuoi tah a."
5,"Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.","A nu chu a nghâk zing a, a beiseina a bo tah ti a hriet a, A te dang a lâk vak a, sakeibaknei tuoiah a siem nâwk a."
6,"And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.","Sakeibakneihai lai a suk a tungin ân lawn a, Sakeibakneituoi a hung na, fâkding man an chûk a; Mihriemhai chu a fâk zo tah a."
7,"And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring.","An in ropuihai chu a hriet a, an khawpuihai a suksiet a, Ân rûm ri leiin ram chu râusanin a um a, a bitna lai po po le chun."
8,Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.,"Rambunghaia inthawk sîr tinah hnamhaiin ama an hung kal a, A chungah an lênhai an keiphar a, an khura chun a tla tah a."
9,"And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.","Kawl inbunin bâwmah an khum a, Babulon lal kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; Kul dettak sûngah an ṭhuoi a, A râwlhai chu Israel tlânghaia inthawk hriet a ni nâwk ta nawna dingin."
10,"Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.","I nu chu i thisena chun tuihai kâwla phun, grêphrui, Tuihai tam leia ra nuomtak le kâua sip ang a nih."
11,"And it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.","A kâu ngartakhai chu rorêltu lalhmawla hmang an hung nih a, A buk samup laia khawm chun an dâwk lûr bik a; Kâu tamtakhai laiah ân sâng leiin an hmu bîk lûr bawk a."
12,"But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.","Nisienlakhawm, lunginsenna hmalthlakin a um a, Hnuoia pei thlâkin a um a, Sak thliin a sukṭâwl a, a ra a mût ṭil a, A kâu ngartak khawm chu suktliek a hung na, A vuoi tah a, meiin a kâng hmang tah a."
13,"And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.","Tuhin chu thlalêrah, Ram ṭâwl le tuihulnaah phunsawn a ni tah."
14,"And fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it hath devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.","A kâu kuonghaia inthawk mei a suok a, a ra a kâng hmang zo a, Chuleiin, kâu ngartak rorêlnaa lalhmawla hmang thei khawm a um ta nawh. Hi hi sûnna chu a na, sûnna hla chu la hung nîng a tih."
