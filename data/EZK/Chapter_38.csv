7,"Be thou prepared, yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.","Inbuotsai la, anih, nangma chu inbuotsai la, pâwlhai nanga kuoma hung inkhawmhai po po chunga chun nang chu a vêngtu ni la."
8,"After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.","Ni tamtak hnunga chun ko khâwm ning i ta, kum nuhnungahai chun indonaa inthawka sansuok, hnam tamtakhaia inthawka lâk khâwmhai umna ram, Israel tlâng- hai, râusana um zing zing el chu hung tlung i tih; anni chu hnamhai laia inthawka lâk suok an na, an rêng chun himtakin an chêng ding a nih."

10,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt devise an evil device:","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti a nih: Chu ni chun chuong chu hung tlung a ta, thilhai chu i lungrila chun hung lût a ta, ngairuotna rilo ngairuot i ta,"
11,"and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;","khuohai kul neiloa an umna rama chun hang fêng ka ta, to ṭawk ṭawka chênghai, himtaka chênghai kuoma chun; an rêngin kul neiloin an chêng a, dai kawtkhârhai le kalna thîrtluonhai boin;"
12,"to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth.","Râllâk sumhai la ding le, râlhai man ding le, tuta hluoa um tah hmun se tahai le, hnamhaia inthawka mi- pui lâk suokhai, hnuoi lailia chênga ran ruolhai le thuomhnawhai neia khawsahai chunga chun kut inlet dingin fêng ka tih, tîng i ta."
13,"Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?","Seba le Dedan le, Tarsis sum- dâwng mihai le, chutaka sakeibaknei tuoihai chun i kuomah, ‘Râllâk sum- hai chu la dinga hung am i nih?

15,"And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army;","Hmârtieng kil khâwra hmun- haia inthawk chun hung i ta, nang le i kuoma mi tamtak leh, anni chu an rêngin sakawr chunga chuong, pâwl ropuitak, sipai pâwl thilthawtheitak nîng an ta;"
16,"and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.","ka mi Israelhai chu hung do i ta, sûmpuiin ram a hung tuom ding ang elin; chun, ni nuhnungahai chun aw Gog, an mithmu ngeia nang- maa sukthienga ka um phaa hnam tamtakhai chun an mi hriet theina dingin, ka ram chu indodâl tir ka ti che."

18,"And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.","“Gog chun Israel ram chu a hung do pha, chu nia chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; Ka ṭiumna chu ka hnârkuoa inthawkin khu suok a tih."
19,"For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;","Ka îtthîkna le ka lunginsen lai chun ka hril ta sih a: Matheiloin, chu ni chun Israel rama chun inhnîngna nasatak um a ta,"
20,"so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.","chuongchun, tuisuorieta ngahai dâm, chunglêng vatehai dâm, rama ramsahai dâm, hnuoi chunga bawk- vâka invâk thilhringhai po po dâm, hnuoi phêk chunga mihriem umhai po po dâm, ka hmaihmaa chun inthin an ta, tlânghai chu pei thlûkin um an ta, hmun inṭênhai chu tlathlâng an ta, kulbang tinhai chu hnuoiah tlâng an tih."
21,"And I will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah: every man’s sword shall be against his brother.","Ka tlânghai po po kuoma chun, ama do dingin kâwlhnâm ko ka ta, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; mi tin kâwlhnâm chu a unau chungah um a tih."
22,"And with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.","Ama chu thisen le hripuiin do ka ta; chun, ama le a pâwlhai le ama kuoma mipui tamtak umhai chunga chun ruopui vânâwnin, ṭêk le mei le meitâwklungin sûr ka ta."
23,"And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.","Chun, kei le kei inchawimawiin, insukthieng ka ta, hnam tamtakhai mithmua chun kei chu insukhmêl- hriet ka ta; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
