1,"The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung nâwk a,"
2,"What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?","“Hi thuvar Israel rama in hmang, ‘Pahai chun grêp thûr an fâk tah a, nauhai hahai chu a ṭim,’ ti hi ieng tinâm a na?"
3,"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.","Ka hring zing angin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; Israel rama chun hi thuvar hi hmangna ding hun hrim nei ta naw ti niu."
4,"Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.","Ngai ta, thlarau po po chu ka ta an na, pa hringna chu ka ta a ni ang bawkin, naupa hringna khawm chu ka ta a nih; thlarau thil suksuol chu thîng a tih."
5,"But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,","Amiruokchu, mi chu a fel a, ân dik le dân anga a thawh a,"
6,"and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor’s wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity,","tlânghai chunga chun a fâk bawk nawh a, Israel sûngkuohai milimhai tieng chun a mithai ân lên bawk nawh a, a tuolbâwm nuhmei chu a lo sukpawrche nawh a, nuhmei insiehran lai a hung hnai bawk nawh a;"
7,"and hath not wronged any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;","tukhawm ân suksuoltir nawh a, battu kuoma chun a hnina chu ân hmutir a, thawluinain tukhawm a suksiet nawh a, mi phîngṭâmhai chu bei a lo pêk tah a, saruokhai chu silfên a lo inkhum tah a;"
8,"he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man,","a pung hnawt dinga pe suok ngai lo a, a pung khawm la ngai lo a, suolnaa inthawka a kut keitîm a, mi le mi inkâra rorêlna indiktak lo hmang hlak a,"
9,"hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept mine ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah.","indiktaka thaw dinga ka rorêlhai zâwm a, ka thuruothai a pawm chun, ama chu mi indik a na, hring ngei ngei a tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
10,"If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth any one of these things,","Amiruokchu, naupasal a nei a, inru a nih a, thisen insuotu, hieng thilhai a ieng amani hi thawh a,"
11,"and that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor’s wife,","hieng thil thaw dinghai hi thaw lo a, amiruokchu, tlâng chunga lo fa tah a, a tuolbâwmhai nuhmei lo suk- pawrche tah a,"
12,"hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,","mi tlasam le mi rimsihai lo insuksuoltir tah a, thawluinaa lo sukse tah a, hnina lo ngaisak lo a, milimhai tienga a mithai lo inlên tah a, tirdakumnahai lo thaw tah a,"
13,"hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.","a pung um dinga lo pe suok tah a, a pung khawm lo la ta hlak chu, ama chu a hring ding am a nih? Ama chu hring naw nih a, hieng tirdak- umnahai po po thawtu hi chu thi ngei ngei a ta, a thisen chu ama chunga chun a um ding a nih."
14,"Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins, which he hath done, and feareth, and doeth not such like;","Chun, ngai ta, ama chun naupasal hung nei ve sien, a pain suolna a thawhai po po chu lo hmu tah a, ama chun ṭih a, chuonga thaw ve lo a,"
15,"that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbor’s wife,","tlânghai chunga khawm lo la fa lo a, Israel sûngkaw milimhai tienga a mithai khawm lân lên ngai lo a, a tuolbâwm nuhmei khawm lo la sukpawrche lo a,"
16,"neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;","mi tu chunga khawm lo suksuol ngai lo a, hninaa thutiem la ngai lo a, thawluinaa la sukse ngai lo a, ami- ruokchu, a bei chu tlasamhai kuoma peh a, saruok chu silfêna lo inkhum tah a,"
17,"that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed mine ordinances, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.","mi rimsihaia inthawka kut lo keitîm tah a, a pung hnawta lo inpûktir lo a, a pung khawm la lo a, ka rorêlnahai lo thaw tah a, ka thuruothai lo zâwm tah; chuong ang mi chu a pa suolna lei chun thi naw nih a, hring ngei ngei a tih."
18,"As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.","A pa chungthua chun, ama chun rilotakin a lo nêksâwr tah a, thaw- luinain a unau chu a lo suksiet tah a, a mihai laia thil ṭha naw chu a lo thaw leiin ngai ta, a suolnaa chun thi ngei a tih."
19,"Yet say ye, Wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.","Amiruokchu, nang chun, ieng- dinga naupa chun pa suolna chu a phur nâwm a na? i ti a ni thei a. Naupa chun dân ang le thil indik chu a thaw pha chun, ka thuruothai chu a pawm bawk a, a thaw bawk chun, hring ngei a tih."
20,"The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.","Mi a suksuoltu chu, chu chu thîng a ta; naupa chun pa suolna chu phur naw nih a, pa khawma naupa suolna chu phur bawk naw ni; mi fel felna chu mi fel chunga chun um a ta, mi rilo rîtlona chu mi rilo chunga bawk chun um a tih."
21,"But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.","“Amiruokchu, mi rilo chu a thil suksuolhaia inthawk chun ân her hmang a, ka thuruothai chu a zâwm a, ân dik le dân ang thilhai chu a thaw chun, hring ngei a ta, thi naw nih."
22,None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.,"A bawsietnahai po po a ieng khawm chu ama chunga chun hriet zing ni ta naw nih a, chun, a felna a ithaw ngeia chun ama chu hring a tih."
23,"Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Jehovah; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?",Mi rilo thina chunga hin inhawi tina hrim ka nei am a nih? Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih; a lampuia inthawk chun hung kîr lemin a hring ding a ni naw am a nih?
24,"But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.","Nisienlakhawm, mi fel chu a felnaa inthawka ân her hmang a, suolna a thaw chun, mi riloin a thaw hlak anga tirdakumnahai po po kha a thaw ve chun, a hring ding am a nih? A thilthaw felhai, a lo thaw tahai a ieng ieng khawm kha hriet zing ni ta naw nih a, a bawsietnaa a bawsietna le, a suolnaa a suksuolna chun, chuongahai chun a thi ngei ding a nih."
25,"Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?","Amiruokchu, Lalpa lampui chu ân ang rawp nawh a, in la ti a ni thei a; tuhin ngai la, Aw Israel sûngkuo, ka lampui chu ân ang vawng an nâwm a nih? In lampuihai ni lo am a ni ân ang vawng naw chu?"
26,"When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth therein; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.","Mi fel chu a felnaa inthawka ân her hmang a, thil suol a thaw chun thîng a ta, suolna a ithawa chun thîng a tih."
27,"Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.","Chu nawah, mi rilo chu a rîtlonaa rîtlona a lo thaw tahaia in thawka ân her hmang a, chun, ân dik le dân ang thilhai chu a thaw chun, a thlarau chu hringin sanhim a tih."
28,"Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.","Ama chun a ngaituoh a, a lo thaw tah, a bawsietnahai po poa inthawk chun ân her hmang tâk leiin thi naw nih a, hring ngei ngei a tih."
29,"Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?","Israel sûngkuo chun, Lalpa lampui chu ân ang vawng lêm, an la ti rawp khawm a ni theia, Aw Israel sûngkuo, ka lampuihai chu ân ang vawng a ni naw maw? Nanga lam- puihai lem an nâwm a nih ân ang naw chu?"
30,"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.","Chuleiin, Israel sûngkuo, mi tin chu a thilthawhai ang peiin rêlpêk ka tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih. Hung kîr unla, in bawsietnahai po poa inthawkin hung kîr ro; chuongchun, suolna chu in tlûkna lung hung ni naw nih."
31,"Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?","In bawsietnahai po po, in lo bawsiet tahai chu, nangnia inthawk- in peihâwn unla, thlarau thar le lung- ril thar insiempêk unla, aw Israel sûngkuo, iengdingin am thîng in ta?"
32,"For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah: wherefore turn yourselves, and live.","Mi thinaa chun lâwmna ka nei si nawh a, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih, chuleiin, hung kîr unla, hring ro,” tiin."
