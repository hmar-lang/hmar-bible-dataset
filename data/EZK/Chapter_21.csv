1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a,"
2,"Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;","“Mihriem naupa, i hmai chu Jerusalem tieng innghat la, i thu chu hmun inthieng tieng inthla la, Israel ram chunga chun thu hril rawh;"
3,"and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.","chun, Israel ram kuoma chun hieng hin hril la, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, nang hi ka dodâl cheh a, a bâwma inthawk chun ka kâwlhnâm chu phawi dawk ka ta, nangmaa inthawka mi fel le mi rilohai khawm chu sât thlâng ka tih."
4,"Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:","Nangmaa inthawka mi fel le mi rilohai chu ka sât thlâk ding a nih ti hmuin, simtienga inthawka hmâr- tieng chenin, ka kâwlhnâm chu tisa po po chu doin a bâwma inthawk chun phawi suok nîng a ta;"
5,"and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.","chun, tisa tin chun kei LALPA ngeiin ka kâwlhnâm chu a bâwma inthawkin ka phawi a nih ti hrieng an ta; thun nâwk ni ta ngai naw nih."
6,"Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes.","Chuleiin, inthuok huoi la, nang mihriem naupa, i kâwng chu namin rinumtitakin an mithmua chun inrûm rawh."
7,"And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, i kuomah, ‘Ieng am i thuokindawng pui leh?’ an ti pha chun, ‘Chanchinhai leiin, a hung tlung mêk sih a,’ tîng i ta; chun, lungril tin chu intui a ta, kut po pohai chu hung châu an ta, thlarau tin chu hung châuhâwp an ta, khûphai po po khawm chu tui angin hung zawi an tih; ngai ta, a hung mêk a, thaw khawm a ni ngei ding a nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih, tîng i tih,” a ta."
8,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuom- ah a hung tlung a,"
9,"Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;","“Mihriem naupa, thu hril la, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih ti rawh: Kâwlhnâm, kâwlhnâm tâtngeiin a um a, Nâwttlêt a ni bawk a."
10,"it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.","A that a that theina dinga tâtngei a na, Kâwlinlep ang a ni theina dingin nâwttlêt a ni bawk a! Hlimna ei la siem rawp ding am a nih? Ka naupa hmawl chun thing tinhai chu a hung hmusit a."
11,"And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.","Chun, hmang a ni theina dingin nâwttlêt dinga pêk a na; Kâwlhnâm chu, tâtngei a na, Anih, thattu kuta pêk dingin nâwttlêtin a um a nih."
12,"Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh.","Mihriem naupa, khêk la, inrûm rawh; ka mihai chunga tlung a na, Israel lalhai po po chungah a tlung sih a; anni chu ka mihai leh kâwlhnâm kuoma chun pêkin an um a; Chuleiin, i êlpui chu ben rawh."
13,For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.,"Fiena a um sih a; iengtin am ni tâng a ta, Hmawl a hmusittu khawm a um ta naw ding si chun? Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,"
14,"Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which entereth into their chambers.","“Chuleiin, nang mihriem nau- pa, thu hril la, i kuthai chu ben la, a ṭum thumnaa chun kawlhnâm chu nawn ni sienla, thina khawp hliemna kâwlhnâm chu; thi khawp raua hliem mi pakhat ropuitak kâwlhnâm a nih; an pindanhaia lût chu."
15,"I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.","An dâi kawtkhârhai po po zâwna chun kâwlhnâm inzum chu kân nghat a, an lungrilhai chu a hung intui theina ding le, mi tamtak an tlûk theina dingin. E, kâwlinlep anga siem a ni chu aw! dettaka chel a ni tah a."
16,"Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is set.","Inkeikhâwm la, changtieng fe la, vân tlar la, vawi tieng fe la, chu tieng chun i hmai chu innghat la."
17,"I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.","Kei khawma ka kuthai ben tuong ka ta, lunginsenna chu sukdei ka tih; kei LALPA chun ka ti ta a nih, ti rawh,” a ta."
18,"The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,","LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a,"
19,"Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.","“Nang mihriem naupa, Babulon lal kâwlhnâm chu a hung theina dingin lampui pahni ruot bawk rawh; An pahni chun ram pakhata in- thawkin hung suok an ta; hmun pa- khat inchik an ta, khawpui lûtna lam tluongpui laia chun inchik an tih."
20,"Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.",Ammon thlahai Rabba kuoma le inhumhimna Juda rama Jerusalema kâwlhnâm hungna dingin lampui ruot la;
21,"For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.","Babulon lal chu lampui inṭhena lai, lampui pahnihai inchinna taka chun, dawi hmang dingin a ngîr zing sih a; hnungtieng hmatieng thalhai chu a hêm vêl a, milimhai chu a râwn a, sathin chu a en bawk a."
22,"In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.","A changtieng kuta chun Jerusa- lem ta dinga, kâphmunhai siemna ding le, thattuhai ta ding bau kâk ding le, khêka râwl insuo ding le, dâi kawtkhârhai epa kâphmunhai siem ding le, hnuoi dêng pâwnghai siem a, kulhai bâwl ding thu aisânna chu a um a."
23,"And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.","An kuoma ṭawngsiehaia lo inkhâm ta khawm chu an mithmu chun an ta dingin aisânna teplo nîng a tih; amiruokchu, chu chun suolna chu hriet zing dingah a hung lâk a, anni chu lâk an ni theina dingin."
24,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.","Chuleiin, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih: in bâwsietnahai chu hmusuokin a um a, insuolnahai chu hriet zing dingin in siem ta leiin, thil in thaw taphawthaia chun in suolnahai chu hung inlang vêng an tih, hriet zingna dinga chun i hung um ta leiin, kuta lâk nîng i tih."
25,"And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,","Chun, nang aw thi khawp raua hliem mi rilo, Israel lal, ama ni chu a hung tlung mêk a, a tâwpnaa hremna huna hin;"
26,"thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this shall be no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Lallukhum chu sawn la, lallukhum chu la hmang rawh; hi hi a pângngai zing ni ta naw ni; ân hnuoi chu chawimawi la, ân sâng chu sukhnuoi rawh."
27,"I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.","Inletling ka ta, letling ka ta, letling ka ta, hi khawm hi um ta naw nih a, a thuneitu a hung hmakhat chun; chun, ama kuoma chun pêng ka tih."
28,"And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;","“Chun, nang mihriem naupa, thu hril la, Ammon thlahai le anni vaulâwkna, chungthua chun Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih, ti rawh: Kâwlhnâm, kâwlhnâm chu thatna dingin phawi a nih a, kâwlin- lep ang ela tle zawr zawr dinga nâwt tlêt a nih."
29,"while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.","an hremna nuhnungtak ding hun, mi rilo tâwpkhâwkhai ringa in- nghat ding ni tlung mêk zing laiin thilhmulâwk teplo hmupêk chein aisânna khêlhlip an hrilpêk che a nih."
30,"Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth, will I judge thee.","A bâwma chun thun kîr nâwk el rawh. Siema i umna hmunah, i pien ipatna ram ngeia chun i chungah ro rêl ka tih."
31,"And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.","I chunga chun ka lunginsenna chu hung bunthlâng ka ta, ka lunginsenna mei chu i chunga chun hung mût ka tih; chun, mi hrânghai, that dân thiemtakhai kuta chun pesuok ka ti che."
32,"Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I, Jehovah, have spoken it.","Nang chu meia thingthu ding chau ni tâng i ta; i thisen chu rama chun um a ta; nang chu hriet zing ni ta bawk naw ti ni, kei LALPA hin ka hril ta sih a,” tiin."
