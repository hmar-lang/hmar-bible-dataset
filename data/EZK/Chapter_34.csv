1,"And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung a:"
2,"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the sheep?","“Mihriem naupa, Israel berâm- puhai chungah thu hril la, thu hril la, berâmpuhai kuom ngeia chun, an kuoma chun hril rawh; Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih; Israel berâmpuhai mâni le mâni inchâwm- tuhai chu an chung a rik de; berâm- puhai chun berâmhai chu an châwm ding a ni naw am a nih?"
3,"Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill the fatlings; but ye feed not the sheep.","Thâu chu in fâk a, sahmulin in inthuom a; châwm thâuhai chu in that a; nisienlakhawm, berâmhai chu in châwm nawh a."
4,"The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought back that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor have ye ruled over them.","A hrât naw chu in sukhrât nawh a, a na khawm chu in sukdam bawk nawh a; a tliek khawm chu in tuom nawh a, khal hmanga um ta khawm chu in hung ṭhuoi nâwk bawk nawh, ân hmang khawm chu in zawng bawk nawh; amiruokchu, thawluina le, hrohrângsetakin an chungah ro in rêl a."
5,"And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.","Anni chu berâmpu an um naw leiin an indar a; rama sahai po po ta ding chun bu an na, sukdarin an um tah a."
6,"My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and there was none that did search or seek after them.","Ka berâmhai chu tlâng po po le muol insâng tinahai chun an invâk a; anih, ka berâmhai chu leihnuoi pum- pui chunga chun an indar tah a ni hi; mi tukhawm anni chu zawnga hmu- suok tum an um si nawh."
7,"Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:","Chuleiin, nangni berâmpuhai, LALPA thu chu ngai ta u;"
8,"As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my sheep;","Lalpa PATHIEN chun, Ka hring zing angin ka berâmhai chu, berâm- puhai an um nawh a, ka berâmpuhai chun ka berâmhai chu an zawng bawk nawh a, berâmpuhai chu anni le anni an inchâwm a, ka berâmhai chu an châwm naw leiin, rama ram- sahai po po bu le an sasehai chu an lo ni ngei chu a ni ta hi;"
9,"therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:","chuleiin, nangni berâmpuhai, LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u;"
10,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, berâmpuhai chu ka dodâl a nih; ka berâmhai chu an kutah lâkpêk ka ta, an berâm châwm chu inmâktir ka tih; anni berâm- puhai khawm chu mâni le mâni inchâwm bîk ta naw bawk an tih; chun, an ta dinga bu an ni nawna dingin ka berâmhai chu an baua inthawk chun la suok ka tih."
11,"For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.","“Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a ti sih a; Ngai ta, keima ngeiin, keiin ka berâmhai chu zawng ka ta, zawng suok bawk ka tih."
12,"As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.","Berâmpu chun sûnah a berâm ruol chu a zawng a, berâm a lo indarhai laia chun a um hlak angin, ka berâmhai chu zawng suok ka ta; inthim le sûmzîng nia an lo invâk darna hmunhai po poa inthawk chun anni chu zawng suok ka tih."
13,"And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.","Hnamhai laia inthawk chun hung ṭhuoi suok ka ta, rambunghaia inthawk chun kei khâwm ka ta, anni ram ngeia chun ṭhuoi lût ka tih; chun, Israel tlâng chungahai le, tui luongna sîrahai le, chu ram, hluoa a umna hmun po poahai chun anni chu intlattir ka tih."
14,I will feed them with good pasture; and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.,"Hlo pet ding ṭhatak chun anni chu châwm ka ta, Israel insângna tlâng chungahai chun an in chu um a tih; in ṭhatak sûnga chun bawk an ta, Israel tlâng chungahai chun hlo petna hmun tuihnâitaka chun tlâng an tih."
15,"I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun, Ka be- râmhai chu keima ngeiin châwm ka ta, anni chu inbawktir ka tih, a tih."
16,"I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice.","A lo inhmang ta chu zawng ka ta, hnawt hmanga lo um ta khawm chu hung ṭhuoikîr nâwk ka tih; sukthlieka um ta chu tuom ka ta, damnawa um khawm chu sukhrât bawk ka tih; a thâu le a hrât chu suksieng ka ta; anni chu rorêlnain châwm ka tih."
17,"And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats.","Chun, nangni thua chu, Aw ka berâm ruol, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta, kêlchalhai le berâmchalhai ang bawkin, ran ruol le ran ruol chunga chun ro ka rêl a."
18,"Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?","Hlo pet ding ṭha hmuna tlat chu in ta ding chun thil chînthamah ân lang thei a, nisienlakhawm, in hlo pet mahlahai chu in kehaiin in sirde naw ding am a nih? Tui inthiengtakhai hang dâwn ding khawm chun a mahla chu in kehai chun in pal siet naw ding am a nih?"
19,"And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.","Chun, ka berâm ruolhai chun, in kehaia in sir chen ta hnunghai chu an fâk a, in kehaiin a lo pal siet tahai chu an dâwn bawk a ni hi."
20,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.","“Chuleichun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun an kuomah hieng hin a hril a: Ngai ta u, Keiin, kei ngeiin, ran ruol thâu le ran ruol chêr inkâra chun ro rêl ka ta."
21,"Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;","Liengko le sîrin in hneng a, in sukdar phier hmakhat chun in kihai chun a damnawhai chu in sik leiin,"
22,"therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.","ka berâm ruol chu ka sandam ding a nih, anni chu fâk zoin um nâwk ta naw ni hai a; ran ruol le ran ruol inkâr thu chu ka rêl ding a nih."
23,"And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.","An chunga chun berâmpu pakhat sieng ka ta, ka siehlaw David ngei chu, ama chun anni chu châwm a ta, an ta dingin berâmpu nîng a tih."
24,"And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them; I, Jehovah, have spoken it.","Chun, kei LALPA hi in Pathien nîng ka ta, ka siehlaw David chu anni laia lal nîng a tih; hi hi kei LALPAIN ka hril ta a nih."
25,"And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.","Anni le inremna thuthlung siem ka ta, rama inthawk chun ramsa rilohai chu inrêmtir vawng ka tih; thlalêra chun himtakin chêng an ta, rampui hnuoia chun zâl an tih."
26,And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.,"Chun, ka tlâng sîra hmunhai le anni chu malsâwmah siem ka ta; ruo- hai khawm a huntakah hung insûrtir ka ta; malsâwmna ruopui sûrhai hung um a tih."
27,"And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those that made bondmen of them.","Loa thinghai chun ra hung in- suong an ta, leihnuoi khawma a hlâwkna hung insuo bawk a tih; chun, an ram sûnga chun him an ta, an rîngkawl thîrtluonhai ka suktliek a, an rawng an bâwlpêkhai kuta in- thawka ka sansuok pha chun LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng an tih."
28,"And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.","Chun, khawhri be mihai ifâk zoin um ta ngai naw ni hai a, hnuoia ramsahai khawma anni chu fa zo bawk naw ni hai; amiruokchu, him- takin chêng an ta, tukhawma anni chu sukṭi ta naw ni hai."
29,"And I will raise up unto them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more.","Anni lai chun hming inthang khawp thilphun inmâwngtir ka ta, chu rama chun ṭâm ifâk zoin um ta naw ni hai a, hnam danghai biekrâwpna chu tuor ta bawk naw nihai."
30,"And they shall know that I, Jehovah, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, kei LALPA an Pathien chu an kuomah ka um a, anni, Israel sûngkuo chu, ka mihai an nih ti hre tâng an tih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih."
31,"And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord Jehovah.","Chun, nangni ka berâmhai, ka hlo petna hmuna berâmhai chu mihriemhai hi in na; chun, kei in Pathien chu ka nih, Lalpa PATHIEN chun a tih,” tiin."
