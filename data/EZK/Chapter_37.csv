1,"The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.","LALPA kut chu ka chungah a um a, LALPA thlarau chun a mi ṭhuoi suok a, phairuoma hin a mi sie tah a; rua sip a na;"
2,"And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.","chun, anni lai chun a mi ṭhuoi vêl a; ngai ta, phairuom âwla chun a tama tam hi an um a; ngai ta, an ṭâwl tâwl khawp el a."
3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Mihriem naupa, hieng ruhai hi hring thei an ti?” a ta. Chun, “Aw Lalpa PATHIEN, nangin i hriet,” tiin, ka dawn a."
4,"Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Hieng ruhai chunga hin thu hril la, an kuoma chun, ‘Aw nangni ru ṭâwlhai, LALPA thu chu lo ngai ta u,’ ti rawh."
5,"Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.","Hieng ruhai kuoma hin Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, nangniah thuok inlûttir ka ta, hung hring in tih."
6,"And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.","Nangnia chun thahai sieng ka ta, taksain in chungah hung sukbit ka tih, chun, vunin inkhum ka ti cheu, nangnia chun thuok sieng ka ta hung hring in tih; chun, LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih,” a ta."
7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.","Chuongchun, thu pêk ka ni ang chun thu chu ka hril tah a; chuonga thu ka hang hril chun ri a hung um a, ngai ta, simkhawlei a hung inhnîng a, ruhai chu mâni zawmpui sengah an hung fe khâwm tah a."
8,"And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.","Chun, ka hei en a, ngai ta, an chungahai chun thahruihai chu a um a, taksa chu a hung insukbit a, a chunga chun vun chun ân khum tah a; nisienlakhawm, anniahai chun thuok chu a la um nawh a."
9,"Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Thli kuomah thu hril la, thu hril la, mihriem naupa, thli kuoma chun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: ‘Aw thli, hnuoi kil lia inthawk chun hung la, hieng thata umhai chunga hin hung inthli rawh, an hring theina dingin,’ tiin,” a ta."
10,"So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.","Chuongchun, thu a mi pêk ang chun thu chu ka hril tah a, chun, thli chu annia chun a hung lût a, an hring tah a, an kein, sipai pâwl nasa êm êm el angin an hung ngîr suok tah a."
11,"Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.","Chun, ka kuoma chun, “Mi- hriem naupa, hieng ruhai hi Israel sûngkuohai po po chu an na, ngai ta, anni chun, ‘Ei ruhai hlak a ṭâwl zo tah a, ei beisei hlak a bo dêr tah a; sât thlâk fiṭhuoi ei ni ta a ni hi,’ an tih a."
12,"Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.","Chuleiin, thu hril la, an kuomah hieng hin ti rawh: Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, in thlânhai chu hung hawng ka ta, in thlânhaia inthawk chun hung in- suoktir ka ti cheu, aw ka mihai; chun, Israel rama chun ṭhuoi ka ti cheu."
13,"And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.","Chun, aw ka mihai, in thlânhai chu ka hung hawng a, in thlânhaia inthawka kân suoktir pha cheu chun LALPA chu ka nih ti mi hre tâng in tih."
14,"And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah.","Nangnia chun ka thlarau chu sieng ka ta, hring in tih; chun, nangni ram ngeia chun sieng ka ti cheu a; kei LALPA ngeiin ka lo hril tah a, thaw khawm ka thaw a nih, ti hre tâng in tih, LALPA chun a tih, tiin,” a ta."
15,"The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,","Chun, LALPA thu chu ka kuomah a hung tlung nâwk a:"
16,"And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:","“Mihriem naupa, nangin hmawl pakhat la la, a chunga chun ziek la, ‘Juda ta ding le, Israel thlahai a pâwlhai ta ding,’ tiin. Chun, hmawl dang la nâwk la, a chunga chun ziek la, ‘Josef Ephraim hmawl ding le, a pâwlhai Israel sûngkuo ta dingin,’ tiin."
17,"and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.","Chun, nanga ta dingin hmawl pakhata chun zawm la, hmawl pakhat angin, i kuta chun pakhat an ni theina dingin."
18,"And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?","Chun, i chipuihai thlahai chun i kuomah, ‘Hi ieng i tina am a na, i mîn entir naw ding maw?’ an ti pha chun,"
19,"say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.","an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, Ephraim le, a pâwlhai Israel hnamhai kuta um Josef hmawl chu lâng ka ta, Juda hmawl le ngei chun anni chu sie kawp ka ta, hmawl pakhatah siem ka ta, ka kuta chun pakhat nîng an tih’, a tih, ti rawh."
20,And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.,"Chun, hmawl a chunga i ziekhai chu an mithmua ngei chun i kutah an um ding a nih."
21,"And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:","Chun, an kuoma chun, ‘Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng hin a tih: Ngai ta u, hnamhai an lo fe hmang ta nahai laia inthawkin Israel thlahai chu lâng ka ta, kil tina inthawkin ṭhuoi khâwm ka ta, anni ram ngeia chun hung ṭhuoi ka ta;"
22,"and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;","chu rama chun Israel tlânghai chunga chun anni chu hnam khatah siem ka tih; chun, lal pakhat an rênga lal nîng a ta; hnam hni ni ta naw ni hai a, lalram pahnia khawm inṭhe bawk ta naw ni hai;"
23,"neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.","Anni chu an milimhai chun insukpawrche ta ngai naw ni hai a, an thil pawrchehai hrim hrim khawm chun, an bawsietnahai chun insuk- pawrche ta bawk naw ni hai; an umna hmun po po, an hnungtawlna, an lo suol tâkna hmunhaia chun anni chu sandam ka ta, sukthieng bawk ka tih; chuongchun, ka mihai nîng an ta, kei khawm an Pathien nîng ka tih."
24,"And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.","Chun, ka siehlaw David chu an chunga lal nîng a ta, chuongchun, berampu pakhat nei an ta, ka rorêl- hai khawm chu hrâwng an ta, ka thuruothai chu pawmin thaw bawk an tih."
25,"And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.","Ka siehlaw Jakob kuoma ram ka pêk, in thlatuhai chêngnaa khan chêng an ta; chutaka chun kumkhuoa dingin chêng an ta, anni le an nauhai leh, an nauhai nauhai leh; chun, ka siehlaw David chu kumkhuoa dingin an lal nîng a tih."
26,"Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.","Chu nawa khawm chun anni le chun inremna thuthlung siem ka ta, anni le chatuona thuthlung nîng a tih; chun, anni chu sieng ka ta, suk- pung ka ta, anni laia chun ka hmun inthieng chu kumkhawtluongin sie tâng ka tih."
27,"My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.","Ka biekbûk khawm chu anni lai chun um a ta, an Pathien nîng ka ta, anni chu ka mihai nîng an tih."
28,"And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.","Chun, kumkhawtluonga, anni laia ka hmun inthieng chu a um pha chun hnamhai chun kei LALPA hin Israel chu ka sukthieng a nih ti mi hre tâng an tih,’ ti rawh,” tiin."
