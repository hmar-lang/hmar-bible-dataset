1,"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.","Kum sâwmthumna kum, a thla linaa, ni nga ni chun, Kebar vadung panga salhai laia ka um lai chun, vânhai a hung inhawng a, chun, Pathiena thil hmulâwkhai chu ka hmu tah a."
2,"In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,","Chu thla ni nga ni, (chu chu lal Jehoiakin sala ân tâng a kum ngana kum a na)."
3,"the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.","Kebar vadung panga Kaldaihai rama chun, Buzi naupa thiempu Ezekiel kuoma chun LALPA thu chu fietakin a hung tlung tah a; chutaka chun ama chunga chun LALPA kut chu a um a."
4,"And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.","Chun, ka hang en a, ngai ta, hmârtienga inthawkin thlipui nasa- tak a hung hrâng a, sûm nasatak, meia inlap pup pup, a vêl po poa var, a mei lai tak darsen tle anga tle zur zur a um a."
5,And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man;,"Chun, chutaka inthawk chun thilhring ang pali an hung suok a. Hi hi an inlang dân chu a nih: mihriem hawina an nei a."
6,"and every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.","Hmai pali an nei chit a, thla pali an nei chit bawk a."
7,And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.,An kehai chu ke intluon ringawt hi an na; an kephahai chu bâwngtê kepha ang a nih; dârsen nâwttle angin an tleh a.
8,And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings thus:,"An sîr lia an thlahai hnuoia chun mihriem kuthai ang kut an nei a; chuongchun, an pali chun chuong ang chun thlahai le hmaihai chu an nei a;"
9,their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.,"an thlahai chu ân zawmtuo seng a, an fe pha khawmin an inher ngai nawh a; an rêng el chun hmatieng ngawt an fe el hlak a nih."
10,"As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.","Chun, an hmaihai inangpui thua chun, mihriem hmai ang an nei a; an pali chun changtieng panga chun sakeibaknei hmai ang an nei a; an pali chun vawitieng panga chun bâwngchal hmai ang an nei a; an pali chun mupui hmai ang hi an nei chit bawk a."
11,"And their faces and their wings were separate above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.","Chun, a chungtienga chun an thlahai an zâr a; an rêng chun, an thla pahnihai chu an zâr zawm a; pahnihai chun an taksa chu ân khum a."
12,"And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.","Chun, an rêng el chun, hma- tieng zâwng ngawtin an feh a; thlarau a fena tieng tienga chun an fe ve a; an fe lai chun sîrtieng an inher ngai nawh."
13,"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.","Chuong thilhringhai laia chun thil pakhat, meiling chawklai ang, meiser ang el, thilhringhai laia asuk atunga fe a um a, mei chu a var hle a, meia inthawk chun kâwlinlep a suok a."
14,And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.,"Chun, thilhringhai chu kâwl inlep var inkhaw ang hin an tlân a, an kîr nâwk a."
15,"Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.","Chu thilhringhai ka en zing lai chun, thilhringhai sîra chun tawlailîr ke, pakhat chutaka hmai palihai pakhat senga dingin, hnuoi chunga chun ka hmuh a."
16,The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.,"Chu tawlailîr ke inlang dân le an sinthaw chu berul lung zie ang a na, an pali chun inangna an nei seng a; an inlang dân le an sinthaw dân chu tawlailîr kekuol sûnga tawlailîr kekuol um ang a nih."
17,"When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.","An fe pha khawm, an sîr lia chun an feh a; an fe pha chun an inher ngai nawh."
18,"As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.","An kekuolhai chu, an insângin ṭi an um hle a; an pali chun kekuol mita siphai chu an nei seng a."
19,"And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.","Thilhringhai chu an fe pha chun, tawlailîr kekuolhai khawm chu an sîra chun an fe ve pei a, chun, tawlailîr kekuolhai chu, thilhring- hai chu hnuoia inthawka dawm kâng an ni pha chun, an inkâng ve pei a."
20,"Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.",Khâw tieng tieng khawm thla- rau a fena tienga chun an feh a; thlarau chu a fena tieng tienga chun tawlailîr kekuolhai khawm chu an sîra chun dawm kângin an um a; thilhringhai thlarau chu tawlailîr kekuolhaia chun a um sih a.
21,"When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.","Sâwngsaw an fe pha, hieng khawm hi an feh a; sâwngsaw an ngîr pha hieng khawm hi an ngîr a; chuonghai chu hnuoia inthawka dawm kâng an ni chun, tawlailîr kekuolhai khawm chu an sîra chun dawm kâng an ni veh a, thilhringhai thlarau chu tawlailîr kekuolhaia chun a um sih a."
22,"And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.","Thilhring lua chun vân ang el krustal lung ṭiumtak zie ang, chung- tienga an lu chunga inzâm suok hi a um a."
23,"And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.","Chun, vân ang hnuoia chun an thlahai, tuok khat chu thilhring dang tâwkin ân zâr a; tuok khat dang chun an taksa an inkhum a."
24,"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.","Chun, an lâwn pha chun, an thla ri chu: tui nasatak ri ang elin, Iengkimthawthei râwl ri ang elin, sipai ruol ri ang, buoi mur mur ri ang ka hriet a. An ngîr pha chun, an thlahai chu an sie thlâk a."
25,"And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.","Chun, an luhai chunga vân chunga chun râwl ri a um a; an ngîr pha chun, an thlahai chu an sie thlâk a."
26,"And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.","An luhai chunga, vân chunga chun, lalṭhungpha ang, sapphir lung anga inlang a um a; lalṭhungpha angtak chunga chun mihriem anga inlang a um a."
27,"And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.","Chun, a kâwng chungtienga po chun ṭhihna zie ang, a vêla a sûnga mei anga inlang ka hmu bawk a; chun, a kâwng le a hnuoitieng inlang dâna chun, mei anga inlangin ka hmuh a, ama vêla po po chun var chu a um a."
28,"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.","Ruo sûr nia sûma sumrisâng inlang angin, a vêla varna inlang dân chu a um a. Hi hi LALPA ro- puina angpui inlang dân chu a nih. Chun, chu chu ka hmu phing chun, bawkkhupin ka tlu a, chun, mi pakhat râwl thu hung hrilin ka hriet a."
