1,"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,—","Chuleichun, kei Paula, nangni Jentailhai leia Krista Isu mi intâng hin."
2,if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;,Nangni tienga Pathien lungin- sietna enkawlna sin a mi pêk kha lo hre ta ngei in ta;
3,"how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,","khânga thurûk chu inhriettirnaa inhriettira ka um kha, inhmaa tawitea ka ziek ang thu kha."
4,"whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;","Kha lei khan in tiemin, Krista thurûk ka hriet zie hi hre thei in tih."
5,"which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;","Chu chu tulaia a tirko inthieng- hai le zâwlnei inthienghai kuoma Thlarau inhriettirin a um ta ang hin, tuta hma tieng khan mihriem nauhai kuoma inhriettirin a um ngai nawh."
6,"to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,","Chu chu hi hi a nih: Chanchin Ṭha leiin, Krista Isua chun Jentailhai hi rohluopuihai, taksa pêngpuihai, thutiem dawngpuihai an ni hi."
7,"whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.","A thilthawtheina thaw zie anga, a thlâwna a pêk, Pathien lungin- sietna chu a mi pêk ang peia, chu Chanchin Ṭha rawngbâwltua siem ka nih."
8,"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;","Kei mi inthieng po po laia chîntak nêka chîn lem kuoma hin chu lunginsietna chu pêk a nih: Krista hausakzie suisuok ruollohai chan- chin chu Jentailhai kuoma hril ding le,"
9,and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;,thurûk chatuona inthawka Pathien iengkim siemtua inthupa um enkawlna chu ieng am a ni ti mi po po inhriettir dingin.
10,"to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,","Chuongchun, tulaia vân hmun- haia khin inlalna le thuneinahai kuoma chun, Pathien varna tinrêng kohranhai leiin inhriettirin um thei a tih;"
11,according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:,"ei Lalpa Isua thaw a itum, a chatuon remruot ang pei chun."
12,in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.,"Chun, Krista Isu ei ring leiin amaa vêk chun nêlna le ngamtaka lût theina ei nei."
13,"Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.","Chuongchun, nangni leia rinum ka tuornahai lei hin beidawng lo dingin ka ngên cheu; chuonghai chu in ropuina a nih."
14,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,",Hi lei hin Pa hmaa chun ka dingṭhaṭhuon hlak:
15,"from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,",(Pa hnuoi le vâna sûngkuo tinrêng hming chawina chu);
16,"that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;","A ropuina hauzie ang peiin, a Thlarau zârah mihriem sûngril tienga chun thilthawtheinaa suk- hrâta ân umtir theina ding cheu le,"
17,"that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,","Krista chu ringna leia in lungril sûnga a chêng theina dingin; chuongchun, hmangainaa zung kei le, innghatna neia umin,"
18,"may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,","mi inthieng po pohai le chun, a lienzie dâm, a seizie dâm, ân thûkzie dâm, ân sângzie dâm hriet chieng theina le,"
19,"and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.","Krista hmangaina hriet phâk lo hriet theina nei a, Pathien famkimna tinrênga suksipa in um theina dingin."
20,"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,","Chuongchun, einia thaw hlak thilthawtheina ang peiin, ei hni le ei ngaituo po po nêka nasa lema thaw theitu kuoma ngei chun,"
21,unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.,"chatuonin, suon po po chenin kohrana le Krista Isua chun ropuina um raw se. Amen."
