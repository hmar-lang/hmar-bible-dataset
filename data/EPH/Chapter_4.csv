1,"I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,","Chuongchun, kei Lalpaa mi intâng hin ka ngên cheu–a kona cheu chu phua um dingin,"
2,"with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;","inngaitlâwmna le thuhnuoirawl- na po po neia, hmangainaa indâwtuo puma dâwtheina neia,"
3,giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.,inremna khuopnaa chun Thlarau inpumkhatna chu vawng dinga thaw dingin.
4,"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;","A ko san cheu beiseina hmun- khata ko in ni ang bawk khan, taksa pakhat le Thlarau pakhat chau a um a."
5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,","Lalpa pakhat, ringna hmunkhat, baptisma hmunkhat,"
6,"one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.","iengkim Pathien le Pa pakhat chau chu iengkim chungah a um a, iengkim fangsuokin a um a, iengkim sûngah a um bawk a nih."
7,But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.,"Nisienlakhawm, a thlâwna Kris- ta thilpêk inkhina ang peiin lungin- sietna chu ei kuom sengah pêk a nih."
8,"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men.","Chuleichun, “Chung tienga a hang fe lai khan, Sal intânghai chu a ṭhuoi a; Mihriemhai kuoma khawm, Thilpêkhai a pêk a,” a ti chu."
9,"(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?","(Chuongchun, “A hang fe,” ti hi, hnuoi hmun inhnuoitakahai a hung ṭum zet naw chun iengtin am ning a ta?"
10,"He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)","A hung ṭum kha, iengkim a suksip theina dinga, vân po po chung daia hang fe bawk kha a nih)."
11,"And he gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;","Chuongchun, ṭhenkhathai chu tirko ni ding dâmin, ṭhenkhathai chu zâwlnei ni ding dâmin, ṭhenkhathai chu Chanchin Ṭha hriltu ni ding dâm- in, ṭhenkhathai chu kohran châwmtu le inchûktirtuhai ni ding dâmin a pêk a:"
12,"for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ:","Krista taksa siem ṭha dinga, rawngbâwlna sin thawa, mi inthieng- hai sukfamkim dinga,"
13,"till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:","ringna le Pathien Naupa hrietna kawnga chun thukhat vuoa puitlinga, Krista famkimna lienzie tluka ei rênga ei hung um theina dingin."
14,"that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;","Chuongchun, indiknawna zâwr- na angin, var vervêka mihriem hlêm fâwmin, inchûktirna thli tinrênga khing tieng khing tienga vawr le lên lên naupang ni ta nâwm ei nih a,"
15,"but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, even Christ;","hmangaia thu diktak hrilin, iengkimah amaah inṭhang lien thei lem ei tih; ama chu Lu a na, Krista chu."
16,"from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.","Ama zârah taksa pumpui chun inzawmna tinrêng thaw leia inrem- taka insuktuo le inzawm khâwmin, pêng tin sin thaw zie ang sengin, hmangainaa insiem ṭha dingin taksa chu a hung sukpung hlak a nih."
17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,","Chuongchun, hi hi ka hrilin Lalpaa chun kân hriettir cheu a nih: Jentailhai chu lungril hmanglo puta an um angin um ta naw unla,"
18,"being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;","hrietnawna anniah a um, chu hrietnawna lei chun Pathien hring- naa inthawka ṭhea hung umin, an hrietnaa chun an hung inthim a nih; an lungril a ngawng leiin,"
19,"who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.",Chuonghai chun iengkhawm an inhriet thei ta naw leiin thil inthiengnaw tinrêng duâmtaka thaw dingin hurnaah an inpumpêk tah a.
20,But ye did not so learn Christ;,Nangni ruok chun chuong angin Krista chu in inchûk nawh a;
21,"if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:","a rawl chu in ngai tah a, ama inchûktirhai in ni angin Isua thutak um chu inchûktirin in um tah a."
22,"that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit;","Chuleiin, in tienlai umdân kawnga mihriem hlui, hlêmna châknaa se deu deu kha hlîp thla unla;"
23,"and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind,","in lungril thlaraua chun a tharin hung um unla,"
24,"and put on the new man, that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.","mihriem thar, felna le inthieng- na indiktaka Pathien angpuia siem chun inthuom ro."
25,"Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.","Chuongchun, khêl hril bânin mani vênghai kuomah thu indiktak hril seng ro; inpêngtuo seng ei ni sih a."
26,"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:",Lunginsen unla khawm a suol ruok chu suol naw ro; in lungsen chu nisain tlâkpui naw raw se:
27,neither give place to the devil.,Diebol chu hmun inkien bawk naw ro.
28,"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need.","Inruhmang chun inru ta naw sien la, a tlasam kuoma pêk ding a nei theina dingin a kuta thil ṭha thawin inrim lem raw se."
29,"Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.","Thu ṭhanaw hrim in bauah suok naw sien la, a ṭul zie ang peia siem ṭha dingin thu ṭha suok lem raw se, a ngaituhai dingin lunginsietna a hung ni theina dingin."
30,"And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.","Chun, Pathien Thlarau In- thieng chu suklungngai naw ro, in- tlanna nia dingin amaa chun inchika in um kha."
31,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice:","Khâkna dâm, lunginsenna dâm, inngâwkna dâm, hrângna dâm, hrilsietna dâm po po bânsanin um raw se, suolna po po leh."
32,"and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.","Chun, inlunginsiet tuoa, lainat- na neiin um unla, Pathienin Kristaa a ngaidam ang bawk cheuin inngai- dam tuo ro."
