verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;","Chuongchun, a nau dittakhai angin Pathien umdân latuhai ni ro."
2,"and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.","Chun, Kristain a hmangai cheu a, riminhnik dinga Pathien kuoma thil inhlâna ding le, inthâwinaa ei aia ân pêk ang bawk khan, hmangainaah um ro."
3,"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;","Nisienlakhawm, mi inthienghai thawa mawi âwm tak hrimin, inditna le inthiengnawna po po, duamna leh nangni laiah a sâma sâm khawmin um naw raw se;"
4,"nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.","zâmaw dâm, thu teplo dâm, fiemthu dâm khawm, chuong chu a mawi naw a nih; chuong ti nêk chun lawmthu hril lem ro."
5,"For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.","Indithmang le mi inthiengnaw le mi duâm hrim hrim chu, (mi duâm chu milim betu a nih), Krista le Pathien rama chun chan hrim an nei nawh ti in hriet hle sih a."
6,Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.,"Tûkhawmin thu teplo mei meiin hlêm naw raw se cheu, chuong thil lei chun Pathien lunginsenna chu ringnaw nauhai chungah a tlung hlak sih a."
7,Be not ye therefore partakers with them;,"Chuleiin, anni inṭawmpui naw ro."
8,"for ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light","Inhma khan inthim in na, tu ruok hin chu Lalpaa chun var in hung ni ta hi, var nauhai angin um ro,"
9,"(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),",(var ra chu ṭhatna le felna le thutak po poah ânlang sih a).
10,proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;,Lalpa lâwmzâwng ieng am a na ti infie pei bawk unla.
11,"and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;","Chun, inthim thilthaw ra nei ngailohaia chun ṭhangna hrim nei naw ro, ṭhang nêk hmanin a thiemnawzie inhriettir lem ro;"
12,for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.,inrûka an thil thaw hlakhai chu a hril khawm inzak a um sih a.
13,But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.,"Amiruokchu, thil tinrêng a thiemnawzie inhriettira um hi var isuklang a ni hlak,"
14,"Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.","suklanga um taphawt chu var a ni sih a. Chuleiin, “Nang a in! meng la, Mithi laia inthawkin tho rawh. Chuongchun, Krista chun, Hung ên var a ti che,” a ti kha."
15,"Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;","Chuongchun, mi varnawhai anga um loin, mi varhai anga um lemin, in um dânah fîmkhur ro."
16,"redeeming the time, because the days are evil.",Nihai hi a ṭhat naw leiin remchângnahai inchaw pei ro.
17,"Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.","Chuleichun, invêt nuom naw unla, Lalpa ditzâwng ieng am a na ti lo hre lem ro."
18,"And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;","Chun, uoin inruiin um naw ro, chutaka chun insûm nawna a um sih a; Thlaraua sipin um lem ro."
19,"speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;","Inpâkna hlahai, Pathien hlahai, thlarau tieng hlahaia inbe tuoin, Lalpa chu in lungrilah hla sakpêkin, ṭingṭang kei pêk ro."
20,"giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista hmingin, Pathien, Pa ngei kuoma chun, iengkim chungah lâwmthu hril ro."
21,subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.,Krista ṭi dêkin intuklût tuo seng ro.
22,"Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.","Nuhmeihai, Lalpa kuoma in intuklût ang hin mani pasalhai kuomah intuklût seng ro."
23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.","Krista chu ama ngei taksa sandamtu nia, kohran lu a ni ang bawk hin, pasal chu a nuhmei lu a ni sih a."
24,"But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.","Chuongchun, kohran chu Krista kuoma ân tuklût ang bawkin, nu- hmeihai chu iengkimah an pasalhai kuomah intuklût raw hai se."
25,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;","Pasalhai, in nuhmeihai hma- ngai ro, Kristain kohran a hmangai a, a aia ama ân pêk ang khan,"
26,"that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,","kohran chu tuia sâwpa, thu chun sukfaia ân thieng theina dingin;"
27,"that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.","fainawna kai lo le, zûr lo le, chuong ang thil hrim put loa, inthieng le hmêlhem nawa um lemin, ama kuoma vêk kohran ropui taka a pêk theina dingin."
28,Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:,Chuong ang bawkin pasalhai khawmin mani taksa angin mani nuhmeihai chu an hmangai ding a nih. Mani nuhmei hmangaitu chu mani inhmangai a nih.
29,"for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;","Tukhawmin, mani taksa a theida ngai si nawh a, a châwmin a duot lem hlak a nih."
30,because we are members of his body.,Kristain kohran a châwma a duot ang hin; a taksa pênghai ei ni sih a.
31,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.","“Chuleiin, pasalin a nu le pa mâksanin a nuhmei chel a ta, chun, an pahni chun tisa pumkhat hung ni tâng an tih.”"
32,This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.,"Chu thurûk chu a ropui a nih; nisienlakhawm, kei chun Krista le kohran thu ka hrilna a nih."
33,Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.,"Iengkhawm ni sien la, nangni laia mi tûkhawmin mani ân hmangai ang bawkin, mani nuhmei hmangai seng raw hai se; nuhmei khawm chu a pasal ṭi dêk dingin fimkhur raw se."
