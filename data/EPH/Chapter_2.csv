verse_no,en,hmr
1,"And you did he make alive, when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins,","Nangni khawm in bawsiet le in suolhai leia thi in ni lai khan, a sukhring cheu a nih,"
2,"wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience;","chuongahai chun inhma khan hi khawvêl dân angin in um kha, boruoka thuneina lal, tuta awinaw nauhai sûnga sin thaw zingtu thlarau dân ang hin."
3,"among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:—","Chuong ringnaw nauhai laia chun, eini khawm inhma chun tisa le lungril nuomzâwng thawin, ei tisa châknahai angin ei um vawng a, mi danghai angin lunginsenna naua insieng hrim ei ni kha."
4,"but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chun lunginsietna a hauin, a mi hmangai- na nasatak lei khan,"
5,"even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved),","ei bawsietna leia thi ei ni lai meu khawmin, Krista ruolin a mi suk- hring veh a, (lunginsietnaa sandam in ni tah),"
6,"and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus:","Krista Isua chun ama ruol bawka mi keithoin, vân hmunhaiah ama kuom ngeiah a mîn ṭhungtir tah a,"
7,that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:,"Chuongchun, hun la hung tlung dinghaia chun Krista Isua hin ei chunga ngilneiin, a lunginsietna nasatzie chu inentir thei a tih."
8,"for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;","Ringna leia lunginsietnaa sandam in ni sih a, chu khawm chu nangnia inthawka suok a ni nawh a, Pathien thilpêk a nih."
9,"not of works, that no man should glory.","Thilthaw lei a ni nawh; chuong naw chun, miin suong rawi an tih."
10,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.","Thil ṭha thaw dinga Isu Kristaa chun siema umin, ama kut suok ei ni sih a, chu thil ṭha thaw chu ei umna dingin Pathienin a buotsai lâwk a nih."
11,"Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;","Chuleiin, hi hi hre zing ro: Inhmaa nangni tisaa Jentail, tisaa kuta siem “Sertan” an tihaiin, “Sertannaw,” an tihai,"
12,"that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.","khâng lai khan Krista boin, Israel khuoletui leh intuolkhat loin, khawvêla hin beiseina hrim nei lo le, Pathien boa umin, tiemna thu- thlunghaia mikhuola in um kha."
13,But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.,"Tu ruok hin chu Krista Isuah, nangni inhmaa hlataka umhai kha, Krista thisen chun sukhnaiin in lo um tah a."
14,"For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,","Ama chu ei inremna a nih, pâwl hnihai chu pumkhata siemin, an inkâr ping dangna bang chu a sukchim a;"
15,"having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, so making peace;","ama chun intaina, (ser le sâng thilhaia thupêk Dân um chu), a taksaa sukboin, amaa chun pahnihai chu mihriem thar pumkhata siem a, inremna a siem theina ding le,"
16,"and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:",kraws zâra taksa pumkhata pahnihai chu Pathien le ân remtir theina dingin: chu kraws chun intaina chu a sukhlum sih a.
17,"and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh:","Chun, a hungin nangni hlataka umhai kuomah inremna Chanchin Ṭha a hril cheu a, hnaitaka umhai kuoma khawm Chanchin Ṭha a hril bawk a."
18,for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.,"Ama zârin Thlarau hmunkhata, Pa kuoma lût theina ei nei ve ve a nih."
19,"So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,","Chuongchun, tuhin mikhuol le mi châm el in ni ta nawh a, mi inthienghai le chun tuol khat le Pathien sûnghai in ni ta lem a nih."
20,"being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;","Isu Krista ngei chu a kia lung pawimawtak niin, tirkohai le zâwlneihai lungphûm chunga bâwl in nih."
21,"in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;","Amaa chun lung rem tum senghai, inremtaka inchuktuokin, Lalpaa chun biekin inthiengah ân chang pei hlak a,"
22,in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.,"nangni khawm amaa chun, Thlaraua Pathien umna dinga rem khâwm in nih."
