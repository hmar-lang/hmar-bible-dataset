1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:","Paula, Pathien ditzâwnga Krista Isu tirko chun: Mi inthieng Ephesia um, Krista Isua mi ringumhai kuoma chun:"
2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ:",Ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pathien le Pa chu inpâkin um raw se. Ama chun vân hmunhaia thlarau tieng mal- sâwmpêkna tinrêngin Kristaa chun mal a mi sâwm a.
4,"even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:","Hmangainaa inthieng le, sawi- sêlboa ama hmaa ei um theina dingin leilung insieng hmain Kristaa chun a mi thlang a."
5,"having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,","Ama lungdit, a lâwmzâwng angin Isu Krista zârah ama ta dinga naua siem dingin a mi lo ruot lâwk tah a,"
6,"to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:",a lunginsietna ropuizie chu Dittaka a thlâwna a mi pêk chu inpâk dingin.
7,"in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,",A thisen leiin amaa chun ei intlanna ei nei a nih — a lunginsietna hauzie ang peia ei bawsietnahai ngaidamna chu.
8,"which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,",Chu lunginsietna chu amain vartak le remhretakin a mi vur a nih:
9,"making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him","a ditzâwng thurûk, a lungni- zâwngtaka amaa thaw a itum chu eini kuomah mîn hriettirin,"
10,"unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, I say,","hunbi kim hunah: iengkim — vâna thil umhai le hnuoia thil umhai khawm–Kristaah, amaa ngei chun fâwkkhâwm dingin a nih."
11,"in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will;","Ama ditzâwnga remruot ang peia iengkim thawtu tum anga ruot lâwk ni tain, amaa bawk chun a ro dinga siem kan nih,"
12,"to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:",keini Krista lo beisei hmasatu- hai hi a ropui inpâkna kan lo nina dingin.
13,"in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,—in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,","Amaa chun nangni khawm thutak thu, in sandamna Chanchin Ṭha chu, in ngaia ring khawm in ring hnungin, amaa chun a ta in nih ti Thlarau Inthieng tiem chun inchika in um kha."
14,"which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of God’s own possession, unto the praise of his glory.","Chu chu Pathien ropuizie inpâkna dinga, ama ta ngeihai intlan suok phaa ei rohluona dinga zakhamna a nih."
15,"For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which ye show toward all the saints,","Chuleiin, kei khawma Lalpa Isu ringna nangnia um le, mi inthienghai po po chunga in inlangtir hlak hmangaina chu, ka lo hrietin,"
16,"cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;",ka ṭawngṭainaahai chun in hming lamin nangni leia lâwmthu hril ka ma nawh;
17,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;","ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pathien, ropuina Pa chun, ama hrietna kawngah, varna le hriet chiengna thlarau a pêk theina ding cheuin."
18,"having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,","Chuongchun, in lungril mithai sukvara umin hieng hi hung hre thei in tih:"
19,"and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might","ama kona beiseina dâm, mi inthienghaia chun a ro hluo ding ropui hauzie dâm, a thahrui hrâtna thaw zie ang peia, keini a ringtuhai tienga a thilthawtheina inkhi ruolloa lien Krista chunga a thaw —"
20,"which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,","mithi laia inthawka a keitho lai le, inlalna dâm, thuneina dâm, thilthawtheina dâm, rorêlna po po dâm, hi khawvêla chau ni loa, khaw- vêl la hung tlung dinga khawma, hming sak tinrênghai chung daia vân hmunhaia a changtienga ân ṭhungtir laia kha."
21,"far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:","Chun, thil tinrêng a ke hnuoiah a sieh a, ama chu iengkim po po chunga lu dingin kohranhai kuoma chun a pêk a,"
22,"and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,","kohran chu a taksa a nih, iengkim tinrênga suksiptu famkimna chu."
