9,What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?,Sinthawtu chun a sininrimnaah ieng hlâwkna am a hmu a?
10,I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.,Chutaka an buoipui ngei ding mihriem nauhai kuoma chun Pathien chun sin dinga a pêk chu ka hmuh a.
11,"He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.","Thil tinrêng chu mâni hun senga mawi dingin a siem a; a bula inthawka a tâwp chena Pathienin sin a thaw chu mihriemin a hriet suok thei nawna dingin, an lungrilah khawvêl chu a ruotdet bawk a."
12,"I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.",An dam sûng poa thil ṭha thawa hlima um nêka an ta dinga ṭha lem iengkhawm a um nawh ti ka hriet a.
13,"And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.","Chun, mi tinin a sinthaw inrim- na po poa thil ṭha a chêna, a dâwna a fâk chu Pathien thilthlâwnpêk a nih."
14,"I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.","Pathienin a thaw taphawt kum- khuoa ding a nih ti ka hriet a; chu- taka chun iengkhawm belsa thei ni naw ni a, iengkhawm lâkṭhe thei ni naw nih; Ama hmaa mihriemhai chu an ṭit theina dingin Pathien chun a thaw tah a nih."
15,That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.,"Thil hung umhai chu um ta hnung dai kha a na, la hung ding khawm chu ni ta hnung dai kha a nih: thil fe liem ta hnung kha Pathien chun a hung lâk kîr nâwk pei a nih."
16,"And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.","Chu nawa khawm chun nisa hnuoia hin, rorêlna umnaa chun, rîtlona khawm a um a; felna umna hmuna chun rîtlona khawm a um ka hmuh a."
17,"I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.","Ka lungril chun, “Pathien chun mi fel le rilo chunga chun ro rêl a tih; sin tinrêng le thiltum tinrênga dingin hun a um sih a,” ka tih a."
18,"I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.","Ka lungril ma chun, “Mihriem nauhai lei a ni hi; Pathien chun anni chu a fie theina ding le, anni khawma ramsahai ang chau an nih ti an hrietsuok theina dingin,” ka tih a."
19,"For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.","Chu thil mihriem nauhai chunga tlung chu ramsahai chunga khawm a tlung sih a; pakhat a thi angin a dang khawm chu an thih a. Thuok angkhat nei seng an nih a, mihriem chun ramsahai nêka chung- hnungbîkna a nei nawh; thil po po chu teplo el a ni sih a."
20,"All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.","An rêngin hmun pakhatah an feh a; an rêngin pilvuta inthawk an na, an rêngin pilvut an inchang nâwk a."
21,"Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?",Mihriem thlarau chu chung- tieng a feh a; ramsa thlarau chu hnuoitieng hnuoiah a fe ti tuin am a hriet a?
22,"Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him?","Chuleiin, miin a sinthawhaia a hlim nêka ṭha lem iengkhawm ka hmu nawh; chu chu ama chanpuol a na, ama hnunga thil hung um dinghai chu hmu dingin tuin am ama chu hung ṭhuoi kîr tâng a ti leh?"
