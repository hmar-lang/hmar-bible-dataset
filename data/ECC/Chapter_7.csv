1,"A good name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than the day of one’s birth.",Hming ṭhat chu hriek hlutak nêkin a ṭha lem a; Mi a thi ni chu a pieng ni nêkin a ṭha lem bawk.
2,It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.,"Ruoiṭhena ina fe nêkin, lusûnna ina fe chu a ṭha lem; Chu chu mi po po tâwpna a ni sih a: Mi dam chun a lungrilah sie tlat a tih."
3,Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.,"Innuina nêk chun lungngaina a ṭha lem a, Hmêl lungngaina chun lungril a siemṭha sih a."
4,The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.,Mi var lungril chu lusûn inah a um a; Mi invêt lungril ruok chu hlim hlapna inah a um.
5,"It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.","Mi invêthai hlasak ngai nêk chun, Mi var kâwkna ngaithlâk a ṭha lem."
6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.","Bêl suong hnuoia hlinghai puok ṭak ṭak ang hi, Mi invêt innuina khawm chu a nih; Hi khawm hi teplo el a nih."
7,Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding.,"Matheilovin, nêksâwrna chun mi var chu a sukvêt a, Thamna chun lungril a suksiet."
8,Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.,Thil chu a ṭanna nêkin a tâwp chu a ṭha lem a; Lungrila zaidawthei mi chu lungrila chapo nêkin a ṭha lem.
9,Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.,"Lunginsen dingin i lungrilah inhmaw naw rawh, Lunginsenna chu mi invêthai ângsûnga um a ni sih a."
10,"Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.","“Tulai hun nêk hin tienlai nihai kha ieng ieng leia ṭha lem am a nih a?” ti naw rawh, Chu thil în dawnna chu varnaa inthawk a ni si nawh a."
11,"Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.","Varna hi rochan ang bawka ṭha a na, Anih, nisa hmutuhai ta ding lem chun a ṭha nasa zuol a nih."
12,"For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.",Tangka chu inhliekhuna a ni ang bawkin varna khawm chu inhliekhuna a na; Hrietna ṭhatna chu: varna neitu hringna chu a vawng himpêk a nih.
13,"Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?",Pathien sinthaw chu ngaituo ta; A kâwia a siem ta chu tuin am suktlûn thei a ta?
14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything that shall be after him.","Hlawtling nia chun hlim la, vângduoi nia chun ngaituo rawh; miin ama hnunga ding iengkhawm a hriet nawna dingin Pathien chun pakhat chu a dang ang bawkin a siem a nih."
15,"All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing.",Ka teplo nihaia chun hi po hi ka hmu tah a; mi fel ama felnaa thi bohmang chu a um a; mi rilo a thil suol thaw pum zinga dam sâwt hrep chu a um bawk a.
16,Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?,"Intifel talaw naw la, insukvar talaw bawk naw rawh; iengdingin am nang le nang insukbohmang i ta?"
17,"Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?","Rilo talaw naw la, invêt talaw bawk naw rawh; i hun tlung hmain iengdingin am thîng i ta?"
18,"It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.","Hi hi i chel tlat hi a ṭha a nih, chutaka inthawk chun i kut khawm la kîr naw rawh; Pathien ṭîtuhai chun an la hung suoksan vawng ding a ni sih a."
19,Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.,Varna chu mi var ta ding chun khawpuia rorêltu sâwm umhai nêk chun hrâtna a ni lem.
20,"Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.","Indiktakin, hnuoi chunga hin mi fel thil ṭha thaw a, thil suksuol ngailo an um nawh."
21,"Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;","Chun, mi thuhril nazawng ngaisak naw rawh, chuong naw chun, i siehlawin ṭawngsie ân phur che hre rawi i tih;"
22,for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.,nang ngei khawma chuong ang bawk chun mi danghai ṭawngsie în phur rawp hlak ti i lungrilin i hriet rawp sih a.
23,"All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.","Hi po po hi varnaa chun ka lo fie tah a, “Var tâng ka tih,” ka ta; amiruokchu, keimaa inthawk chun hlatak a nih."
24,"That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?",Chuong a hlata hla le nasataka inthûk chu tuin am hmu suok thei a ta?
25,"I turned about, and my heart was set to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.","Ka ngha kîr a, ka lungril chun, hre ding le, zawng ding le, varna zawng suok dingin le; rîtlona hi invêtna a nih ti hre ding le, invêtna chu intlâwkna a nih ti hre dingin ka thlîr vêl a."
26,"And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.","Chun, nuhmei a lungril chu chânghai le lênhai, a kuthai chu hnâng ang el neitu chu, thina nêka ṭha lem ka hmu suok a; tukhawm Pathien suklâwmtu chu amaa inthawk suok thleng an ta, amiruokchu, mi suol chu amanu chun man a tih."
27,"Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, laying one thing to another, to find out the account;","Thuhriltu chun, Ngai ta, hi hi ka hmu suok tah, a nizât hmu suok dinga thil pakhat zoa a dang la um pei hi;"
28,"which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.","chu chu ka lungril hin a zawng zing a, nisienlakhawm, ka la hmu suok nawh a; pasal pakhat sâng khat laia chu ka hmu suok a; amiruokchu, chuonghai lai po poa nuhmei pakhat chu ka hmu suok zo nawh."
29,"Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.","Ngai ta, hi chau hi ka hmu suok a, Pathien chun mi chu mi ngîl ni dingin a siem a, amiruokchu, anni chu mâni nuom dân dânin an khawsa ta lem a."
