1,"For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them.","Hi po po hi hmu suok dingin ka lungrila chun kân vawi tlat a, mi fel le mi var le an sinthawhai chu Pathien kutah a um a; an hmaa um chu ngainatum a ni le theidaum a ni tukhawmin an hriet nawh."
2,"All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.","Thil po po chu mi po po chungah angkhatin a hung tlung vawng a; mi fel le mi rilo chunga thil tlung khawm thuhmun a nih, mi ṭha le mi suol, mi inthieng le mi inthieng naw chung- a khawm; inthâwi hlak le inthâwi ngailo mi chunga khawm; mi ṭha chunga ang bawkin mi suol chunga khawm a nih, inkhâmtu chunga ang bawkin inkhâmna ṭitu chunga khawm chun."
3,"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.","Nisa hnuoia thawa um po po lai hi hi thil suol a nih: mi po po chunga thiltlung hmunkhat vawng a ni hi; anih, mihriem nauhai lungril chu thil ṭha nawa sip a na, an dam lai chun an lungrila chun invêtna a um a, chu hnung hlak chun mithi kuomah an fê tah a."
4,For to him that is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.,Mi hring rama la um ta ding chun beiseina a um a; sakeibaknei thi nêk chun ui hring chu a ṭha lem.
5,"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.","Mi hring chun an la thi ding a nih ti an inhriet sih a; mi thi ruok chun iengkhawm an hriet nawh, lâwmna iengkhawm an nei ta naw bawk a, anni chu hriet zing an ni ta bawk nawh."
6,"As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun.","An ngainat zâwng dâm, an theida zâwng dâm, an inhnar zâwng dâm chu a bohmang vawng tah a; nisa hnuoia thil thawa um tinrêng- haia chun kumkhuoin chan ding hrim an nei nawh."
7,"Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works.","Fe la, i bei chu hlimin fa la, i uoin chu lungril hlimin dâwn rawh; Pa- thien chun i sinthawhai chu a pawm ta sih a."
8,Let thy garments be always white; and let not thy head lack oil.,"I silfênhai chu vâr zing zing sien- la, i lu khawm chu sahriek intlâksam- tir naw rawh."
9,"Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity: for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labor wherein thou laborest under the sun.",Nisa hnuoia a pêk che i teplo dam sûng nihai po poah nuhmei i hmangai le chun hlimtakin um rawh; chu chu nisa hnuoia i sininrimnaa le i dam sûnga i chan a nih.
10,"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, whither thou goest.","I kutin sinthaw ding a hmu phawt chu i theitâwpin thaw la, i fêna ding thlâna chun varna amanih, hrietthiemna amanih, hlêmna ama- nih, sinthawna amanih a um ta si nawh a."
11,"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.","Ka thlîr nâwk a, nisa hnuoia chun intlânsiekna chu a hrâthai ta ding chau a ni nawh a, indona chu a hrâthai ta ding chau a ni nawh a, bei chu mi varhai ta ding chau a ni nawh a, hausakna chu hrietthiem- na nei mihai ta ding chau a ni nawh a, ditsakna chu themthiemhai ta ding chau a ni nawh; amiruokchu, hun le remchâng chu an rênga kuomah a tlung seng a ni lem ti ka hmu a."
12,"For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.","Mihriem chun a hun chu a hrietthiem nawh a; ngahai chu lên ṭiuma mana an um ang le, vatehai chu chânga an âwk angin chuong ang bawk chun, an chunga a hung tlung thut pha chun mihriem nauhai khawm chu hun ṭha nawa chun âwkin an um hlak a nih."
13,"I have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise, and it seemed great unto me:","Hieng ang kawng bawka hin nisa hnuoia chun varna chu a hmu a, ka ta ding chun ropuitakin ân lang a."
14,"There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.","Khawpui chitê, a sûnga mi tlâwmte um a um a; lal ropuitakin a hung rûn tah a, ân huol a, kul ropui- tak a bâwl khum a."
15,"Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.","Chun, a sûnga chun mi var pasetak hi a um a, a varna chun khawpui chu a sansuok tah a; ami- ruokchu, chu mi pasetak chu tu- khawma an hriet zing nawh a."
16,"Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.","Chun, kei chun, “Hrâtna nêkin varna hi a ṭha lem a ni hi, mi pase- tak varna chu hmusit niin, a thuhai chu ngaisak ni naw sien khawm,” ka tih a."
17,The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.,Mi var thu damtereka hril khawm chu invêthai laia rorêltu khêk nêk chun hriet a ni lem a.
18,Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much good.,"Varna chu indona thuomhnaw- hai nêkin a ṭha lem a; amiruokchu, mi suol pakhat khawma nasatakin a suksiet a nih."
