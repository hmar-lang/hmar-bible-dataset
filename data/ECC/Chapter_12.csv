1,"Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;","I vânglai nihaia chun nangma Siemtu che chu hre zing la, kumhai a hung hnai a, ni ṭha nawhai a hung tlung hma le;"
2,"before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;","chu huna chun, “Annia chun inhawitina ka nei nawh,” i tina hun a hung tlung hma hin; nisa amanih, var amanih, thla amanih, arasihai amanih an inthim hmain, sûmhai chu ruo hnunga an hung ki nâwk hma hin."
3,"in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened,","In vêngtuhai chu an inthin a, mi hrâthai chu an kûn a, bu râwttuhai chu an tlâwm leia an maa, tukvera dâkhai chu an inthim nia chun;"
4,"and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;","kawtthlêrahai chun kawtkhâr- hai khâr a na, thil râwt rihai chu a hung dei a, mi chu vate râwl ria chun a hung tho a, thil ri mawi naunu- hmeihai po po chu sukhnuoi an hung na;"
5,"yea, they shall be afraid of that which is high, and terrors shall be in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:","anni chun ân sâng chu an ṭih a, lampuia chun ṭitna a hung um a, almond thing chu a hung kumûm a, khâuṭhikṭhihai chu buoipuium an hung ni a, nuom zâwng dâm chun a hung hlawsam a, mi chu a chatuon ina chun a fe ta leiin le, lusûnhai chun kawtthlêrhai chu an fang leiin le;"
6,"before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,","tangkaraw hrui chu suktan a ni leiin le, rângkachak maihûn amanih, tuibêl kekuol chu a tliekin amanih; Pil bêl amani chu tuikhura chun sukkawi a ni leiin amanih,"
7,"and the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it.",pilvut chu a nina anga hnuoia a kîr nâwk hmain le thlarau chu ama petu Pathien kuoma a kîr nâwk hmain.
8,"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.","“Teplohai teplo,” Thuhriltu chun a tih, thil po po hi teplo a nih."
9,"And further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.","Chu bâka chun, Thuhriltu hi a var leiin, mihai chu hrietthiemna ân chûktir hlak a, anih, a ngaituoh a, a zawngsuok a, thuvar tamtakhai chu indawt peiin a sieh a."
10,"The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written uprightly, even words of truth.","Thuhriltu chun thu pawmtlâk- hai chu hmu suok dingin a zawng a, chuong zieka umhai chu thu ngîl, thudik thuhai chu an nih."
11,"The words of the wise are as goads; and as nails well fastened are the words of the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.","Mi var thuhai chu hmawl a hmawra thilzum um ang a na, chun, Berâm vêngtu pakhata inthawka pêk thuvar lâk khâwmhai chu thîrkil vuok det tlat ang chu a nih."
12,"And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.","Chun, chu bâka chun, ka naupa, infuiin um la, lekhabu tamtak siem hin tâwp lêm a nei nawh a; inchûk tam khawm hi taksa inrimna chau a nih."
13,"This is the end of the matter; all hath been heard: Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.","Hi hi thil tâwp chu a nih; thil po po chu hriet a ni tah a; Pathien ṭî la, a thupêkhai chu zâwm rawh; hi hi mi- hriem thilthaw ding pumpui chu a nih."
14,"For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.","Pathien chun sin tinrêng chu rorêlnaah a hung lâk lût ding a ni sih a, thil inthuphai po po le, a ṭha khawm a ṭha naw khawm chu."
