1,"I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.","Ka lungrilin, “Khaw he, hlim hlapna chu infieng ka tih, inhawi chênin,” kân tih a; hi khawm hi teplo el bawk a nih."
2,"I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?","Innui ngawt el chu “Invêtna”, a nih a, Nunkhuo phâm hlak ienga ṭhangkai a ni nawh ti ka hriet suok tah a."
3,"I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.","Ka lungril chun ka tisa chu uoina sukhlim ka tum a, varna chu ka lungrila zawng pei zingin, invêtna chu chel tlatin, vân hnuoia an dam sûng tawitea mihriem nauhai thaw dinga ṭha chu ieng am a ni ti ka hmu thei rawi mawh tiin;"
4,I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;,"Sin ropuitakhai kân siempêk a, inhai kân bâwlpêk a, grep huonhai kân phunpêk a,"
5,"I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;","huonhai le lênghmunhai kân siempêk a, chuonga chun theira chi po pohai ka phun a;"
6,"I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;",thinghai phunna ramhnuoi chu tuia buokna dingin tuidîlhai kân siempêk a;
7,"I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;","siehlawpahai, siehlawnuhai kân châwk a, ka ina siehlaw pieng hrimhai dâm ka nei bawk a; ka hmaa Jerusalema lo um tahai po po nêk khan berâm ruol le bâwng ruol khawm ka nei nasa lem a."
8,"I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.","Rângkachak le tangka kân khâwlpêk a, rambung le lalhai ro thil bîkhai dâm le chun. Pasal hlasaktu le nuhmei hlasaktuhai, mihriem nau- hai lâwm zâwng ang, thaikêm khawm tamtak ka nei a."
9,"So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.","Chuongchun, ka ropui hlein, Jerusalema keia hmaa umhai po po nêk khan ka nasa lem a; ka varna hlak chu ka kuomah a um zing bawk a."
10,And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.,"Chun, ka mithaiin a châk taphawthai chu, chuonga inthawk chun kân sûm nawh a, hlimna ienga inthawk khawmin ka lungril chu kân sûm ngai nawh a, ka sininrimna po poa chun ka lungril chu a hlim a; ka sininrimna po poah hi hi ka chanpuol a nih."
11,"Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.","Chun, ka kuthaiin sin a lo thaw ta po po chu ka en a, chuonghai thawa ka lo sininrimna tahai po po chu teplo el le, lungril rimsikna el a nih, nisa hnuoia hin hlâwkna hrim a lo um nawh ti ka hmuh a."
12,"And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been done long ago.","Chun,invêtna le intlâwkna le varna chu hmu dingin kân her a; mi lal hung thlâktu khawm chun ieng am a thaw thei chuong a? a hmaapa thaw tasa bawk chau chu a nih."
13,"Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.","Chun, varin inthimna chu a khûm angin, varna khawm chun invêtna chu a khûm ti ka hmu tah a."
14,"The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.","Mi var mithai chu a lua chun a um a, mi invêt ruok chu inthimah a lâwn; amiruokchu, an rênga chungah khawrêl angkhat a tlung tho ti ka hmuh a."
15,"Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.","Chun, ka lungrila chun, “Mi invêt chunga thil tlung ang bawk chu ka chunga khawm a tlung ve ding a na; chuong a ni chun ieng dinga var bîk hle am ka nih a?” kân tih a. Ka lungril ma chun, “Hi khawm hi teplo el a nih” ka tih a."
16,"For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!",Mi invêt ang thoin mi var khawm chu kum khuoa hriet zingna um naw nih. Mi invêt ang bawka mi var khawm chu a thi ngei dingzie chu aw!
17,"So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.","Chuleiin, nisa hnuoia sin thawa um chu ka ta dinga a lungzingthlâk leiin, nun hi ka chim a nih; thil po po chu teplo el, lungril rimsikna el a ni sih a."
18,"And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.","Chuongchun, mi keia hnunga la hung um ding ta dingin ka mâksan el ding a ni ti ka hmuin nisa hnuoia ka sininrim, chu ka sin thawinrimna po po chu ka theida a nih."
19,"And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.","Chun, mi invêt a ni ding le mi var a ni ding tuin am hrieng a ta? Nisa hnuoia ka varna hmanga ka sininrimna po po ra neitu a la ni ding a ni si a. Hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih."
20,Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.,"Chuleichun, nisa hnuoia ka sininrimna, chu sininrimna po po chungthua chun ka lungril chu ka sukbeidawng dêr tah a."
21,"For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.","Achâng chun mi varna, hriet- thiemna le themthiemna le sinin- rimna, ana hlak, a thaw suoksa chu sininrim nawin a chên el dinga maksanpêk a um bawk a. Hi khawm hi teplo el a na, suol nasatak a nih."
22,"For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?","Miin a sininrimna po po le a lungril rimsikna, nisa hnuoia a rim- siknaa chun ieng am a hmu a?"
23,"For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.","A nihai po po chu nat tuornaa sip a nih a, a sininrimna hlak lung- zîngna ruok a nih a; anih, zâna chen khawm a lungril chun châwl hrim a hmu nawh. Hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih."
24,"There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.","Miin a sinthaw inrimnaah a lungril a sininrimna a dâwn a, a fâk nêka ṭha lem, mi ta dingin ieng dang khawm a um nawh. Hi khawm hi ka hmu tah a, Pathien kuta inthawk bawk a nih."
25,"For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?","Keia nêka nasain tuin am inhawitir theiin, tuin am fa thei a ta?"
26,"For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.","Pathien chun ama suklung- awitu kuoma chun varna le hriet- thiem theina le hlimna a pêk a, mi suol kuoma ruok chun Pathien suk- lungawitu kuoma pêk dinga lâk- khâwmna le siekhâwlna sin a pêk a. Hi khawm hi teplo el a na, lungril rimsikna el a nih."
