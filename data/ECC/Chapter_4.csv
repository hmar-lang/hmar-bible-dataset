1,"Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.","Chun, ka thlîr a, nisa hnuoia nêksâwrna thawa umhai po po chu ka hmuh a; chun, nêksâwra umhai mitthlihai chu ka hmu bawk a; thlamuontu hrim an nei nawh; nêk- sâwrtuhai tienga chun thilthaw- theina a um a, nisienlakhawm, anni chun thlamuontu hrim an nei nawh."
2,Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive;,"Chuleiin, mi hring la dam zing- hai nêk hmanin, mi thi, thi ta hnung- hai chu vângnei lemah ka ngai tah a;"
3,"yea, better than them both did I esteem him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.","anih, chuhai ve ve nêk chun, nisa hnuoia thawa um sin rilo la hmulo le, la um ngailo ni chu a ṭha lem a nih."
4,"Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.","Chun, mi chu a tuolbâwmin a thîkna hlak san, sinthaw hlawtling le sininrimna tinrênghai po po chu ka hmuh a. Hi khawm hi teplo el, lungril rimsikna el a nih."
5,"The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.","Mi invêt chun a kuthai a kuoh a, ama tisa ngei chu a fâk a."
6,"Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.","Lungril rimsikna le sinrimnaa kut sip hni nêkin, dei zawta kut sip khat chu a ṭha lem."
7,Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.,"Chun, ka thlîr nâwk a, nisa hnuoia chun teplo el chu ka hmuh a."
8,"There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, saith he, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.","Mi pakhat naupasal amanih, unaupa amanih khawm pakhat khawm nei lo a um a; ana hlak chu, a sininrimna po po chun tâwp hrim a nei nawh a, a mithai chu hausaknaa chun a tlai ngai bawk nawh a. “Tu ta ding taka hienga mâni inhawitirna chân raka sininrim am ka ni lie?” khawm a ti ngai nawh. Hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih; anih, tuorna natak a ni chau a nih."
9,"Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.","Pakhat nêk chun pahni chu an ṭha lem a, an sininrimnaa chun lâwmman ṭhatak an hmu leiin."
10,"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.","An tlu chun, a pakhat chun a ruolpa chu a keitho ding a ni sih a; makhâta um ruok chu a chung a rik, a tlûk lai khawma ama keithotu ding khawm nei lo chu."
11,"Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?",Chunawa khawm mi pahni zâl hmunkhat chu an insuklum a; pakhat chau ruok chu iengtin am insuklum a ta?
12,"And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.","Mi makhâta um chu hne el thei ni sien khawm, pahni chun lo dodâl thei an tih. Hruol zai thum neia siem chu awlrawnga suktan a ni ngai nawh."
13,"Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.","Lal tar invêt, thurâwn khawm pawm nachâng hre ta lo nêk chun tleirâwl var le rimsi khawm chu a ṭha lem,"
14,"For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.","lungina inthawka lal ni dinga hung suok amanih, a lalram sûng ngeia mi rimsia pieng hrim khawm ni sien."
15,"I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.",Nisa hnuoia mi hring inzi nuoi nuoi po po chu lal aia la hung ngîr ding tleirâwl zui ruokin ka hmuh a.
16,"There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.","Mi an chunga a umnahai po po chu hriet sêng ruol an ni nawh a, amiruokchu, ama hnunga hunghai chu amaa chun hlim chuong naw ni hai. Matheiloin hi khawm hi teplo el a na, lungril rimsikna el a nih."
