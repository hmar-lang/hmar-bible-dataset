1,"The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.","Jerusalema lal, David naupa Thuhriltu thuhai chu:"
2,"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.","“Teplohai teplo, Thuhriltu chun, teplohai teplo! Thil po po hi teplo a nih,” a ta."
3,What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun?,"Miin a sininrimna, nisa hnuoia a sininrimna po poa chun ieng am hlâwkna a hmu a?"
4,"One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.","Suon khat a fe liem a, suon dang a hung suok a; Leihnuoi ruok hi chu a um ngaiin a um zing a."
5,"The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.","Nisa chu a hung suok a, nisa chu a tla nâwk a, A hung suokna hmun ma chu a tlung nâwk vak a."
6,"The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.","Thli chu simtieng a hrâng a, hmartieng a kîr nâwk a. A vêl a vêlin thli chu a hrâng a, Chu thli chu a fe kuolnaa bawk chun a kîr nâwk a."
7,"All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.","Vadunghai po po chu tuisuorietah an luong lût a, Anachu tuisuoriet chu a sip nawh a: Vadunghai chu an hung suokna hmun tiengah, chutieng ma chun an kîr nâwk a."
8,"All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.","Thil po po hi inrimna el a nih; miin a hril thei nawh; A hmua hmuin mit chu a tlai ngai nawh a, A hrieta hrietin na khawm chu a sip ngai bawk nawh."
9,That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.,"Thil ni tasa kha, thil la hung ni ding chu a na; Thaw tasa kha la thaw ding chu a nih: Nisa hnuoia hin thil tharlâm hrim a um nawh."
10,"Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.","Miin, “En ta, hi hi a thar a nih” an ti ding thil hrim a um am a nih? Einihai hmaa lo um ta dai ruok an nih;"
11,"There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that are to come, among those that shall come after.","Hi hma thilhai hriet zingna a um nawh a, La hung um ding thilhai khawm chu Suon hung um dinghai laia tukhawmin hre zing chuong naw nih."
12,I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.,Kei Thuhriltu hi Jerusalema Israelhai chunga lal ka ni tah a.
13,And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.,Vânkhuphnuoia thil thawa um ta po po chungthu chu varnaa zawnga zawng suok dingin ka lungril ka lo hmang tah a; Pathienin mihriem nauhai buoipui dinga a pêk chu sin rinumtak a nih.
14,"I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.","Nisa hnuoia sin thawa um tahai po po chu ka hmu tah a; chun, ngai ta, thil po po chu teplo el, lungril sâwlna el a nih."
15,That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.,"A kâwi ta hlak chu siem tlûn thei a ni nawh a, Chun, a um naw hlak tiem el thei a ni hliek nawh a."
16,"I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.","Ka lungrilin, “Ka hmaa Jerusa- lema umhai po po nêkin varna ka nei nasa lem a nih, ka lungril khawmin hrietthiemna le varna nasatak a nei a,” ka tih a."
17,"And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.","Chun, intlâwkna le invêtna hre dingin le, varna chu hre dingin ka lungril ka sêng a; hi khawm hi nuom- hmanglo el a niin ka hriet tah a."
18,For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.,Varna tamtak umnaa chun lungngaina tamtak a um veh a; Hrietna insukpungtu khawm chun lungngaina ân sukpung bawk a nih.
