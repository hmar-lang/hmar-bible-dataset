verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.",Mi var ang hi tu am a um a? Thil umze hrie tu am a um a? Mi a varna chun a hmêl chu a sukvar a. A hmêl inrumna khawm chu a danglam tah.
2,"I counsel thee, Keep the king’s command, and that in regard of the oath of God.","Thu ka râwn che; Lal thupêk chu pawisa rawh, Pathiena în khâmna lei chun."
3,Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.,"A hmaihmaa inthawk fe suok inhmaw naw la, thil suol khawm thaw zing naw rawh; a nuom zâwng taphawthai chu a thaw si a."
4,"For the king’s word hath power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?","Lal thu chun thilthawtheina a nei leiin, tuin am a kuomah, “Ieng am i thaw a” ti thei a ta?"
5,Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment:,Tukhawm thupêkhai pawmtu chun thil ṭha naw tuok naw nih; mi var lungril chun hun indik le a kawnglam a hriet.
6,for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him:,Thil tinrênghai chun hun le kawnglam an nei si a; mihriem buoina chu a chungah nasa hle sien khawm.
7,for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?,"Thil la hung tlung ding chu a hriet si nawh a, a la hung ni dân ding chu tuin am hril thei a ti leh?"
8,There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.,"Thlarau chu chel dingin, thlarau chunga thuneina nei mihriem an um nawh; thi ni chunga khawm chun thuneina an nei bawk nawh; chun, indonaa chun châwl a um bawk nawh; chu chu kuoma pêka um ta chu rîtlona chun ama rîtlona chu sansuok naw nih."
9,"All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt.",Hi po po hi ka hmu tah a; nisa hnuoia sin po pohaia chun ka lungril chu ka hmang tah a; mi pakhatin mi dang chungah ama le ama ân suknatna ding elin thuneina a nei hun chu a nei a nih.
10,"So I saw the wicked buried, and they came to the grave; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.","Chun, mi rilo chu phûma a um ka hmuh a, thlâna chun an hung a; chuong thil thaw diktuhai chu hmun inthienga inthawk chun an fê hmang a, khawpuia chun anni chu theinghil an ni tah a; hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih."
11,"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.","Sin ṭha naw chunga thu rêl thlûk chu inrangtaka suksuok a ni ngai nawh a, chuleichun, mihriemhai naupasalhai chun thil suol thaw dingin an lungril chun a tin rân hlak a nih."
12,"Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:","Mi suol chun thil ṭha naw vawi za thawin a dam sûng nihai chu suksei tho sien khawm; matheiloin, Pathien ṭituhai ta ding chun, ama hmaa an ṭi leiin, a ṭha ding a nih ti ka hriet a;"
13,"but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.","amiruokchu, mi rilo ta ding chun ṭha naw nih a, a dam sûng ni- hai khawm chu suksei pha naw bawk a tih; chu chu hlim ang el hi a na; Pathien hmaa chun a ṭî naw leiin."
14,"There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.","Hnuoi chunga hin thil teplo thaw tah a um a; mi fel chu an um a, an kuoma khawm chun mi rilohaiin an thaw ang angin a tlung a nih; chun, mi rilohai an um bawk a, an kuoma khawm chun mi felhai sin- thaw ang ang chun a tlung ve bawk a nih. Hi khawm hi teplo bawk a nih ka tih."
15,"Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.","Chun, miin hlima uma, fâka dâwn nêka nisa hnuoia hin thil ṭha lem a nei naw leiin, nuomsipna hi ṭha ka ti el a nih; nisa hnuoia Pathienin ama a lo pêk tah a dam sûng nihaia po po chun a sininrimna chu a kuoma chun a um ding a ni sih a."
16,"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),","Hnuoi chunga sin thawa um- hai chu hmu ding le, varna chu hre dinga ka lungril ka hmang lai chu: (sûna manih zâna mani khawma mithaiin îmu a hmu nawzie dâm chu);"
17,"then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.","nisa hnuoia sin thawa um, mi- hriemhaiin an hmu suok thei naw, Pathien sinthaw chu ka hmuh a; ieng ang khawmin, miin zawngin nasatak- in thaw inrim sien khawm, hmu suok chuong naw nih; mi var khawma hriet inring sien khawm hmu suok chuong bawk naw nih."
