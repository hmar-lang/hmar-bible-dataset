1,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:","Nisa hnuoia hin thil suol ka hmu chu a um a, mihriemhai chunga chun a rik hle a;"
2,"a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but an alien eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.","Pathienin mi neinungna le hau- sakna le inzâumna a pêk a, chuong- chun, a lungrilin a dit zâwng taphawt chu tlâksam hrim a nei nawh a; amiruokchu, Pathien chun chuonghai fâk theina a pêk tlat nawh a, ami- ruokchu, mikhuol chun a fâk ta lem a; hi khawm hi teplo el a na, natna ṭha lo a nih."
3,"If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul be not filled with good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he:","Miin nau za nei sienla, kum tamtak dam sienla, a kum nihai chu tam hle sienla, amiruokchu, a lungril chu thil ṭhain a tlai nawh a; chu nawa khawm phûmna a hlaw bawk si naw chun, ama nêk chun a hun nawh a pieng khawm chu a ṭha lem a nih ka ti a nih;"
4,"for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness;","teploah a hung a, inthima chun a fê hmang a, a hming chu inthimnain ân khum a:"
5,moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath rest rather than the other:,"chu nawa chun nisa chu a hmu ngai nawh a, hriet khawm a hriet nawh a; hi hin mi dang nêk hmanin châwlna a nei lem a nih."
6,"yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoy no good, do not all go to one place?","Anih, kum sâng vawi hni dam sienla, thil ṭha a chang chuong naw chun, mi po po thuhmun vawng an ni naw am a nih?"
7,"All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.","Mihriem sininrimna po po chu a bau ta ding a na, amiruokchu, phîng- ṭâmna chu suksip a ni chuong nawh."
8,"For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? or what hath the poor man, that knoweth how to walk before the living?","Mi var chun mi invêt nêkin ieng am hlâwkna a hmu chuong leh? Annawleh, mi hringhai hmaa fê dân hrie mi rimsi chun ieng am a nei a?"
9,Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.,"Nuom zâwng ram tin nei nêk chun mithaia hmu chu a ṭha lem a; hi khawm hi teplo el, lungril rimsikna el a nih."
10,"Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he.","Ieng po khawm lo um ta kha a hming sâwttaka sak tah a nih a; chun, mihriem chu ieng am a na ti khawm hriet a ni sa tah a, ama nêka thilthawthei lem chu a khing zo nawh;"
11,"Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?","Thu a tam po leh teplo a tam pei a, mihriem ta dingin iem a ṭhat lemna?"
12,"For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?","A dam sûnga dingin tuin am mihriem ta dinga thil ṭha chu a hriet a, a dam sûng teplo nihai po po chu hlim angin a hmangral el a ni naw maw? Nisa hnuoia hin ama hnungah ieng am a hung um ding tuin am mi a hril thei a?"
