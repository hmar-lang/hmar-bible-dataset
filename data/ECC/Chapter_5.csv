1,Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.,"Pathien ina i fe pha chun i ke vêng ṭha rawh, invêthai inthâwina inhlân nêk chun ngai dinga va hnai chu a ṭha lem sih a; thil ṭha naw an thaw ti an hriet si nawh a."
2,"Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.","I bauin ti rawk rawk naw la, Pathien hmaa thil iengkhawm hril dingin inhmaw naw rawh; Pathien chu vânah a um a, nang chu hnuoia um i ni sih a; chuleiin, i thu chu suktlâwm rawh."

5,"Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.","În khâma i hlen si naw nêk chun, în khâm naw law law kha a ṭha lem."
6,"Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?","I tisa chu suksuoltir dingin i bau chu phal naw la; Pathien mitirhai hmaa chun ân dik naw a nih, ti bawk naw rawh; ieng dingin am Pathien chu i râwla chun lunginsenin i kut sinthawhai chu a sukbohmang el ding chu?"
7,"For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words: but fear thou God.","Mang tamtak le, thu tamtakhaia chun teplo tamtak a um a; nang ruok chun Pathien ṭi rawh."
8,"If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter: for one higher than the high regardeth; and there are higher than they.","Mi rimsi chu nêksâwra a um a, rambunga thawluina chun rorêlna le indikna chu lâk hmang i hmu chun, chu thila chun makti naw rawh, hotu insâng chu a nêka insâng lem chun a enthlit zing sih a, anni nêka insâng lem khawm chu an la um pei a nih."

10,"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.",Tangka ngainatu chu tangkaah lungawi naw nih a; hausakna ngai- natu khawm hlâwknaa chun lungawi bawk naw nih: hi khawm hi teplo el a nih.
11,"When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof, save the beholding of them with his eyes?","Thilhai chu an hung pung chun, a fatuhai khawm an hung pung pei a nih; chutaka chun a neitu ta ding chun, a mithaia a hmu chau ti naw chu ieng am ṭhangkaina a um chuong leh?"
12,"The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.","Mi sinthaw inrim îmu chu ân hnik a, fa tamin fa tlâwm sien khawm; amiruokchu, hausa chu a hausakna chun inintir phal naw nih."
13,"There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt:","Nisa hnuoia thil ṭha naw lung- zingthlâktak ka hmu a um a; chu chu, hausaknahai a neituin ama le ama insuknatna ding chaua a kawl hi a nih;"
14,"and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.","chuong hausaknahai chu tuor- na khawhloah an bohmang a; nau- pasal a nei a, anachu a kuta chun iengkhawm a um nawh."
15,"As he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.","A nu phîng sûnga inthawka a hung suok ang khan, a ruok bawkin fê nawk a ta, a sininrimna man, a kuta a chawi thei khawm chu ieng- khawm fêpui naw nih."
16,"And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that he laboreth for the wind?","Chun, hi khawm hi thil ṭha naw lungzingum tak chu a nih, a hung dân ang kawng tinrênga chun; chuong ang bawkin fêng a ta; a lungril sukrim saka a sininrimnaa chun ieng am hlâwkna a hmu leh?"

18,"Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be comely is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, wherein he laboreth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for this is his portion.","Ngai ta u, mi ta dinga ditum le ṭha âwma ka hmu chu, Pathienin ama a ipêk a dam sûng po poa, nisa hnuoia a sininrimna, a sininrimna po poa chun thil ṭha chu chên a, dâwna fâk hi a nih; chu chu ama chanpuol a ni sih a."
19,"Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God.","Mi tin Pathienin hausakna le neinungna a pêk a, chutaka fâk theina a pêk a, a sininrimnaa chun hlimna a pêk bawk a; hi hi Pathien thilthlâwnpêk a nih."
20,For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.,A dam sûng nihai po po chu hre zing nâwk si naw nih a; Pathien chun a lung lâwm zâwnga ama chu a dawn tâk leiin.
