1,"Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,","Chu lai tak chun, Jerusalema inthawkin Pharisaihai le Dân inchûktirtuhai Isu kuomah an hung a,"
2,Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.,"“Iengdinga i închûktirhaiin upa- hai thurosie chu an bawsiet hlak am a na? Bei an fâk pha kut an sâwp ngai si nawh a,” an ta."
3,"And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni khawm iengdinga in thu- rosie leia Pathien thupêk in bawsiet am a na?"
4,"For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.","Pathienin, ‘I nu le pa chawimawi rawh,’ ‘Tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih hrilse taphawt chu thi tei tei raw se,’ a ti sih a."
5,"But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given to God;","Nangni ruok chun tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih kuoma, ‘I mi sawrna ding hi Pathien kuoma pêk a ni tah, ti taphawt chun,"
6,he shall not honor his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.,"a nu amanih, a pa amanih a chawimawi ding a ni nawh’ in ti hlak a. Chuongchun, in thurosie leiin Pathien thu chu in baw hmang tah a ni hi."
7,"Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,",Vervêkhai Isai hin in chung- châng thu a lo hrillâwk indik ngei el:
8,This people honoreth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.,"‘Hi hairawi hin an bauin an mi chawimawi a, An lungril ruok chun an mi hlat sih a."
9,"But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, an inchûktirnaah mihriem thupêk an inchûktir leiin, An mi biek hlak hi a thlâwn el a nih,’ tiin,” a ta, a dawn a."
10,"And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:","Chun, mipui chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Ngai unla, a ngai lo thiem ro;"
11,"Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.","baua lût chu mihriem suk- thieng nawtu a ni nawh a, baua suok, achu ngei chu mihriem sukthieng nawtu a ni lem,” a ta."
12,"Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?","Chu lai chun, a inchûktirhai an hung a, a kuomah, “Pharisaihaiin kha thu kha an hriet a, an lungninaw kha i hriet am?” an ta."
13,"But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.","Ama ruok chun, “Kûng po po ka Pa vâna mi phun naw chu phâwi- dawkin um an tih."
14,"Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.","Anni chu pawisa naw ro; ṭhuoitu mitdel an nih. Chuongchun, mitdelin mitdel ma a ṭhuoi chun khurah tla rêl an tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
15,"And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.","Chun, Peterin a kuomah, “Tekhithu kha mi hrilfie ta la,” tiin a dawn a."
16,"And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?","Ama chun, “Tu chen hin nangni khawm hrietna nei loin in la um rawp maw?"
17,"Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?","Baua lût taphawt chu phîngah a tla thlah a, inhnawmnaah pei dawkin a um ti in hriet naw am a nih?"
18,But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.,Baua suokhai ruok chu lungrila hung suok a na; chuong ngei chun mihriem a sukthieng naw hlak a nih.
19,"For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:","Lungrila hin ngaituona suolhai, tuolthatna hai, uiretna hai, inditna hai, inrûkna hai, inhêkna hai, hrilsietna hai a hung suok hlak sih a."
20,these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.,"chuong chu mihriem suk- thieng nawtu a nih; kut sâwp loa bu fâk ruok chun mi a sukthieng naw nawh,” a ta."
21,"And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.","Chun, Isu chutaka inthawk chun a suok a; Tura le Sidon bielah a fe tah a."
22,"And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.","Chun, ngai ta, chuong rama in- thawk chun Kanaan nuhmei pakhat a hung suok a, “Lalpa, David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh, ka naunu khawhriin a man tlat a nih,” tiin a khêk a."
23,"But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.","Ama ruok chun bau khat khawmin a dawn nawh. Chun, a inchûktirhai chun, “Ei hnungah a khêk a khêk sih a, infetir el ta la,” tiin an hung ngên a."
24,"But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","Ama ruok chun, “Israel hnam laia berâm inhmang kuoma naw chu tir ka ni nawh,” a ta, a dawn a."
25,"But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.","Nisienlakhawm, nuhmei chu a hung a, “Lalpa, mi san rawh,” tiin chibai a bûk a."
26,"And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.","Chun, ama chun, “Nauhai bei lâkpêk a, uihai kuoma pêk chu a mawi nawh ie,” a ta, a dawn a."
27,"But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.","Ama chun, “Lalpa, ni chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, uihai khawmin an pu dawkâna inthawka bei nawi tla chu an fâk hlak annâwm,” a ta."
28,"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.","Chu phingleh Isûn a kuomah, “Nuhmei, i ringna a nasa êm el; i dit ang takin i chungah um raw se,” a ta, a dawn a. Chuongchun, a naunu chu, chu chena chun a hung dam el tah a."
29,"And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.","Chun, Isu chutaka inthawk chun a feh a, Galili dîl kâwl a hung tlung a; chun tlânga chun a hang feh a, chutaka chun a ṭhung tah a."
30,"And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them:","Chun, mipui nasatak, kebaihai, mitdelhai, ṭawngtheinawhai, pieng- suolhai hung ṭhuoiin a kuomah an hung a, a ke bulah an sieh a; chun, a lo sukdam tâwl a."
31,"insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.","Chuongchun, mipui chun, ṭawngtheinawhai chu hung ṭawng a, piengsuolhai chu hung ṭhah a, kebaihai chu kea lâwn a, mitdelhai chu hmu theia an hmuin, mak an ti hle a; chuongchun, Israelhai Pathien chu an inpâk tah a."
32,"And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.","Chun, Isûn a inchûktirhai chu a ko a, “Mipuihai hi tuhin ka kuomah ni thum an um tah a, fâk ding iengkhawm an nei naw leiin ka lungsiet bêk bêk a nih; bu ngheiin kân fetir nuom nawh ie, chuong naw chun lam kârah châu rawi an tih,” a ta."
33,"And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?","Chun, inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Mipui hieng zât zât khawpna khawp beiphêk chuong zât lâwm lâwm thlalêrah khâwlai am hmûng kan ta?” an ta."
34,"And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.","Chun, an kuomah, “Beiphêk iengzât am in nei a?” a ta. Anni chun, “Phêk sari, ngatê tlâwmte leh,” an ta."
35,And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;,Ama chun hnuoia ṭhung dingin mipui chu thu a pêk a.
36,"and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.","Chun, bei pasari le ngatê chu a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril a, a khawi a, inchûktirhai kuomah a pêk a; inchûktirhai chun mipuihai kuomah an pêk a."
37,"And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.","Chun, an rêngin an fâk a, an khawp tâwl tah a, an fâk mahla khawm chu bâwmrâng sari an rût sip a."
38,"And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.",A fatuhai chu nuhmei le nau- pang tiem loin patling ruok khawm sâng li an nih.
39,"And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.","Chun, mipuihai chu ân ṭintir hnungin lawngah a chuong a, Magadan ram a hung tlung a."
