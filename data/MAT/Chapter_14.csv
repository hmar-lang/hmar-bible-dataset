1,"At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,","Chu lai tak chun lal Herod chun Isu chanchin a lo hriet a,"
2,"and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him.","a siehlawhai kuomah, “Chu chu Baptistu Johan kha a ni chu, mithi laia inthawkin a tho nâwk tah a ni chu tie; chuleiin, chuong thilthaw- theinahai chun amaah sin a thaw a ni chu,” a ta."
3,"For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.","Herod chun a unaupa Philip nuhmei Herodi leiin Johan chu a man a; a khuop a, intângna inah a khum tah a na;"
4,"For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.","Johan chun a kuomah, “Ama i nei hi a thieng nawh,” a ti pêk leiin."
5,"And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.","Chun, Johan chu sukhlum a tum leh mipui a ṭih a, zâwlneiin an ruot si leiin."
6,"But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.","Nisienlakhawm, Herod pieng champhaphâk ni chu a hung tlungin Herodi naunu chu a laiah a lâm a, Herod chu a suklâwm tah a."
7,Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.,"Chuleichun, a ihni taphawt pe dingin inkhâmin ân tiem tah a."
8,"And she, being put forward by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.","Chun, ama chun a nu infuiin, “Hiva hin thlêngin Baptistu Johan lu mi pe rawh,” a ta."
9,"And the king was grieved; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be given;","Chun, lal chu a lungngai tah a; nisienlakhawm, a thutiem le a thlai- thlêng awtpuihai lei chun pêk ding thu a pêk a;"
10,and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.,"chuongchun, mi a tir a, intângna ina Johan lu chu ân tantir a."
11,"And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.","Chun, a lu chu thlêngin a hung lâk a, naupangnu kuoma chun an pêk a; ama chun a nu kuomah a fepui tah a."
12,"And his disciples came, and took up the corpse, and buried him; and they went and told Jesus.","Chun, a inchûktirhai chu an hung a, a ruong chu an inhlawm a, an phûm a; chun, an feh a, Isu an va hril tah a."
13,"Now when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from thence in a boat, to a desert place apart: and when the multitudes heard thereof, they followed him on foot from the cities.","Chun, Isûn chu chu a hrietin, chutaka inthawkin thlalêr hmun tieng lawngin a tumin a fe tah a. Nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chun an hriet phingleh khuoa inthawk dâm chun kea fein an zui tah a."
14,"And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.","Chuongchun, ama chu vapanga a suok chun, mipui nasatak a hmuh a; a lunginsiet bêk bêk a, an damnawhai a sukdam a,"
15,"And when even was come, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.","Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun, inchûktirhai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Ahi thlalêr hmun a na, an ta dinga fâk ding an inchâwk theina dingin mipuihai hi infetir ta la,” an ta."
16,"But Jesus said unto them, They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat.","Isu ruok chun an kuomah, “An fe hmang a ngai nawh ie; nangniin fâk ding pe ro,” a ta."
17,"And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Ahin beiphêk panga le nga pahni chau kan nei a nih,” an ta."
18,"And he said, Bring them hither to me.","Chun, ama chun, “Ahin ka kuomah hung la ro,” a ta."
19,"And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.","Chun, hlo chunga ṭhung dingin mipui chu thu a pêk a, beiphêk panga le nga pahni chu a lâk a, vân tieng enin mal a sâwm a, a khawi a, beiphêk panga chu inchûktirhai kuomah a pêk a; inchûktirhai chun mipui kuoma chun an pêk a."
20,"And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.","Chun, an rêngin an fâk a, an khawp tâwl tah a; an fâk mahla nawi khawm chu bâwm sâwm le pahni an rût sip a."
21,"And they that did eat were about five thousand men, besides women and children.",A fatuhai chu nuhmei le nau- pang tiem loin patling ruok khawm sâng nga rau an nih.
22,"And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away.","Chun, mipuihai chu ân ṭîntir vêl sûngin, a fe hmaa râlkhing tienga fe dingin inchûktirhai chu lawngah ân chuongtir hrâm nghâl tah a."
23,"And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone.","Chun, mipuihai chu ân ṭîntir hnungin ṭawngṭai dingin tlânga chun a tumin a hang feh a; chun, zântieng a hung ni chun ama chauin chutaka chun a um tah a."
24,"But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.",Lawng ruok chu dîl lailung takah a um tah a; thliin annaw tieng a mût leiin tuifâwnin a vawr tah a.
25,"And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.","Chun, vârṭien tâwmin dîl chunga kea lâwnin an kuom tieng a hung pan a."
26,"And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.","Inchûktirhai chun, ama chu dîl chunga kea lâwn an hang hmu chun, “Thla a ni saw,” tiin an thlaphâng a, an ṭih a, an khêk ta rak el a."
27,"But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn anni chu a biek nghâl tah a, “Lungmuongtakin um ro, kei ka ni annâwm, ṭi naw ro,” a ta."
28,"And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.","Chun, Peterin a dawn a, “Lalpa, nang i ni chun, tui chunga i kuoma hung thu mi pe rawh,” a ta."
29,"And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.","Ama chun, “Hung ta la,” a ta. Peter chu lawnga inthawk chun a ṭum a, Isu kuom tieng panin tui chunga chun kein a fe tah a."
30,"But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.","Nisienlakhawm, thli hrâng chu a hmuin a ṭih a; chun a tlum vâng vâng a, “Lalpa, mi sandam rawh” tiin a khêk tah a."
31,"And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?","Chun, Isûn a ban nghâl tah a, ama chu a chel a, a kuomah, “Nang ringna tlâwm, iengdinga i ringhla am a na?” a ta."
32,"And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.","Chun, lawngah an chuong chun thli chu a ma ta el a."
33,"And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.","Lawnga umhai chun, “Pathien Naupa i lo ni tak zet hi,” tiin chibai an bûk a."
34,"And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, unto Gennesaret.","Chun, râlkhing tieng an kai chun, Gennesaret ram khawmuol an tlung tah a."
35,"And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that were sick;","Chu hmuna mihai chun ama an hriet phingleh, chu kâwl vêl ram po poa chun mi an tir a, damnaw po po chu a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a;"
36,and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.,"chun, a puon hmawr bêk them thei an hnih a; chun, a them phawt chu an hung dam ta pei a."
