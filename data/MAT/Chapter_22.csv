1,"And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,","Chun, Isûn anni a biek a, an kuomah tekhithuin a hril nâwk a,"
2,"The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,","“Vân ram chu lal tu amanih, a naupa ta dinga inneina ruoiṭhena siem le chun tekhi a nih."
3,and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.,"Chun, inneina ruoiṭhe fa dinga a fielhai chu ko dingin a suokhai a tir a; nisienlakhawm, an hung nuom nawh a."
4,"Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.","Chun, ama chun, ‘Ka ifielhai kuoma khan, ngai ta u, ka ruoi chu kân zo tah; ka bâwngchalhai le ka ran châwm thauhai ka that a, iengkim inzo a ni tah, inneina ruoi fa dingin hung ta ro ti ro,’ tiin suok dang a tir nâwk a."
5,"But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;","Nisienlakhawm, an lo ngaisak nawh a, an fe hmang el ta a, pakhat chu loah a feh a, pakhat chu sum- dâwngnaah,"
6,"and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.","mi danghai chun a suokhai chu an man a, inzakumtakin an siem a, an sukhlum el tah a."
7,"But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.","Chuongchun, lal chu a lunginsen tah a; a sipaihai a tir a, chuong tuolthathai chu a sukbo a, an khuo khawm a rawpêk tah a."
8,"Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.","“Chun, a suokhai kuoma chun, ‘Inneina ruoi inzo a ni tah; fielhai ruok kha chu fa tlâk an ni nawh."
9,"Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.","Chuongchun, lampêt ṭhuom- haiah fe unla, mi in hmu taphawt inneina ruoi fa dingin fiel ro,’ a ta."
10,"And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.","Chuongchun, chu suokhai chu an suok a, lampuihaia chun an va feh a, an hmu taphawt, mi suol le mi ṭhahai khawm an ṭhuoi khâwm ta vawng a; chuongchun, inneina ruoi pindan chu mi fiel haiin an lo sip tah a."
11,"But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment:","“Nisienlakhawm, lal chu mi fielhai en dinga a hung lût chun, inneina puon sil lo mi pakhat chutaka chun a hmuh a."
12,"and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.","Chuongchun, a kuomah, ‘Ruola, iengtizie am a na, inneina puon boin hitaka hin i hung lût el a?’ a ta. Chun, ama chu a to zing a."
13,"Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.","Chun, lal chun a suokhai kuomah, ‘A kut le a ke khuop unla, tuol tieng inthimah pei dawk ro, chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih,’” a ta."
14,"For many are called, but few chosen.","“Fielhai chu tamtak an na, thlang hai ruok chu tlâwmte an nih” a ta."
15,"Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in his talk.","Chu lai chun, Pharisaihai chun a thu hrila an man theina zie ding an vân râwn a,"
16,"And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.","Chun, an inchûktirhai, Herod pâwla mihai leh an tir a; chuonghai chun, “Inchûktirtu, mi indiktak i na, titakzetin Pathien thu kawng în chûktir hlak a, pawisak bîk tukhawm i nei nawh ti kan hriet a; tukhawm thlierbîk i nei si nawh a."
17,"Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?","Chuongchun, ieng angin am i ngai a? mi hril raw khai! Kaisar kuomah sie chawi hi a thieng am, a thieng naw?” an ta."
18,"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn an suolzie chu a lo hriet a, “Vervêkhai, ieng dinga in mi fie?"
19,Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a denarius.,"Sie tangka chu mîn entir ro,” a ta. Chun, a kuomah duli an hung lâk a."
20,"And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hi hi tu lim le tu hming am a na?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Kaisar,” an ta."
21,"They say unto him, Cæsar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “A ni sa chun, Kaisar thilhai chu Kaisar kuomah pe unla, Pathien thilhai chu Pathien kuomah pe ta unla,” a ta."
22,"And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.","Chuong thu chu an hrietin mak an ti hle a, ama an mâksan a, an fe ta dai a."
23,"On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,","Chu ni ma chun, Saddukaihai, thonâwkna a um nawh tituhai chu a kuomah an hung a,"
24,"saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.","a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, Mosie- in, ‘Mi nau nei loa a thi chun, a unaupain a nuhmei chu neiin, a unaupa ta dingin chi a thlapêk ding a nih,’ a ta."
25,"Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother;","Âwle, keini lai sal sari an um a; a upa takin nuhmei a nei a, a thi a; chun, suon a nei naw leiin a nuhmei chu a unaupa ihluo dingin a mâksan a;"
26,"in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.","chuongang bawkin a pahnina leh, a pathumna leh, a pasarina chenin an hluo seng a."
27,"And after them all, the woman died.","Chun, an rênga an thi hnung chun nuhmei khawm chu a thi tah a."
28,In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.,"Chuongchun, thonâwk pha chun pasarihai lai chun atu nuhmei tak am nîng a ta? an rêngin an nei sih a,” tiin an indawn a."
29,"But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.","Isûn a dawn a, an kuomah, “Pathien Lekha thu le, Pathien thil- thawtheina in hriet naw leiin in ngai suol hlak a nih."
30,"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.","Thonâwknaah nuhmei pasal innei ta naw ni hai a, vâna vântir- kohai ang an ni ta lem ding a nih in sawnnaw."
31,"But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,","Chun, mithi thonâwkna thua Pathienin in kâwla hienga a hril kha in tiem naw am a nih?"
32,"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.","‘Kei Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien, Jakob Pathien ka nih,’ tiin Pathien chu mithi Pathien a ni nawh a, mi hring Pathien a ni lem,” a ta."
33,"And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.","Chun, mipuihai chun chu chu an hrietin, a thu inchûktir chu mak an ti hle a."
34,"But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.","Pharisaihai ruok chun, Isûn Saddukaihai a sêldawng ti an hrietin an inkhâwm tah a."
35,"And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him:","Chun, anni laia mi pakhat dânhretu hin ama fiena dingin,"
36,"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?","“Inchûktirtu, Dân thua chun ieng thupêk am a ropuitak a?” tiin ân dawn a."
37,"And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “ ‘Lalpa I Pathien chu I lungvar po poin, i thlarau po poin, i lungril po poin i hmangai ding a nih,’ ti hi."
38,This is the great and first commandment.,Chu chu thupêk ropui le pawimaw tak a nih.
39,"And a second like unto it is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.","Chun, a dawttu, a în angpui chu hi hi a nih, ‘Nangma în hmangai angin i vênghai khawm i hmangai ding a nih,’ ti hi."
40,"On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.","Hieng thupêk pahnia hin Dân thu le zâwlneihai thu po po ân khaikhâwm vawng a nih,” a ta."
41,"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,","Chun, Pharisaihai chu an inkhâwm lai chun, Isûn anni chu thu ân dawn a,"
42,"saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.","“Krista chu ieng angin am in ngai a, tu naupa am a na?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “David naupa,” an ta."
43,"He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ieng- tiziein am David chun Thlarauin ‘Lalpa’ tiin,"
44,"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?","‘Lalpa chun ka Lalpa kuomah, Ka chang tieng ṭhung rawh; I hmêlmahai i kepha hnuoia ka sie hmakhat chu,’ a tih a? a ta."
45,"If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?","“David chun ama chu, ‘Lalpa,’ a ti si chun iengtin am a naupa ni thei a ta?” a ta."
46,"And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.","Chun, tukhawmin bau khat khawma an dawn thei ta nawh a; chu ni chena inthawk chu tukhawmin thu dang hrim hrim khawma an indawn ngam ta nawh."
