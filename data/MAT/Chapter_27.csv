1,"Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:","Chun, zîngkâr a hung ni chun, thiempu lalhai le vântlâng upahai po po chu Isu sukhlum dingin a chungthuah an inrâwn a;"
2,"and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.","chun, an khuop a, an ṭhuoi a, Bawrsâp Pilat kuomah an pêk tah a."
3,"Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,","Chun, Juda ân mantîrtu khan Isu thiemnaw an inchangtir ti a hriet phingleh ân sîr a; tangka sâwmthum kha thiempu lalhai kuoma chun a hung chawi nâwk a,"
4,"saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou to it.","“Mi thiem thisen kân mantir kha thil ka suksuol a nih,” a ta. Anni ruok chun, “Chu chu kan ta dingin ieng am pawi a ta? Nangin i thaw thawin thaw rawh,” an ti san a."
5,"And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.","Chun, ama chun tangka chu hmun inthienga chun a pei lût a; a fe hmang a, a vân âwkhlum tah a."
6,"And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.","Chun, thiempu lalhai chun tangka chu an lâk a, “Hi hi thawlâwm bâwma sie a thieng nawh ie, thisen man a ni sih a,” an ta."
7,"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.","Chuongchun, an inrâwn a, mikhuolhai phûmna dingin bêlhemtu hmun chu an inchâwk tah a."
8,"Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.","Chu lei chun a nih, chu hmun chu tu chena, “Thisen Hmun,” an ti chu."
9,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom certain of the children of Israel did price;","Chu lai chun, zâwlnei Jeremiain hieng thu a hril hi a hung tlung tah a: “Chun, tangka sâwmthum, An isak man, Israel thla tuhaiin amanih an isak man chu, An lâk a;"
10,"and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.","Lalpain a mi tiem angin, Belhemtu hmun man dingin an pêk a,” ti hi."
11,"Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.","Chun, Isu chu Bawrsâp hmaa chun a ngîr a. Chun, Bawrsâp chun, “Judahai lal i ni?” tîn ân dawn a. Chun, Isûn, “I hril ang chun ka nih,” a ta."
12,"And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le upa- haiin an hêk laiin iengkhawmin a dawn nawh a."
13,"Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?","Chuongchun, Pilatin a kuomah, “An hêkna zozai che hi i hriet naw am a nih?” a ta."
14,"And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.","Chun, bau khat khawmin a dawn nawh a; chuongchun, Bawrsâp chun mak a ti hleh a."
15,"Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.","Chun, Bawrsâpin ruoiṭhe ni chun, mi intâng pakhat an dit taphawt mipuihai chu ân suopêk hlak a."
16,"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.","Chun, chu lai chun, mi intâng hming inthangtak Barabba an ti chu an nei a."
17,"When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?","Chuongchun, an hung inkhâwm chun, Pilatin an kuomah “Tu am in- suopêk lang cheu in nuom a? Barabba am, Isu, Krista an ti chu?” a ta."
18,For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.,Thîkna leiin ama chu an inmantir ti a hriet sih a.
19,"And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.","Chun, rorêlna ṭhungphaa ân ṭhung lai chun, a nuhmeiin, “Kha mi feltak chunga khan iengkhawm thaw naw rawh; vawisûn hin ama leiin mangah thil tamtak ka tuor a nih,” tiin ân chah a."
20,"Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le upa- haiin Barabba hnia, Isu sukhlum dingin mipuihai chu an thlêm a."
21,"But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.","Bawrsâp ruok chun anni chu a biek a, “Anni pahni chu a tu lem am insuopêk lang cheu in nuom a?” a ti nâwk a. Anni chun, “Barabba” an tih a."
22,"Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.","Pilatin an kuomah, “Isu, Krista an ti hi iengtin am thâwng ka ti leh?” a ta. An rêngin, “Krawsah inhemdêtir rawh,” an tih a."
23,"And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.","Chun, ama chun, “Iengdingin am ie? Ieng am a suksuol leh?” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, anni rawi chun “Krawsah inhemdêtir rawh,” tiin an khêk rak rak a."
24,"So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye to it.","Chuongchun, Pilatin ieng- khawm thaw thei loa buoi tieu tieu ding a nih ti a hrietin, tui a lâk a, mipui hmaa chun a kut a sâwp a, “Hi mi fel thisena hin kân thieng; nang- nîn in thaw thawin thaw ro,” a ta."
25,"And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.","Chun, vântlâng po po chun, “A thisen chu keini chunga le, kan nauhai chungah um raw se,” tiin an dawn a."
26,Then released he unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.,"Chu zoa chun Barabba chu ân suopêk tah a; Isu ruok chu a vuok a, krawsa hemde dingin a pêk tah a."
27,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Prætorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.","Chu zoa chun, Bawrsâp sipaihai chun Isu chu lal inah an ṭhuoi lût a, an pâwla mi po po a kuomah an ko khâwm a."
28,"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.","Chuongchun, a puonhai dâm an hlîppêk a, puon sen an insiltir a."
29,"And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!","Chun, hling lukhum an phier a, an inkhumtir a, a kut changtieng luong an inchawitir a; a hmaah an dingṭhaṭhuon a, “Chibai, Judahai lal,” tiin nuiza siemnain an hmang a."
30,"And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.","Chun, chil an sâk khum a, luong chu an lâkpêk a, a lua chun an vuok a."
31,"And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.","Chun, nuiza siemnaa an hmang zoin, puon chu an hlîppêk a, ama puonhai chu an insiltir nâwk a; krawsa hemde dingin an ṭhuoi tah a."
32,"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go with them, that he might bear his cross.","Chun, an fe suok laiin Kurini khuoa mi, a hming Simon an hmuh a; chu mipa chu a kraws put dingin an man a."
33,"And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,","Chun, Golgotha an ti hmun an hung tlung a, (chu chu, “Luru hmun,” tina a nih)"
34,"they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.","uoin thûr, thil kha le pawl, a dâwn dingin an pêk a, nisienla- khawm ân tem phingin a dâwn nuom ta nawh a."
35,"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;","Chun, krawsah an hemde zoin, aisânin a silfênhai chu an insem a."
36,and they sat and watched him there.,"Chun, chutaka chun an ṭhung a, an vêng a, a hêkna —"
37,"And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.","“HI MIPA HI ISU JUDAHAI LAL A NIH,” tia ziek a lu chungah an bel a."
38,"Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.","Chun, ama ruol chun, suom- hmang pahni an hemde veh a, a changtieng pakhat a vawitieng pakhat."
39,"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,","Chun, mi inlawn taphawt chun an lu thinin, an tiel a,"
40,"and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.","“Nang Pathien biekin ṭhiek a, ni thuma bâwl nâwktu, insukdam rawh, Pathien Naupa i ni chun, krawsa kha hung ṭum ta la,” tiin."
41,"In like manner also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,","Chuong ang bawkin thiempu lalhai chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai le upahai leh tielin,"
42,"He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.","“Mi dang hman a sukdam hlak a; ama le ama ân sukdam thei si nawh a. Israel lal a nih annâwm, tuhin krawsa inthawkin hung ṭum ta sien la, chuongchun, ama awi nâwm ei ni!"
43,"He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.","Pathien a awi annâwm, ama hi a nuom chun tuhin sandam raw se, ‘Pathien Naupa ka nih,’ a ti sih a,” an ta."
44,And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.,"Suomhmang an hemde vehai khawm chun, chuong ang bawkin an ti el veh a."
45,Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.,"Chun, nisa indinga inthawka zânbu suong pha chenin khawvêl a hung inthim ta vawng a."
46,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?","Chun, zânbu suong pha vêl chun, Isu chu râwl inringtakin, “Eli, Eli lama sabakthani” tiin a khêk suok a. (Chu chu, “Ka Pathien, ka Pathien, iengdinga i mi mâksan?” tina a nih.)"
47,"And some of them that stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.","Chun, a kâwla ngîr ṭhenkhathai chun chu chu an hrietin, “Hi mipa hin Elija a ko a nih,” an ta."
48,"And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.","Chun, an laia mi pakhat a tlân nghâl tah a, sponj a lâk a, uoin thûr ân chie sip a, hmawlah a târ a, a hang indâwntir a."
49,"And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.","Chun, mi danghai chun, “Um raw se, ama la dingin Elija a hung am en ei tiu,” an ta."
50,"And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.","Chun, Isu chu râwl inringtakin a khêk nâwk a, a thlarau ân thla tah a."
51,"And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;","Chun, ngai ta, Pathien biekina puonzâr chu a chung tienga in- thawkin a hnuoi tieng chenin, a lo tlêr suok tah a; chun, simkhawleihnuoi dâm ân hnîng a, lungpuihai an hung kawi a;"
52,and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;,thlânhai an hung inhawng a; mi inthieng in tahai taksa tamtak khawm keithoin an um tah a;
53,and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.,"chuonghai chu a thonâwk hnunga chun, thlâna inthawka hung suokin khaw inthienga chun an lût a, mi tamtak kuomah an inlâr tah a."
54,"Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.","Chun, sipai za hotu le a kuoma Isu vênga um vehai chun, simkhaw- leihnuoi inhnîng le thil umziehai chu an hmu chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk a, “Hi mipa hi Pathien Naupa a ni ngei el,” an ta."
55,"And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:","Chun, chutaka chun nuhmei tamtak, a rawngbâwlpêk pum peia Galili rama inthawka Isu hung zuituhai chu an um a; hlatakah an thlîr a;"
56,"among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.","chuonghai lai chun Mari Magdalin hai, Mari, Jakob le Josef nu hai, Zebedai naupahai nuhai rawi an ṭhang a."
57,"And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:","Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun, mi hausa, a hming Josef, Arimathaia mi a hung a, ama ngei khawm chu Isu inchûktir a ni bawk a."
58,"this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.","Chu mipa chu Pilat kuomah a va feh a; Isu ruong chu a hnih a. Chun, Pilatin pêk din gin thu a pêk a."
59,"And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,","Chuongchun, Josef chun ruong chu a lâk a, puon zai inhmi fâitakin a tuom a;"
60,"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.","ama thlân thar, lung a iverkuoa chun ân zâl a, thlân kawtkhâr chu lung lientakin ân del a, a fe tah a."
61,"And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.","Chun, chutaka chun, Mari Magdalin le Mari dang chu an um a, thlân hma zâwna chun an ṭhung a."
62,"Now on the morrow, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,","Chun, a zînga chun (chu chu Inringlâwk ni zo tûk a nih) thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai chu Pilat kuomah an um khâwm dup a,"
63,"saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.","“Pu, chu hlêmtu chun, a dam lai khan ‘Ni thum chenah thonâwk ka tih,’ a ti kan hriet zing a."
64,"Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.","Chuongchun, thlân chu ni thum ni chen vêng ṭha dingin thu pe rawh, chuong naw chun a inchûktirhai chu hungin, ama chu inru hlau an ta, vântlâng kuomah, ‘Mithi laia in- thawkin a thonâwk ta a nih,’ ti rawi an tih; chuongchun, hlêmna nuhnung lem chu a hmasa nêk khan ṭha naw nâwk zuol a tih,” an ta."
65,"Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it as sure as ye can.","Pilatin an kuomah, “Vêngtu sipaihai in nei annâwm, fe unla in thei ang angin invêngṭhattir ta unla,” a ta."
66,"So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.","Chuongchun, vêngtu sipaihai leh an feh a, thlân chu an invêng ṭhattir a, lung chu an inchik a."
