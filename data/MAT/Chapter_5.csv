1,"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him:","Chuongchun, mipuihai chu a hmuin tlângah a lâwn a; chun, a ṭhung a, a inchûktirhai a kuomah an hung a;"
2,"and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,","chuongchun, thu a hril a, anni ân chuktir a:"

11,"Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.","“Miin keima leia an hal cheu a, an suknawmna cheu a; khêla suol tinrêngin an hêk pha cheu, in la hamṭha ding a nih."
12,"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you.","“Lâwm unla, nasatakin hlim ro; vânah in lâwmman a um râwn sih a; chuong ang bawkin in hmaa zâwlnei umhai khawm an suknawmna hlak kha."
13,"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.","“Hnuoi machi in nih; nisien- lakhawm, machi hi a da ta chun iengin am sukal nâwk an ta? Peihâwna, mihriemhai sir mei mei ding chau naw chun, ienga ding khawmin a ṭha ta nawh."
14,Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.,“Khawvêl var in nih. Tlâng sîpa khaw um chu thuphmang thei a ni nawh.
15,"Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house.","Mîn khâwnvar sitin leikhâwr hnuoiah an sie ngai nawh; a sienaah an sie lem hlak; chuongchun, in sûnga mi po po a ên hlak."
16,"Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.","Chuong ang bawkin in var chu mi mithmuah var raw se; chuong- chun, in thilthaw ṭhathai hmûng an ta, in Pa vâna mi chawimawi thei an tih."
17,"Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.","“Dân thu amanih, zâwlneihai thu amanih sukbo dinga hung ka ni ring naw ro, sukbo dinga hung ka ni nawh a, sukkim dinga hung ka ni lem."
18,"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hnuoi le vân hi a bo hmakhat chun Dân thua sunhâng chite amanih, thai- hâng chite amanih, pakhat khawm, bo naw tawp a tih, a rênga a tlung kim hmakhat chun."
19,"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","Chuongchun, tukhawm hieng thupêk laia pakhat, a chîntak khawm bawsea, chuonga thaw ve dinga mihai inchûktir taphawt chu, vân rama chun mi chîn tak tîng an tih; ami- ruokchu, tukhawm zâwma inchûktir taphawt chu, vân rama chun mi lien tîng an tih."
20,"For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.",In felnain Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisaihai felna a khûm naw chun vân ramah lût naw tawp in tih ti ka hril cheu a ni hi.
21,"Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:","“Tienlaia mihai kuoma chun, ‘tuol i that ding a ni nawh,’ ti le, ‘tukhawm tuolthat chu rorêlna hmabâk zingin um a tih’ an tih ti in hriet tah;"
22,"but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.","kei ruok chun, tukhawm a unau chunga lunginsen taphawt chu rorêlna hmabâk zingin um a tih; chun tukhawm a unau kuoma, ‘Hmang- nabopa’ ti taphawt chu rorêlna hma- bâk zingin um a tih; chun tukhawm, ‘Invêtpa’ ti taphawt chu Hremhmun meia pei hmabâk zingin um a tih ti ka hril cheu hi."
23,"If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,","Chuongchun, mâichâm bula i thilpêk în hlân lai taka, i unauin i chungah lungninawna a nei ti i hriet dawk nâwk chun,"
24,"leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.","chutaka mâichâm hmaa chun i thilpêk chu mâksan la, fe la, i unau rem zet la, chu hnunga chun i thilpêk chu inhlân rawh."
25,"Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.","I khingpui chu lampuia in intlawn laiin rem vat rawh; chuong naw chun, i khingpui chun rorêltu inmantir a ti cheh a, rorêltu chun mi man hotu kuomah pêng a ti cheh a, intângna inah khum hlau rawi an ti che."
26,"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing.","Titakzetin ka hril che hi, pawisa khat chena i pêk kim nek hma chun, chutaka inthawk chun suok naw tawp i tih."
27,"Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:","“ ‘I uire ding a ni nawh,’ an tih ti in hriet tah."
28,"but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.","Kei ruok chun, tukhawm nu- hmei dit ena en taphawt chun, a lungrilah a uire zing a nih ti ka hril cheu hi."
29,"And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.","Chun, i mit changtiengin a sukthlûk che chun khel dawk la, pei dai rawh; i taksa a puma Hrem- hmuna peia a um nêkin, i taksa pêng pakhat bo chu i ta dingin a ṭha lem a nih."
30,"And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell.","I kut changtiengin a sukthlûk che chun, tan la, pei dai rawh; i taksa a puma Hremhmuna peia a um nêk chun, i taksa pêng pakhat a bo chu i ta dingin a ṭha lem a nih."
31,"It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:","“Chun, ‘Tukhawm nuhmei ma chun inmâkna lekha a kuomah pe raw se,’ an ti bawk a."
32,"but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.","Kei ruok chun, tukhawm tlangvâl dit lei ni loa mâni nuhmei ma taphawt chun, ama chu ân uirettir a nih; tukhawm mâk hnung chu nei taphawt chu a uire a nih ti ka hril cheu hi."
33,"Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:","“Tienlaia mihai kuoma chun, ‘Khêlin inkhâm naw la, Lalpa kuomah în khâmna chu hlen lem rawh,’ an tih ti in hriet ta bawk a."
34,"but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;","Kei ruok chun ka ti cheu hi, vânni hrim hrim khâm naw ro, vân sâlin amanih inkhâm naw ro, achu Pathien Lalṭhungpha a ni sih a; hnuoi sâl khawmin inkhâm naw ro, achu a ke innghatna a ni sih a;"
35,"nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.","Jerusalem sâlin inkhâm bawk naw ro, achu lal ropuitak khawpui a ni sih a."
36,"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.","I lu sâlin în khâm ding a ni bawk nawh a, samzai pakhat khawm i sukvârin, i sukdum thei si nawh a."
37,"But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one.","‘A nih,’ in ti chu ‘a nih,’ ni sienla, ‘A ni nawh’ in ti chu ‘a ni nawh’ ni el raw se, chuonghai bâk chu suola inthawka suok a nih."
38,"Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:","“ ‘Mit sikah mit, ha sikin ha,’ an tih ti in hriet tah."
39,"but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.","Kei ruok chun ka hril cheu hi, mi suol khing naw ro. I bieng changtienga ben taphawt che chu a khing tieng khawm dawpêk lem rawh."
40,"And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.","Tukhawmin i kuomah thupawi siemin, i zakuo lâk a tum chun, i puon khawm inlâktir nghâl rawh."
41,"And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.",Mêl khat fe dinga phût luitu taphawt che kuoma chun mêl hni fe rawh.
42,"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.","A hnitu che kuoma chun pe la, i kuoma pûk nuomtu chu nghatsan naw."
43,"Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy:","“ ‘I vênghai hmangai la, i hmêl- ma theida rawh,’ an tih ti in hriet tah."
44,"but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;","Kei ruok chun ka hril cheu hi, in hmêlmahai chu hmangai unla; a suk- nawmnatuhai cheu chu ṭawngṭai- pêk ro;"
45,"that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.","in Pa vâna mi nauhai in ni theina dingin; ama chun mi suolhai le mi ṭhahai chunga chun a nisa ân suoktir a, mi fel le mi fel nawhai chunga khawm ruo ân sûrtir hlak a nih."
46,"For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?",A hmangaituhai cheu chau in lunginsiet hin lâwmman ieng am hmûng in ta? Siedâwltuhai khawmin chuong angin an thaw ve a ni naw am a nih?
47,"And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same?","chun, in unauhai chau chibai in bûk hin a ieng am in thaw tam bik a? Jentailhai khawmin chuong angin an thaw ve a ni naw am a nih?"
48,"Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.","Chuongchun, in Pa vâna mi a ṭhafamkim angin in ṭhafamkim ding a nih."
