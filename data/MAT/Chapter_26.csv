1,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,","Chun, Isûn chuong thu po po chu a hril zoin, a închûktir hai kuomah,"
2,"Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.","“Ni hni chenah Fekân ruoi a hung um ding a nih ti in hriet a, Mihriem Naupa hi hemde dingin an inmantir ding a nih,” a ta."
3,"Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas;","Chu lai chun, Thiempu laltak Kaiapha an ti in inhuon sûnga chun thiempu lalhai le vântlâng upahai an inkhâwm a;"
4,"and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.","Isu chu zâwra mana, an sukhlum theina dingin an inrâwn a."
5,"But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.","Nisienlakhawm, “Ruoiṭhe sûng chu ni naw sien la, chuong naw chun vântlâng lai buoina hung um rawi a tih,” an ta."
6,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,","Chun, Isu Bethaniah inphâr Simon inah a um lai chun,"
7,"there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.","nuhmei pakhat alabastar bûra hriek rim inhnik totak chawiin a kuomah a hung a, a buthlêng awt laiin a luah a buok a."
8,"But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?","Nisienlakhawm, inchûktirhaiin chu chu an hmu chun an lunginsen a."
9,"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.","“Iengdinga hienga a sukhmang- thai mei mei am a na? Hi hriek hi man tamtaka zawra, pasiehai kuoma pêk thei a ni sih a,” an ta."
10,"But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.","Isu ruok chun chu chu a hrietin an kuomah, “Nuhmei hi iengdinga in sukbuoi am a na? Ka chunga hin thil ṭhatak a thaw a nih."
11,For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.,"Pasiehai chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um an nih annâwm, kei ruok chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um ding ka ni nawh."
12,"For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.","Hi hriek rim inhnik ka taksaa a ibuok hi, phûm dinga mi buotsai dingin a thaw a ni hi."
13,"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, khawvêl po poah khâwlai khawm hi Chanchin Ṭha hi an hrilna poah, hi nuhmei thil thaw khawm hi ama hriet zingna dingin hril ve pei an tih,” a ta."
14,"Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,","Chu hnunga chun sâwm le pahni laia mi pakhat, Juda Iskariot an ti chu, thiempu lalhai kuomah a fe a,"
15,"and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.","“Ama chu inmantir ka ti cheu a ieng am mi pêng in ta?” a ta. Chun, tangka sâwmthum an bûkpêk tah a."
16,And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him unto them.,Chu chena inthawk chun in- mantirna remchâng a zawng tah a.
17,"Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?","Chun, Chawlṭhanglo Bei Ruoi- ṭhe ni, ni hmasataka chun, inchûk- tirhai chu Isu kuomah an hung a, “Fekân ruoi bu fâkna dingin khâwlai am buotsai pêk inlang che i nuom a?” an ta."
18,"And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.","Ama chun, “Khawpuiah tu amani kuomah fe unla, a kuomah, ‘Inchûktirtu chun, ka hun a hnai tah a; ka închûktirhai leh Fekân ruoi i inah ṭhêng kan tih, a tih,’ va ti ro,” a ta."
19,And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.,"Chun, Isûn an kuoma a ti ang chun inchûktirhai chun an thaw a, Fekân ruoi ding chu an buotsai tah a."
20,"Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;","Chun, khuo a hung inhnu chun, inchûktir sâwm le pahnihai leh buthlêng an awt a;"
21,"and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.","chun, an fâk laiin ama chun, “Titakzetin ka ti cheu hi, in laia mi pakhat hin mîn mantir a tih,” a ta."
22,"And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?","Chun, an lungngai ta bêk bêk a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, kei am ka nih?” an ti ta seng a."
23,"And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.","Ama chun, “Thlênga mi purpui- tu ngei chun mîn mantir a tih."
24,"The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.","Mihriem Naupa hi a chanchin an ziek angtak khan a fe ding a nih, nisienlakhawm, Mihriem Naupa inman- tirtu ding mipa chung chu a rik! chu mihriem chu insieng naw sien la, a ta dingin ṭha lem a tih,” tiin a dawn a."
25,"And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.","Chun, ân mantirtu ding Juda chun a dawn a, “Rabbi, kei am ka nih?” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “în ti zing chu teh,” a ta."
26,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.","Chun, an fâk laiin Isûn bei a lâk a, mal a sâwmpêk a, a khawi a; chun, inchûktirhai kuomah a pêk a, “La unla, fa ro, hi hi ka taksa a nih,” a ta."
27,"And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;","Chun, no a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril a, an kuomah a pêk a, “In rêngin dâwn ro;"
28,"for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.","hi hi ka thisen, suolhai ngai- damna dinga mi tamtak ta dinga suok ding, thuthlungna chu a nih"
29,"But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.","Nisienlakhawm, ka hril cheu hi, ka Pa rama nangni le a thar ka dâwn ni a tlung hmakhat chun tuta inthawkin grêp hrui raa hi dâwn nâwk ta naw ning,” a ta."
30,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.","Chun, hla an sak zoin an suok a, Oliv tlânga chun an fe tah a."
31,"Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Vawizân hin in rêngin ka chung- thuah lungnilovin um vawng in tih, ‘Berâm vêngtu chu vuong ka ta, berâm ruol chu indar an tih,’ ti ziek a ni sih a."
32,"But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.","Nisienlakhawm, ka thonâwk hnungin Galili ramah in hmaah fêng ka tih,” a ta."
33,"But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.","Peter ruok chun a kuomah, “An rêngin i chungthuah lungnilovin um- hai sien khawm, kei chu lungnilovin um nâw tawp ka tih,” tiin a dawn a."
34,"Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.","Isûn a kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril che, vawizân hin âr a khuong hmain, nangin vawithum mîn phat i tih,” a ta."
35,"Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.","Peterin a kuomah, “I thinaa chun thi ve ding ni lang khawm inphat naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta. Chuong ang bawk chun, inchûktirhai po po chun an ti ta seng a."
36,"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.","Chu zoa chun Isu annihai le chun, hmun pakhat Gethsemane an ti chu an tlung a, chun, ama chun a închûktirhai kuomah, “Sawtaka ka va ṭawngṭai sûng po hitaka hin lo ṭhung ro,” a ta."
37,"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.","Chun, Peter le Zebedai nauhai pahni chu a ṭhuoi a, a lungngaiin a lunginzîng ta bêk bêk a."
38,"Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.","Chun, an kuomah, “Ka lungril a lungngai bêk bêk a; thina khawp rau a nih. Hitaka hin um unla mi vêngpui ro,” a ta."
39,"And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.","Chun, tlâwmtên hma tieng a va fe dep a, a bawkkhup a, “Aw Pa, a thei chun, hi no hin mi khêl hrâm raw se; nisienlakhawm, keima thu ni loin, nangma thu thu ni lem raw se,” tiin a ṭawngṭai a."
40,"And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?","Chun, inchûktirhai kuoma chun a hung a, anni chu inin a hung hmuh a, Peter kuomah, “E khai! nangnîn dârkâr khat khawm in mi vêngpui thei naw a ni maw?"
41,"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.","Thlêmnaa in lût nawna dingin inring zingin ṭawngṭai ro; thlarau chun chu a pei a, tisa ruok chu a hrât naw a nih,” a ta."
42,"Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.","Chun, vawi hninaah a va feh a, a ṭawngṭai nâwk a, “Aw Pa, ka dâwn loa hi no hin a mi khêl thei lul naw chun, nangma thu thu ni raw se,” a ta."
43,"And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.","Chun, a hung nâwk a, anni chu inin a hung hmu nâwk a, an îmu a suok hle sih a."
44,"And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.","Chun, a fe san nâwk a, a vawi thumnaah a thu hril ngai hrilin a ṭawngṭai nâwk a."
45,"Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Chu zoa chun, inchûktirhai kuomah a hung nâwk a, an kuomah, “Tuhin chu in unla châwl ta ro! Ngai ta u; a hun chu a hung tlung tah a, Mihriem Naupa hi mi suolhai kutah an inmantir ding a ni hi."
46,"Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.","Tho unla, fêng ei tiu, a mîn mantirtu ding chu a hung hnai ta hi,” a ta."
47,"And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.","Chun, a la hril lai zingin Juda, sâwmpahni hai laia mi pakhat chu, a hung tlung tah a, ama ruol chun thiempu lalhai le upahai kuoma inthawkin mipui nasatak, kâwlhnâm le hembâwk chawiin an hung tlung bawk a."
48,"Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.","Chun, ân mantirtu ding chun inchikna ding a lo hrillâwk hieu a, “Ka ifâwp taphawt chu ama nîng a tih, man el ro,” tiin."
49,"And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.","Chuongchun, Isu chu a va pan nghâl tah a. “Chibai, Rabbi,” tiin a fâwp ta ngâwi ngâwi a."
50,"And Jesus said unto him, Friend, do that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “Ruola, i hungna san chu thaw rawh,” a ta. Chu phingleh Isu chu an chel a, an man tah a."
51,"And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.","Chun, ngai ta, Isu rawihai laia pakhat chun a kutin a ban a, a kâwl- hnâm a phawi a, Thiempu Laltak suok chu a sât a; a nakâwr a sât thlâkpêk a."
52,"Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.","Chun, Isûn a kuomah, “I kâwl- hnâm kha a sienaah sie nâwk rawh, kâwlhnâm ruoituhai po po chu kâwlhnâm bawkin an thi ding a ni sih a."
53,"Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?",Tukhawm hin vântirko sâng ruk hmun sâwm le hmun hni nêka tam lem mi hung tirpêk dingin ka Pa kuomah ngên thei naw dingin in mi ring am a nih?
54,"How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?","Nisienlakhawm, ngên ang lang, iengtin am Pathien Lekha Thu-hieng anga hung um ding thu hi-tlung thei a ti leh?” a ta."
55,"In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.","Chu lai chun, Isûn mipuihai kuoma chun, “Kâwlhnâmhai, hem- bâwkhai châwiin suomhmang man ding ang elin a mi man dingin in hung suok a ni maw? Pathien biekinah ni tin inchûktirin ka ṭhung hlak a, in mi man si nawh a."
56,"But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.","Nisienlakhawm, zâwlnei lekha thuhai a tlung theina dingin hieng po po hi a hung tlung tah a ni hi,” a ta. Chu lai chun, inchûktirhai po po chun ama an thlathlam a, an tlân hmang ta vawng a."
57,"And they that had taken Jesus led him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.","Chun, Isu mantuhai chun, Thiempu Laltak Kaiapha ina Dân Inchûktirtuhai le upahai um khâwmnaa chun ama chu an ṭhuoi tah a."
58,"But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin hla- taka inthawkin ama chu a zui a, Thiempu laltak in inhuonna sûng tuol chenin; chun, a va lût a, a tâwpna hmu dingin siehlawhai lai chun a ṭhung ve a."
59,"Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;","Chun, ama an sukhlum theina dingin thiempu lalhai le rorêltuhai po po chun Isu hêkna an zawng a;"
60,"and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,","hretu tehlêm tamtak hung hai sien khawm an hmu si nawh a. A nakie ruok chun mi pahni an hung a,"
61,"and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.","“Hi mipa hin, ‘Pathien biekin hi ṭhiek a, ni thum sûnga bâwl nâwk thei ka nih,’ a tih,” an ta."
62,"And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?","Chuongchun, Thiempu Laltak chu a ngîr suok a, a kuomah, “Iengkhawmin i dawn naw maw? Hienghaiin an hêkna che hi iengtizie am a na?” a ta. Isu ruok chu a to zing a."
63,"But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun a kuomah, “Pathien hring hmingin ka vau che, Krista, Pathien Naupa chu i ni am a nih? mi hril rawh,” a ta."
64,"Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.","Isûn a kuomah, “I hril ang chun ka nih; chu nawa khawm, ka hril cheu hi, hi hnung leh Mihriem Naupa hi thilthawtheina changtienga ṭhunga, vân sûm chunga hung in la hmu ding a nih,” a ta."
65,"Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a, “Pathien a hrilsiet tah; hretu dang iengdingin am ngai tâng ei ta? Ngai ta u, Pathien a hrilsietzie chu tuhin in hriet tah. Iengtin am in ngai a?” a ta."
66,"what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.","Anni chun, “Thi tlâk a nih,” tiin an dawn a."
67,"Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,","Chun, a hmaiah chil an sâk a, kutin an hnawk a;"
68,"saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?","chun, aṭhen chun, “Nang Krista, tuin am a ben cheh a? mi hril rawh,” tiin an ben a."
69,"Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilæan.","Chun, Peter chu in inhuon sûng tuollaia chun a ṭhung a; chun, nunghâk pakhat a kuomah a hung a, “Nang khawm, Isu, Galili rama mi kuoma um kha i ni hi,” a ta."
70,"But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.","Ama ruok chun, “I thu hril chu ka hriet dêr nawh,” tiin an rênga hmaah ân phat a."
71,"And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.","Chun, tuol kawt bula chun a va suok phingleh nunghâk dangin ama chu a hmuh a, chutaka umhai kuoma chun, “Hi mipa khawm hi Isu Naza- reth mi kuoma um kha a ni hi,” a ta."
72,"And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.","Chun, “Chu mihriem chu ka hriet nawh,” tiin inkhâmin ân phat nâwk a."
73,"And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art one of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.","Chun, sâwt nawte hnungah a kâwla ngîrhai chun Peter kuomah, “Nang khawm an laia mi i ni ngei el, i ṭawngah ân hriet annâwm,” an ta."
74,"Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.","Ama chun, “Chu mihriem chu ka hriet nawh” tîn ṭawngsie inphur rauin ân khâm tah a. Chun âr a khuong nghâl tah a."
75,"And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.","Chun, Peter chun, Isûn “âr a khuong hmain nangin vawi thum mîn phat i tih,” a ti kha a hung hriet nâwk tah a. Chun, a suok a, a ṭap ta ngâwi ngâwi a."
