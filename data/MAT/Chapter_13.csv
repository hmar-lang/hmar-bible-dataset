1,"On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.","Chu ni chun Isu chu ina inthawkin a fe suok a, dîl panga chun a ṭhung a."
2,"And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.","Chun, a kuomah mipui nasatak an hung inkhâwm a, chuongchun, lawngah a chuong a, a ṭhung a; mipui po po ṭieuphoah an ngîr a."
3,"And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;","Chun, tekhithuin an kuomah thu tamtak a hril a, “Ngai ta u, bu chi thetu chu bu chi the dingin a feh a."
4,"and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:","Chun, a the laiin a ṭhen lampui sîrah a tlah a, vatehaiin an hung tlân zo tah a."
5,"and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:","Chun, aṭhen pielthlêng leihnuoi inphânna hmunah a tlah a, leihnuoi a sa naw leiin a mâwng nghâl tah a."
6,"and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.","Nisienlakhawm, nisa a hung insâng deuin em vuoiin a hung um a, zung a nei naw leiin a rawp el tah a."
7,And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:,"Chun, a ṭhen hlohlingnei lai a tlah a, hlo chu a hung mâwng sâng a, a dîp hmang tah a."
8,"and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.","A ṭhen hnuoi ṭhaah a tlah a, ṭhenkhat a lêt za dâm, ṭhenkhat a lêt sâwmruk dâm, ṭhenkhat a lêt sâwm- thum dâmin a hung ra tah a."
9,"He that hath ears, let him hear.","Tukhawm na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
10,"And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?","Chun, inchûktirhai chu an hung a, a kuomah, “Iengdinga an kuomah tekhithua i hril am?” an ta."
11,"And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.","Chun, ama chun a dawn a, an kuomah, “Vân ram thurûk chu nangni ihriet chu phal a nih, anni ihriet ruok chu phal a ni nawh."
12,"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.","Tukhawm a nei taphawt chu pe sâng an ta, nei ṭeu an tih; nisienlakhawm, tukhawm a nei naw taphawt chu, an nei sun khawm lâkpêk an tih."
13,"Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.","Chuleichun, tekhithuin an kuomah ka hril a nih; hmu hai sien khawm an hmu ngai nawh a, nain hrehai sien khawm an hriet ngai nawh a, a ngaina khawm an hriet ngai naw leiin."
14,"And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:","Chun, Isai thuhrillâwk kha an chungah a hung tlung a ni hi; ‘Na chun hre dêng in ta chu, a ngaina ruok chu hre tawp naw ti niu; Hmu chu hmu dêng in ta chu, hriet ruok chu hre tawp naw ti niu;"
15,"For this people’s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.","Hi chihai lungril hi a lo ngawng tah a, An nahai a lo sêt tah a, An mit an insîm bawk a. Chuong naw chun an mitin hmûng an ta, An nain hrieng an ta, An lungrilin hre bawk an ta, Ngha kîr nâwk an ta, Keiin anni sukdam hlau rawi ka tih,’ a ti kha."
16,"But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.","“Nangni mit chu a vângnei a nih, a hmu hlak leiin; in na khawm a vângnei a nih, a hriet hlak leiin."
17,"For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, zâwlnei tamtakhai le mi fel tam- takhai khawmin, in thil hmuhai hi hmu an inhâwk a, nisienlakhawm, an hmu si nawh a; in thil hriethai khawm hi hriet an inhâwk a; nisienlakhawm, an hriet si nawh a!"
18,Hear then ye the parable of the sower.,"“Chuongchun, bu chi thetu tekhithu chu hre ro:"
19,"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the evil one, and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.","Tukhawmin ram thu chu naa a lo hriet a, a ngaina a hriet si naw chun, mi suol chu a hung a, a lungrila the sa chu a lâkpêk hlak. Chu chu lampui sîra the chu a nih."
20,"And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;","Chun, pielthlêng hmuna the chu, thu hre a, lâwmtaka pawm nghâl hlak hi a nih;"
21,"yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.","nisienlakhawm, amaa chun zung a um naw leiin sâwt nawte chau a um a; chun, thu lei chun, rinumna amanih, suknawmnatna amanih a hung um phingleh a tlu nghâl el hlak."
22,"And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.","Chun, hlohlingnei laia the chu, thu hretu a na; nisienlakhawm, khawvêl lungkhamna le hausakna hlêmna chun thu chu a dîp a, ra loin a um hlak."
23,"And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.","Chun, leihnuoi ṭha chunga the chu, thu chu naa hre a, a ngaina hre bawk hi a nih. Chu chu a ra ngei a, ṭhenkhat a lêt za dâm, ṭhenkhat a lêt sâwmruk dâmin, ṭhenkhat a lêt sâwmthum dâmin a pung hlak,” a ta."
24,"Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:","Tekhithu dang an kuomah a hril nâwk a, “Vân ram chu, mi a loa chi ṭha thetu le chun hrilkhi a nih;"
25,"but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.","nisienlakhawm, mi an in kârin a hmêlma a hung a, bu lai chun bu tehlêm a the a, a fe hmang nâwk tah a."
26,"But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.","Chun, bu chu a hung mâwng a, a hung vui chun, bu tehlêm chu a hung inlang ve tah a."
27,"And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?","Chun, in neitu suokhai chu an hung a, a kuoma chun, ‘Pu, i loah chi ṭha i the a ni naw am a nih? bu tehlêm saw khâwlaia hung um am a ni leh?’ an ta."
28,"And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, ‘Chu chu hmêlmain a lo thaw a ni ta chu,’ a ta. Chun, suokhai chun a kuomah, ‘Chuong chu la khâwm el inlang rem i ti?’ an ta."
29,"But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.","Ama ruok chun, ‘Ti lo e; bu tehlêm chu in lâk khâwm chun bu chu phawi sa hlau rawi in tih."
30,"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.","Bu sîk chenin um hmun khat raw se; chun, bu sîk pha chun, bu âttuhai kuomah, bu tehlêm chu la khâwm hmasa phawt unla, raw dingin intêl ro, bu ruok chu ka inah sêk lût ro, la tîng ka tih,’ a tih a,” a ta."
31,"Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:","Tekhithu dang an kuomah a hril nâwk a, “Vân ram chu anṭam chi mal khat mîn a lâk a, a loa a the ang chu a na;"
32,"which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.","chu chu chi po poa chîn tak a na: nisienlakhawm, a hung mâwng sâng pha chun, thlaihai nêk chun a lien lem a, thing a hung ni hlak a, chuongchun, chunglêng vatehai chu an hung a, a zârhaia chun an riek hlak a,” a ta."
33,"Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.","Tekhithu dang an kuomah a hril nâwk a, “Vân ram chu chawl, nu- hmeiin a ilâk, beiphit tekhâwng thum laia arênga a tho vawng hmakhata a iphûm ang chu a nih,” a ta."
34,All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:,"Chuong po po chu Isûn tekhi- thuin mipuihai kuomah a hril a, tekhithu nawin iengkhawm a hril nawh:"
35,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.","zâwlneiin, “Tekhithuin ka bau kâng ka ta, Leihnuoi insieng tîra inthawka thil inthup chu hril dawk ka tih,” tia a hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin."
36,"Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.","Chu lai chun mipuihai chu a fesan a, ina chun a lût tah a; chun, a inchûktirhai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Loa bu tehlêm tekhithu kha mi hrilfie rawh,” an ta."
37,"And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;","Chun, ama chun a dawn a, “Chi ṭha thetu chu Mihriem Naupa hi a nih;"
38,"and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;",Lo chu khawvêl hi a na; chi ṭhahai chu Ram nauhai an na; bu tehlêmhai chu suol nauhai an nih.
39,and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.,Hmêlma a thetu chu diebol a na; bu sîk chu khawvêl tâwpna ding a na; bu sîktuhai chu vântirkohai an nih.
40,As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.,"Chuongchun, bu tehlêmhai chu an lâk khâwma meiah an raw ang hin khawvêl tâwpnaa chun la um a tih."
41,"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,","Mihriem Naupa hin a vântir- kohai chu tir dawk a ta, a rama inthawka insuksuoltirtuhai le thil suksuoltuhai po po chu thlang dawk an ta,"
42,and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.,"rawtuina meia chun pei an ta, chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu la um a tih."
43,"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.","Chu pha chun, mi felhai chu an Pa rama chun nisa angin var tâng an tih. Na nei chun hre raw se."
44,"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.","“Vân ram chu loa ro phûmrûk ang a nih; chu chu miin a hmuh a, a thup hmang a, a lâwm leiin a feh a, a nei po po chu a va zawr a, chu lo chu ân châwk tah a."
45,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:","“Chun, vân ram chu sumdâwng mi lunghlu ṭhatak zawngtu ang chu a ni nâwk a,"
46,"and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.","chun, ama chun lunghlu hlutak pakhat a hmuh a, a fe tah a, a nei po po chu a va zawr a, ân châwk tah a."
47,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:","“Chun, vân ram chu lênkhang tuisuorieta dênga, chi tinrêng fûn khâwmna ang chu a ni nâwk bawk a."
48,"which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.","Chu chu a sip phingleh va- pangah an hnûk dawk a; chun, an ṭhung a, a ṭha po chu bâwmah an lâk khâwm a, a sie ruok chu an pei a."
49,"So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,","Khawvêl tâwp pha chun chuong ang bawk chun la um a tih; vân- tirkohai chu hung suok an ta, mi fel laia inthawkin mi suol hai chu ṭhêng an ta,"
50,and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.,"rawtuina meia chun pei an ta; chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih,” a ta."
51,"Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Chuong po po chu in hriet am?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Hre e,” an ta."
52,"And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Chuong a ni chun Dân inchûktirtu vân ram lampui inchûktira um taphawt chu, in neitu, a ro bâwma inthawka thil tharhai le, thil hluihai phawr dawk hlaktu ang chu a nih,” a ta."
53,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.","Chun, Isûn chuong tekhithuhai chu a hril zo phingleh, chutaka inthawk chun a fe tah a."
54,"And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?","Chun, a umna khuo tieng chu a tlung a, an inkhawmna ina chun anni ân chûktir tah a; chuongchun, mak an ti hle a. “Hi mipa hin, hieng varna le, thilmak thaw theinahai hi, khâw- laia inthawka a hmu am a ni leh?"
55,"Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?","Hi mi pa hi thingrem siemtu naupa kha a ni naw am a nih? A unauhai khawm, Jakob, Josef, Simon, Juda an tihai chu an ni naw am a nih?"
56,"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?",A farnuhai khawm ei kuoma um an ni vawng a ni naw am a nih? Hi mi hin khâwlaia inthawk hrima hieng po po hi a hmu am a na?” an ta.
57,"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.","Chuongchun, a chungah an lungni ta nawh a. Nisienlakhawm, Isûn an kuomah, “Zâwlnei chu ama khuo tieng le ama ina chau naw chu inpâk loin a um ngai nawh,” a ta."
58,And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.,"Chun, an ring naw leiin chutaka chun thilmak tam a thaw ta nawh a."
