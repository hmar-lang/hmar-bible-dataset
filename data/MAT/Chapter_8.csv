9,"For I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.","Kei khawm mi thua um ka na, ka hnuoiah sipaihai an um a; chu mipa kha mipa chu, ‘Fe rawh,’ ka ti leh a fe hlak; mi dang kuoma khawm, ‘Hung rawh,’ ka ti leh a hung hlak, ka suok kuoma khawm, ‘Ahi thaw rawh,’ ka ti leh a thaw hlak,” tiin a dawn a."

25,"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish.","A kuomah an hung a, an keitho a, “Lalpa, mi sanhim rawh, kan bohmang ding annâwm hi,” an ta."

28,"And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.","Chun, râl khingtieng Gadarin mihai ram chu a tlungin, khawhri iman pahni, thlâna inthawka hung suokin, an hung intuokpui a; an hrâng bêk a; chuongchun, chu lampuia chun tukhawm an fe thei nawh a."
29,"And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?","Chun, ngai ta, anni chun, “Pathien Naupa, nang le keini ieng am ei inzâwlna? A hun tlung hmain a mi sawisa dinga hitaka hung am i nih?” tiin an khêk a."

31,"And the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.","Khawhrihai chun, “I mi hnawt dawk chun vawk ruol sûngahai sawn mîn fetir rawh,” tiin a kuomah an ngên a."
32,"And he said unto them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Fe ta ro am,” a ta. Chuongchun, an hung suok a, vawkhai sûnga chun an va lût a; chun, ngai ta, vawk ruol po po chu râwlah an tlân thla hum hum el a; dîlah an tla lût a, tuia chun an tla hlum tah a."
