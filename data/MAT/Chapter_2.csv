1,"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,","Chun, lal Herod inlal laia, Juda rama Bethlehemah Isu a hung piengin, ngai ta, khawsak tienga inthawkin mi varhai Jerusalemah an hung a,"
2,"Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him.","“Judahai lal hung pieng chu khâwlai am a um a? A arasi khawsak tieng kan hmuh a, ama chibai bûk dingin kan hung a nih,” an ta."
3,"And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.","Lal Herod chun a hriet phingleh a lunginzîng tah a, Jerusalema mi po po khawm an lunginzîng ve a."
4,"And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.","Chuongchun, thiempu lalhai le mihai Dân inchûktirtu po po a ko khâwm a. Krista piengna ding chu ân dawn a."
5,"And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written through the prophet,","Anni chun a kuomah, “Juda rama Bethlehemah hieng ang hin zâwl- neiin a ziek kha,"
6,"And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah: For out of thee shall come forth a governor, Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel.","‘Chun, nang Juda rama Bethlehem, Juda khawpuihai laiah i chîn tak naw tawp; I sûnga inthawkin awptu a hung suok ding a ni sih a, Ka mi Israelhai vêngtu ding chu,’ ti hi,” an ta."
7,"Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared.","Chu hnunga chun Herodin mi varhai chu arûkin a ko a, arasi inlang hun chu nguntakin anni ân dawn a."
8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word, that I also may come and worship him.","Anni chu Bethlehemah ân fetir tah a, “Fe unla, nautê thu chu nguntakin indawn suok ro; chun kei khawmin ama chu chibai ka hung bûk ve theina dingin, in hmu phingleh mi hung hril nâwk ro,” a ta."
9,"And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.","Chun, lal thu chu an hriet a, an fe tah a; chun, ngai ta, khawsak tienga arasi an hmu kha nautê umna chung zâwn a tlunga a ngîr hmakhat chu an hmaah a fe pei a."
10,"And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.","Chun, arasi chu an hmuin an hlim nasa bêk bêk a."
11,"And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.","In sûngah an va lût a, a nu Mari kuoma nautê chu an hmuh a, an bawkkhup a, chibai an bûk a. Chun, an ro bâwmhai an hawng a, a kuomah lâwmna — rângkachak dâm, beraw dâm, murra dâm an pêk a."
12,"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.","Herod kuoma kîr nâwk lo dingin manga hrila an um leiin, lampui dangah an khuo tieng an kîr tah a."
13,"Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.","Chun, an fe hnungin, ngai ta, Lalpa vântirko Josef kuomah a mangah ân lâr a, “Tho la, nautê le a nu ṭhuoi la, Aigupta ramah tlân hmang rawh, ka hril nâwk hmakhat che chu chutaka chun um zing rawh; Herodin nautê sukbo dingin a zawng ding a nih,” a ta."
14,"And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt;","Chuongchun, a tho a, azân azânin nautê le a nu a ṭhuoi a, Aiguptaah a fê tah a."
15,"and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son.","Herod thi hmakhat chu chutaka chun a um zing a; Lalpain zâwlnei baua, “Ka naupa chu Aiguptaa inthawkin ka ko dawk a,” tia a hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin."
16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise-men.","Chun, Herodin mi varhai hlêmin a um ti ân hriet phingin a lung a sen bêk bêk a, mi a tir a, a hun laitak thu mi varhai nguntaka ân dawn suo ang khan, Bethlehem le a vêl po poa pasal naupang kum hnia inthawka hnuoitieng po po chu an rêngin a that ta vawng a."
17,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,",Chuong lai chun zâwlnei Jeremiain hieng thu a hril hi a hung tlung tah a:
18,"A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; And she would not be comforted, because they are not.","“Rama khuoah khêkri an hriet a, Ṭap dâm, mithi ngaia khêk rawng rawng dâm; Rakil chun a nauhai a ṭah a, An um ta naw leiin thlamuong thei a ni nawh,” ti hi."
19,"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,","Nisienlakhawm, Herod chu a thi hnungin, ngai ta, Lalpa vântirko Aiguptaa chun Josef kuomah mangah ân lâr a,"
20,"Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child’s life.","“Tho la, nautê le a nu ṭhuoi la, Israel ramah fe rawh; nautê that tumtuhai kha an thi tah,” a ta."
21,"And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.","Chuongchun, a tho a, nautê le a nu chu a ṭhuoi a, Israel ramah a lût tah a."
22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judæa in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,","Nisienlakhawm, Arkelaus a pa Herod aiawin ân lal ti a hrietin chutaka fe chu a ṭi tah a; chun, a manga hrila a um leiin Galili tieng a fe ta dai a."
23,"and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene.","Khuo pakhat Nazareth an tia chun a va um tah a: “Ama chu Nazareth mi tîng an tih,” tia zâwlnei baua an hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin."
