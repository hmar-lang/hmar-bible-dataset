1,"For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.","“Vân ram chu in neitupa, a grêp huona sinthawtuhai ruoi dinga zîngkâr inhmataka suok ang chu a ni sih a."
2,"And when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard.","Chun, ama chun, sinthawtuhai le chun ni khata dulil hlaw dinga an inrem phingleh, huona chun a tir tâwl tah a."
3,"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the marketplace idle;","Chun, vairik lai vêlin a va suok a, mi dang dâwr hmuna ngîr mei meihai a hmuh a;"
4,"and to them he said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.","an kuomah, ‘Nangni khawm grêp huonah va fe ta u, a mawi tâwk ang pei pêng ka ti cheu,’ a ta. Chuongchun, an fe tah a."
5,"Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.","Chun, nisa inding vêl le zân bu suong pha vêl lai chun a va suok nâwk a; chuong ang bawkin a thaw nâwk a."
6,"And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?","Chun, zântieng chun a va suok a; mi dang lo ngîrhai chu a hmu a; an kuomah, ‘Iengdinga sûnnithlâka hitaka ngîr mei mei cheu am?’ a ta."
7,"They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard.","Anni chun a kuomah, ‘Tu- khawmin an mi ruoi naw leiin,’ an ta. Ama chun an kuomah, ‘Nangni khawm grêp huonah va fe ta u,’ a ta."
8,"And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.","“Chun, khuo a hung inhnu chun, grêp huon neitupa chun a sum en- kawltu kuomah, ‘Sinthawtuhai kha ko la, a nuhnungtaka phutin a hma- satak chenin an hlaw pe rawh,’ a ta."
9,"And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling.","Chun, zântienga a iruoihai chu an hung chun duli an hmu seng a."
10,"And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling.","Chun, a hmasatakhai an hung chun hmu tam deu an inring a; nisienlakhawm, anni khawm chun duli bawk an hmu seng a."
11,"And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,","Chuongchun, an lâk lai chun, in neitupa chungah an chier a,"
12,"saying, These last have spent but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.","‘Hieng a nuhnungtakhai hin darkâr khat chau an thawh a, keini sûn rinum le khawsa dotuhai tlukin i siem sih a,’ an ta."
13,"But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a shilling?","Ama ruok chun anni laia mi pakhat kuomah, ‘Ruola, i chungah iengkhawm ka suksuol lêm; duli hlaw dingin ei inrem naw am a nih?"
14,"Take up that which is thine, and go thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee.","I ta kha la la fe el rawh; nang ka ipêk che ang bawk kha, hi a nuhnung tak kuoma khawm hin ka pêk nuom a nih."
15,"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good?","Ka ta nâknâk chu ka nuom ang anga ka thaw a thieng naw am a nih? Annawleh, kei ka ṭhat leiin nangin i thîk am a nih?’ tîn a dawn a."
16,"So the last shall be first, and the first last.","Chuongangin a nuhnungtak- hai chu a hmasatak la nîng an ta, a hmasatakhai khawm chu a nu- hnungtakhai la nîng an tih,” a ta."
17,"And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them,","Chun, Isu Jerusalema a hang fe laiin, inchûktirhai sâwm le pahni chu a tumin a ṭhuoi a, lampuia chun an kuomah,"
18,"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death,","“Ngai ta u, Jerusalemah ei fe ding a ni hi. Mihriem Naupa hi thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai kutah inmantirin a um ding a nih; chun, anni chun thi dingin a chungah thu sukthlûng an ta;"
19,"and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be raised up.","nuiza siemna dinga hmang ding le, vuok ding le krawsa hemde dingin Jentailhai kuomah pêng an tih; chun, ni thum niin keithoin um a tih,” a ta."
20,"Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping him, and asking a certain thing of him.","Chu lai chun, Zebedai naupa- salhai nu chu, a naupahai ṭhuoiin a kuomah a hung a, chibai a bûk a, ieng amanih a hnih a."
21,"And he said unto her, What wouldest thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ieng am i dit a?” a ta. Ama chun a kuomah, “Hieng ka naupahai pahni hi i ramah i changtiengah pakhat, i vawitiengah pakhat an ṭhung theina dingin thu pe ta la,” a ta."
22,"But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say unto him, We are able.","Isu ruok chun “In hni hi in hriet naw a nih, ka no dâwn ding chu in dâwn thei am a nih?” a ta, a dawn a. Annîn a kuomah, “Thei e,” an ta."
23,"He saith unto them, My cup indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared of my Father.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ka no chu dâwn ngei in tih; nisienlakhawm, ka changtieng le ka vawitienga ṭhung ding thu chu keia pêk ding a ni nawh a, ka Pa ibuotsaipêkhai ta ding ni lem a tih,” a ta."
24,"And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.","Chun, sâwm hai chun chu chu an lo hrietin unau pahni hai chunga chun an lunginsen tah a."
25,"But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.","Isu ruok chun anni chu a ko a, “Jentailhai chunga rorêltuhai chu an chungah an inlal bêk bêk hlak a, an mi lienhai chun an chungah thu an nei bêk bêk hlak ti in hriet."
26,Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister;,"Nisienlakhawm, nangni laia chu chuong ang chu ni naw ni, tukhawm nangni laia mi lien ni nuom phawt chu in rawngbâwltuin a um ding a nih,"
27,and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant:,tukhawm nangni laia a hma- satak ni nuom taphawt chu in sie- hlawin a um bawk ding a nih;
28,"even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.","Mihriem Naupa hi rawng- bâwlpêka um dinga hung a ni nawh a, rawngbâwl ding le mi tamtak intlan- na dinga, a hringna pe lem dinga a hung ang hin,” a ta."
29,"And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.","Chun, Jerikoa inthawka an suok laiin mipui nasatakin ama an zui a."
30,"And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.","Chun, ngai ta, mitdel pahni lam sîra ṭhunghai chun Isu a fe ti an hriet phingleh, “Lalpa, David Naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin an khêk a."
31,"And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.","Chun, mipui chun to dingin an hal a; nisienlakhawm, anni chun “Lalpa, David Naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin an khêk nâwk zuol a."
32,"And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you?","Chun, Isu a ngîr a, anni a ko a, “In chungah ieng ang am ka thaw in nuom a?” a ta."
33,"They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, mit var kan nuom,” an ta."
34,"And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and followed him.","Chuongchun, Isûn a lunginsiet bêk bêk a, an mit a them a; chuongchun, an hmu thei nghâl tah a, ama chu an zui tah a."
