1,"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.","“In thil ṭha thawhai chu mihriem hmaa, an ihmu dinga thaw lo dingin fimkhur ro; chuong naw chun in Pa vâna mi kuomah lâwmman nei naw ti niu."
2,"When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.","Chuongchun, mi kuoma thil i pêkin, mi vervêkhaiin mi inpâk an hlaw theina dinga, inkhâwmna in- haia le, kawtthlêrhaia an thaw hlak angin, i hmaah tawtawrâwt inmûttir naw."
3,"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:","Titakzetin ka hril cheu, an lâwmman chu an hmu zo tah. Nang ruok chun mi kuoma thil i pêkin, i kut changtiengin a thaw chu i kut vawitiengin hre naw raw se; i thilpêk chu a rûk a ni theina dingin;"
4,that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.,"chuongchun, i Pa a rûka hmutu che chun thung a ti che."
5,"And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.","“Chun, in ṭawngṭaiin, mi vervêk- hai angin in thaw ding a ni nawh, mîn an hmu theina dingin, inkhâwmna inahai, kawtthlêr ṭhuom laitakahai ngir puma ṭawngṭai an ngaina sih a. Titakzetin ka hril cheu, an lâwmman chu an hmu zo tah."
6,"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.","Nang ruok chun i ṭawngṭaiin, i pindan sûng rilah lût la, i kawt khâr la, i Pa arûka um kuoma chun ṭawng- ṭai rawh; chuongchun, i Pa arûka hmutu che chun thung a ti che."
7,"And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.","“Chun in ṭawngṭaiin, Jentailhai angin hril ngai hril mei mei naw ro; an ṭawng tam leiin hrein an ring a nih."
8,"Be not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.","Chuongchun, anni angin um naw ro; ama in hni hmain in Pa chun ieng ieng am in pawimaw ti chu a hriet zing a nih."
9,"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.","“Chuongchun, nangni chu hieng ang hin ṭawngṭai ro: Kan Pa vâna mi, I hming inzaum raw se, I ram hung tlung raw se."
10,"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.","I dit zâwng vâna mîn an thaw angin, hnuoia mîn thaw raw se,"
11,Give us this day our daily bread.,"Vawisûn hin kan fâkkhawpin bu mi pe la,"
12,"And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.","Kan bathai hi mi ngaidamla, Keini khawmin kan iengkhat battuhai kan ngaidam ang khan."
13,"And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.","Suol dinga thlêmnaa chun mi ṭhuoi lût naw la, Mi suol laka chu mi sandam lem rawh, tiin."
14,"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.","“Mi an bawsiethai in ngaidam chun, in Pa vâna mîn ngaidam vêng a ti cheu."
15,"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","Nisienlakhawm, mihai in ngai- dam si naw chun, in Pain in baw- sietnahai ngaidam bîk naw ni."
16,"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.","“Bu in nghei pha khawmin, mi vervêkhai angin ngui hmêl put naw ro; anni chun mi mithmua bungheia an inlang theina dingin an hmêl an sukpawr hlak sih a. Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, an lâwmman chu an hmu zo tah."
17,"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;","Nang ruok chun bu i nghei pha i lu sahriek nâl la, i hmai phi rawh;"
18,"that thou be not seen of men to fast, but of thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall recompense thee.","chuongchun, i Pa arûka um mithmua chau naw chun, mihriem mithmuah bungheiin inlang naw ti ni; chuongchun, i Pa arûka hmutu che chun thung a ti che."
19,"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal:","“Hnuoia hângthim le tuiêkin a fâk sietnaah, inruhaiin an verpawpa an inrûknaa hin in ta dingin rohai inkhâwl naw ro."
20,"but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:","Vânah, hângthim le tuiêkin a fâk siet nawnaah, inruhaiin an ver- pawpa an inrûk nawnaa chun, in ta dingin rohai siekhâwl lem ro;"
21,"for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.",i ro umna taphawtah i lungril khawm a um ding a ni sih a.
22,"The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.",“Taksa khâwnvar chu mit hi a nih; i mit a var chun i taksa a rêngin var suok a tih.
23,"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness!","I mit a se ruok chun i taksa a rêngin inthim vawng a tih. Chuong- chun, i sûnga var chu inthim ni sien chu, inthim chu a va nasa awm ngei de!"
24,"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","“Tukhawmin hotu pahni rawng bâwl kawp thei naw ni hai; pakhat theidain pakhat dit an tih, annawleh, pakhat ṭanin pakhat hmusit an tih. Pathien le sum rawng bâwl kawp thei naw ti niu."
25,"Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment?","“Chuleichun, ka hril cheu hi, ‘Ieng am dâwnin ieng am fa tâng ka ta?’ tiin, in hringna thu le, ‘Ieng am silin bil ka ta aw?’ tiin, in taksa thu lungkham naw ro. Fâkding nêkin hringna a hlu lem a ni naw am a nih? Silfên nêkin taksa khawm a hlu lem a ni naw am a nih?"
26,"Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than they?","“Chunglêng vatehai hi en ta u; bu an tu nawh a, an sîk bawk nawh a; bu ina khawm an sêklût bawk nawh, nisienlakhawm, in Pa vâna mi chun a châwm sih a. Nangni chu anni nêkin nasatakin in hlu lem a ni naw am a nih?"
27,And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life?,"Chun, nangni lai tuin am lung- kham leiin mâni dung tieng tawng khata suksâng chuong thei cheu?"
28,"And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:","Chun, silfên thuah iengdinga in lungkham am a na? Ram tûktinpâr inṭhangzie hi ṭha takin ngaituo ro; sin an thaw nawh, pat khawm an kher bawk nawh;"
29,"yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","nisienlakhawm, ka hril cheu hi, Solomon meu khawm a ropuina po poa ân thuom khan hieng tûktinpâr pakhat tluk khawm hin cheiin a um nawh."
30,"But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?","Chuongchun, ram hlohna, vawi- sûn anga hringa, a zînga thuka ti nâwk el ding hman Pathienin chuong ang lâwma a chei chun, aw! nangni ringna tlâwmhai, silfên a pêk lem hman hman ding cheu a ni naw am a nih?"
31,"Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?","Chuongchun, ‘Ieng am fâng ei ta?’ ‘Ieng am dâwn ei ta?’ amanih, ‘Ieng silin am um ei ta?’ ti amanih, lungkham naw ro. Jentailhaiin chuong po po chu an zawng hlak a nih."
32,For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.,Chuong po po chu in pawimaw ti in Pa vâna miin a hriet zing a nih.
33,"But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.","A ram le a felna chu zawng hmasa lem ro; chuongchun, chuong po po chu a pêk sa ding cheu a nih."
34,Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.,"Chuongchun, a zînga dingin lungkham naw ro, a zîng chun ama ding chu a lungkham fâwm ding a ni sih a. Ni khat dingin ni khat rimsik a hun a nih."
