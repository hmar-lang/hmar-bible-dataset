1,At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat.,"Chu lai chun, Isu chu châwlniin bu bilah a fe thleng a; a inchûktirhai chu an phîng a ṭâm a, buvuihai chu an thliek a, an fâk tah a."
2,"But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath.","Chun, Pharisaihaiin chu chu an hmu chun a kuomah, “En ta, i inchûktirhaiin Châwlnia thaw thieng naw chu an thaw hi,” an ta."
3,"But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;","Ama ruok chun an kuomah, “A ruolhai le an phîng ṭâm laia David thilthaw kha in tiem ngai naw am a nih?"
4,"how he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?","Khânga Pathien inah a lût a, ama le a ruolhai fâk thieng naw, thiempuhai chau ifâk thieng entirna bei an fâk thu kha?"
5,"Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless?","Annawleh, Châwlniin Pathien biekina thiempu umhai chun Châwlni an bawr khawmin an thiem pei ti Dân thua chun in tiem naw am a nih?"
6,"But I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here.","Iengkhawm ni sien, Pathien biekin nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um ti ka hril cheu hi."
7,"But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.","Nisienlakhawm, ‘Inthâwina dit loin lunginsietna ka dit,’ ti hi a umzie hre thiem sa ni unla chu, mi thiemhai chu thiemnaw in inchangtir naw ding bah."
8,For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.,"Mihriem Naupa hi Châwlni Lal a ni sih a,” a ta."
9,"And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue:","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun a feh a, an inkhâwmna inah a va lût a."
10,"and behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.","Chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat kut zeng a lo um a, chun, an hêk theina dingin, “Châwlniin sukdam a thieng am?” tiin Isu an indawn a."
11,"And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni laia tukhawmin berâm pakhat nei unla, chu chu Châwlniin khurah tla ta ang sienla, tuin am chelin kei dawk nâwng in ta?"
12,How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.,"Berâm pakhat nêk chun mi- hriem pakhat chu a va hlu lem de! Chuleichun, Châwlnia sukṭhat a thieng,” a ta."
13,"Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.","Chu phingleh, chu mipa kuoma chun, “I kut phar rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, a phar a, a khing tieng angin a dam ta var a."
14,"But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.","Chuongchun, Pharisaihai chu an suok a, ama an sukhlum theina ding dân ngaituoin an inrâwn a."
15,"And Jesus perceiving it withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn chu chu a hrietin, chutaka inthawk chun a fe hmang tah a."
16,and charged them that they should not make him known:,"Chun, mi tamtakin ama an zui a, an rêngin a lo sukdam vawng a, a chanchin phuong lo dingin an kuomah a ti tlat a."
17,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,",Zâwlnei Isaiin hieng thu a hril hi a hung tlung theina dingin:
18,"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.","“En ta, ka siehlaw, ka ithlang, Ka idittak, ka lungrilin a ilâwm bêk bêk hi; A chungah ka Thlarau sieng ka ta, Chuongchun, Jentailhai kuomah rorêlna thu hril a tih."
19,"He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.","Sêl naw nih a, khêk bawk naw nih a; Kawtthlêrhaia khawm tukhawmin a râwl hre bawk naw ni hai."
20,"A bruised reed shall he not break, And smoking flax shall he not quench, Till he send forth judgment unto victory.","Hne dinga rorêlna a tir dawk hma khat chun Luong pawr suktan naw nih a, Pat khu khawm sukmit naw ni."
21,And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.,"Ama hming chu Jentailhai chun beisei phâng an tih,” ti hi."
22,"Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw.","Chu lai chun, mitdel ṭawng- theinaw khawhri iman pakhat a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; chun, ama chun a lo sukdam a, chuongchun, ṭawngtheinaw chu a hung ṭawng theiin, a hung hmu thei tah a."
23,"And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?","Chun, mipuihai po po chun mak an ti hle a, “Hi mipa hi David naupa chu a ni naw am a nih?” an ta."
24,"But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.","Nisienlakhawm, Pharisaihaiin chu chu an hriet phingleh, “Hi mipa hin khawhri lal Beelzebub lei naw chun khawhrihai hnawt dawk naw ni,” an ta."
25,"And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:","Chun, Isûn an ngaituohai chu a lo hriet a, an kuomah, “Khâwlai ram khawm mâni indo taphawt chu an bo hlak; khâwlai khuo khawm sûngkhat khawm, mâni indo taphawt chu ngîr suok naw ni hai."
26,"and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?","Setanin Setan bawk a hnawt dawk chun, mâni indo nîng a tih in sawnnaw; a ram chu iengtin am ngîr suok a ta?"
27,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.","Kei Beelzebub leia khawhrihai hnawt dawk hlak ka lo ni chun, in nauhaiin tu leiin am an lo hnawt dawk hlak lie? Chuleiin, anni chu nangni ngaituotu dinghai nîng an tih."
28,"But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.","Amiruokchu, kei Pathien Thlarau leia khawhrihai hnawt dawk hlak ka ni chun, Pathien ram in kuomah a hung tlung tah nîng a tih."
29,"Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.","Chuongchu a ni si naw chun, miin mi hrât chu a khuop hmasa bak naw chun, iengtin am mi hrât inah lûtin a sum lapêk thei a ta? Chu hnunga ruok chun a in chu inrampêk el a tih."
30,He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.,Tukhawm keia tienga ṭhang naw chu a mi do a nih; tukhawm a mi lâk khâwmpui naw chun a sukdar a nih.
31,"Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.","“Chuleiin, ka ti cheu hi, mi an suolna tinrênga le, Pathien an hril- sietna tinrênga chun ngaidam nîng an ta, Thlarau Inthieng meu hrilsetu ruok chu ngaidam ni naw ni hai."
32,"And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.","Chun, tukhawm Mihriem Nau- pa sawisêl taphawt chu a sawisêlna chu ngaidam nîng a ta; tukhawm Thlarau Inthieng meu sawisêl taphawt chu a sawisêlna chu, hi dam sûnga khawm, hun la hung tlung dinga khawm chun, ngaidam ni naw nih."
33,"Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.","“Thing chu a ṭha a, a ra khawm a ṭha, in ti naw nghâl an leh, thing chu a sie a, a ra khawm a sie, ti nghâl nghâl ro; thing chu a rain ân hriet sih a."
34,"Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.","Rûl thlahai, nangnîn suol zing pumin, iengtin am thu ṭha hril thei in ta? Lungrila sip liem chu bauin a hril hlak in sawnnaw."
35,The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.,"Mi ṭha chun a robâwm ṭhaa inthawkin thil ṭhahai a the dawk hlak, mi suol chun a robâwm siea inthawkin thil ṭha naw a the dawk hlak."
36,"And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.","Chun, ka hril cheu hi, mihaiin thu teplo an hril taphawt, chuong thu chanchin chu ngaituo nia chun hril an tih."
37,"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.","I thuhril chun thiem inchangtir a ti cheh a, i thuhril bawk chun thiemnaw inchangtir a ti che i sawn- naw,” a ta."
38,"Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.","Chu lai chun, Dân inchûktir- tuhai le Pharisaihai laia tuhaiin amanih an dawn a, a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, i kuoma inthawkin inchikna hmu kan nuom,” an ta."
39,"But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:","Ama ruok chun an kuomah, “Ruolthar suoltak le uire hmang takhai chun inchikna an zawng a; nisienlakhawm, zâwlnei Jona inchik- na chau naw chu an kuomah inchikna hrim hrim pêk ni naw ni;"
40,for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.,"Jona chu ni thum le zân thum ngapui phîng sûnga a um ang khan, Mihriem Naupa hi ni thum le zân thum hnuoi khur sûngah a um bawk ding a nih."
41,"The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.","Ninevi khuoa mihai chu ngaituo pha chun tulai ruoltharhai kuomah hin ngîr vêng an ta, thiemnaw inchangtir an tih; Jona thu hril leiin an sim sih a; Jona nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um in sawnnaw."
42,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.","Simtieng lalnu kha ngaituo pha chun tulai ruoltharhai lai hin tho vêng a ta, thiemnaw inchangtir a tih; Solomon varna ngai ding hmanin kâwlkawdawnga inthawkin a hung sih a; ngai ta u, Solomon nêka ropui lem hitaka hin a um in sawnnaw."
43,"But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.","“Chun, khawhri inthieng naw chu mi sûnga inthawka a suokin, châwlna zawngin tui um nawna hmunahai ân vâk ân vâk a, a hmu ngai si nawh a."
44,"Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.","Chun, ‘Ka suokna ina khan kîr nâwk el ka tih,’ a ta; chun, a va tlung chun, a ruoka, phît faia cheiṭhatin a hmuh a."
45,"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.","Chu phingleh a va feh a, ama nêka suol lem khawhri dang pasari a hung ṭhuoi a, chutaka chun an lût a, an um zing hlak a, chu mihriem um dân nuhnung lem chu a hmasa nêkin a hung ṭha naw lem hlak a nih. Chuong ang bawkin tulai ruolthar suol takhai chunga hin la um a tih,” tiin a dawn a."
46,"While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.","Mipuihai kuoma thu a la hril lai chun, ngai ta, a nu le a unauhai chu ama biek tumin tuolah an ngîr a."
47,"And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.","Chun, mi pakhatin a kuomah, “Ngai ta, i nu le i unauhai biek che tumin tuola sawn an ngîr zing ie,” an ta."
48,"But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?","Ama ruok chun a hriltu kuoma chun, “Ka nu chu tu am a na? Ka unauhai khawm chu tuhai am an na?” tiin a dawn a."
49,"And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!","Chun, a inchûktirhai tieng a kut a phar a, “En ta u, ka nu le ka unauhai hi!"
50,"For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.","Tukhawm ka Pa vâna mi dit zâwng thaw taphawt chu, ka unau le, ka farnu le, ka nuhai an nih in sawnnaw,” a ta."
