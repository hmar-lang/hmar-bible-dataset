6,And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled: for these things must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet.,"Chun, indo thu le indo thuthang la hrieng in ta; in lunginzîng nawna dingin fîmkhur ro; chuong chu a hung tlung ding hrim a nih; nisien- lakhawm, tâwpna chu la ni hri naw nih."

15,"When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand),","“Chuongchun, sukrêmtu tirdak- um, zâwlnei Daniel ihril kha hmun inthienga ngîra in hmu phâ chun (a tiem taphawt chun a umzie hre raw se),"
16,then let them that are in Judæa flee unto the mountains:,Juda rama umhai chu tlânga dâm tlân hmang raw hai se;
17,let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house:,in chunga um chu a ina thilhai inchû dingin ṭum naw raw se;
18,and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak.,"chun, loa um chu a puon inchû dingin kîr nâwk naw raw se;"
19,But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!,Chuong nia chun inrâihai le nautesen pawmhai chung chu rik a tih!
20,"And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on a sabbath:","Chun, in tlân hmang ding hun chu thlasik amanih, châwlni amania a hung tlung nawna dingin ṭawngṭai ro;"
21,"for then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be.","chu phâ chun rinumna nasatak a um ding a ni sih a; chuong ang hrim hrima nasa chu leihnuoi insieng tira inthawkin tu chen hin a la um ngai nawh a, um khawm iengtika khawm um nâwk ta bawk naw ni."
22,"And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.","Chun, chuong nihai chu suk- tâwi ni naw sien chu mihriem hrim hrim damin suok naw ni hai; nisienlakhawm, thlanghai lei chun chuong nihai chu suktâwi nîng a tih."
23,"Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Here; believe it not.","“Chu phâ chun, tukhawmin in kuomah, ‘En ta, Krista chu hitaka hi a um,’ amanih, ‘Hiva hi,’ amanih an ti chun awi naw ro;"
24,"For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.","Krista tehlêm le zâwlnei te- hlêmhai an hung suok ding a ni sih a; thei hai sien la chu, thlanghai rau khawm an hlêm theina dingin inchik- na le thilmak ropuitakhai thâwng an tih."
25,"Behold, I have told you beforehand.","Ngai ta u, ka hril lâwk ta cheu hi."
26,"If therefore they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the inner chambers; believe it not.","Chuongchun, in kuomah, ‘Ngai ta u, thlalêrah a um,’ an ti cheu chun fe suok naw ro, ‘Pindan sûngrilah a um,’ an ti cheu chun awi nuom naw ro."
27,"For as the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen even unto the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.","Kâwl saktieng a hung inlep a, thlangtieng chen khawmin ân lang hlak. Mihriem Naupa hung nâwkna chu chuong ang chu a ni ding a ni sih a."
28,"Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.",Khâwlaia khawm saruong umna taphawta chun mulukawlhai khawm um khâwm an tih.
29,"But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:","“Nisienlakhawm, chuong ni rinum zo phingle chun, nisa inthimin um a ta, thla var ta naw nih a, vâna arasihai hung tlâng an ta, vân thilthawtheinahai chu sukhnîngin um a tih."
30,"and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.","Chu phâ chun Mihriem Naupa inchikna chu vânah inlang a ta, chun, hnuoia um chi tinin an âwmhai chum an ta, Mihriem Naupa hi thil- thawtheina le ropuina nasatak leh vân sûm chunga hung hmûng an tih."
31,"And he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.","Chun, a vântirkohai chu taw- tawrâwt ri nasatak leh tir suok a tih. Anni chun a ithlanghai chu kâwl kil lia inthawkin, vân tâwpa inthawka a tâwp khing tieng chenin lâwr khâwm an tih."
32,"Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh;","“Chuongchun, theichang kûnga hin chu tekhithu chu inchûk ro. A kâu a hung indâwn a, a hna a hung inder chun, nipui a ni ding a nih ti in hriet."
33,"even so ye also, when ye see all these things, know ye that he is nigh, even at the doors.","Chuong ang bawkin nangni khawmin chuong po po chu in hmu phâ chun, ama chu a hung hnai tah a, kawtkhâr bulah a um ti hre ro."
34,"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, chuong po po chu a tlung kim hmakhat chu tulai ruoltharhai hi bo naw ni hai."
35,"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.","Hnuoi le vân bo a ta, ka thu ruok chu bo naw ni."
36,"But of that day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only.","“Nisienlakhawm, chu ni le a phâ thu chu Pa chau naw chun, tukhawmin, vâna vântirkohai khawmin, Naupa khawmin an hriet nawh."
37,"And as were the days of Noah, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.","Chun, Noa damlai ang bawk khan Mihriem Naupa hung nâwkna chu nîng a tih."
38,"For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,","Chuong ni tuilêt hmahai chun, Noa lawnga a lût ni chenin an fâkin an dâwn a, nuhmei pasal an innei hlak;"
39,"and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.","tui a hung lêt a, an rênga a lâk hmang vawng hmakhat chu ieng- khawm an hriet nawh a; Mihriem Naupa hung nâwkna chu chuong ang bawk chu nîng a tih."
40,"Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left:","Chu phâ chun, loah mi pahni um an ta, pakhat chu fe hmangpuiin um a ta; pakhat chu mâksanin um a tih."
41,"two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.","Nuhmei pahni bu râwtnawina chun bu râwtnawiin um an ta, pakhat chu fe hmangpuiin um a ta; pakhat chu mâksanin um a tih."
42,Watch therefore: for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh.,"Chuongchun, ngaiven ro, ieng ni am in Lalpa a hung ding in hriet si nawh a."
43,"But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.","Nisienlakhawm, hi hi hre ro, inru a hung ding pha in neituin hre sienla vêng a ta, a in inverpawptir naw ni."
44,Therefore be ye also ready; for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.,"Chuleiin, nangni khawm inring zingin um ro, in ring naw hunah Mihriem Naupa a hung din g a ni sih a."
45,"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their food in due season?","“Suok ringum vartak, a puin a hun po leh an bu chan ding sem pêk dinga a sûnghai chunga hotua a siem chu tu tak am nîng a ta le?"
46,"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.",A pu a hung phâleh suok chuong anga thawa a hung hmu ding chu a hamṭha.
47,"Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, a inei po po chungah hotûn siem a tih."
48,"But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord tarrieth;","Amiruokchu, suok suol chun a lungrilin, ‘Ka pu a hung vak naw ding a nih,’ tiin,"
49,"and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken;","a suok chanpuihai lo vaw ta sienla, mi inruihai kuomah fain dâwn sienla,"
50,"the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not,","chu suok pu chu a ring naw niah, a hriet naw laiin hung a ta,"
51,"and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.","tum hni hung insuong a ta, mi vervêkhai chan ang hung inchangtir a tih; chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih."
