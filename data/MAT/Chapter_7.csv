2,"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you.","In sawisêl ang bawkin sawisêlin um in tih, in inkhina ngai bawka inkhipêk ni nâwk in tih."

8,for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.,"nawk ro, hawngpêkin um in tih; tukhawm a hni taphawt chun an hmu hlak; tukhawm a zawng chun an hmu hlak; tukhawm a nawk chu hawng- pêk ning an tih."

10,"or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?","Annawleh, nga hni sienla tuin am rûl pêng in ta?"
11,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?","Chuongchun, nangni mi suol hmanin in nauhai thil ṭha pêk nachang in hriet chun, in Pa vâna mi chun a hnituhai chu thil ṭha a pêk lem hman hman naw ding am a nih?"
12,"All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them: for this is the law and the prophets.","“Chuongchun, thil tinrêng mîn in chunga an thaw dinga in dit ding ang peiin, mi chunga khawm thaw ve ro; chu chu Dân le zâwlneihai thu a ni hrim a nih."
13,"Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many are they that enter in thereby.","“Kawtkhâr chîna chun lût ro; bohmangnaa fena kawtkhâr chu a lien a, a lampui khawm a lien bawk a, chu tienga lût chu tam khawm an tam hle a nih."
14,"For narrow is the gate, and straitened the way, that leadeth unto life, and few are they that find it.","Hringnaa fena kawtkhâr chu a chîn a, a lampui khawm ân têp bawk a, a hmutuhai khawm tlâwmte an nih."
15,"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.",“Zâwlnei tehlêmhai lai chun fîmkhur ro; chuonghai chu berâm vun silin in kuomah an hung hlak a; an sûng tienga ruok chu satene hnuk- inrâwltakhai an ni sih a.
16,"By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?",Anni chu an raah hre el in tih. Hrui hlingnei kûngah grêp an lo hlak am a nih? Lênhlinga khawm thei- chang an lo hlak am a nih?
17,Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.,Chuong ang bawkin thing ṭha taphawt chu a ra ṭha hlak; thing ṭha naw ruok chu a ra se hlak.
18,"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","Thing ṭha a ra se thei nawh a, thing ṭha naw hlak a ra ṭha thei bawk nawh."
19,"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.","Thing tin a ra ṭha naw chu an phûr a, meiah an pei hlak."
20,Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.,"Chuleiin, anni chu an raah hrieng in tih."

22,"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy name do many mighty works?","Chu nia chun mi tamtakin, ‘Lalpa, Lalpa, i hmingin thu kan hrilin, i hmingin khawhri dâm kan hnawtdawkin, i hmingin thilmak tamtak kan thaw hlak a ni naw am a nih?’ la tîng an tih."

25,"and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.","Ruo dâm a hung sûr a, tui dâm a hung lien a, thli dâm a hung hrâng a, chu in chu a hung nam sawk sawk a; nisienlakhawm, a chim nawh a; lungpui chunga rem tlat a ni leiin."
26,"And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:","Chun, mi tin hieng ka thu hrea zâwm naw taphawt chu mi invêt phaiphin chung ela in bâwltu leh hrilkhi ding a nih."
27,"and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall thereof.","Ruo dâm a hung sûr a; tui dâm a hung lien a, thli dâm a hung hrâng a, chu in chu a hung nam sawk sawk a; a chim tah a; a chim chu nasatak a nih,” a ta."
28,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:","Chun, Isûn chuong thil chu a hril zo phingleh, mipuihaiin a thu inchûk tir chu mak an ti hleh a;"
29,"for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.","Dân inchûktirtuhai ang loa, thuneina neitaka anni ân chûktir leiin."
