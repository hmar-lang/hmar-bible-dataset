1,"And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,","Chun, Jerusalem an tlung dinga Bethphage khuo, Oliv tlâng chu an tlung chun Isûn a închûktirhai pahni a tir a,"
2,"saying unto them, Go into the village that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.","an kuomah, “In hma zâwna khuoa sawn va fe unla, sabengtung thlung, a kâwla a tê leh hmûng in ta; sût unla, ka kuomah hung kei ro."
3,"And if any one say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.","Tukhawmin in kuomah, ieng- khawm an lo hril chun, ‘Lalpain a mamaw a nih,’ tîng in ta; chun, ama chun hung tîr nghâl el a tih,” a ta."
4,"Now this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,",Zâwlnei baua hieng thu hrila um ta kha a hung tlung theina dingin chuong chu a hung um ta a nih.
5,"Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, Meek, and riding upon an ass, And upon a colt the foal of an ass.","“ ‘En ta, i Lal chu thuhnuoirawltakin, Sabengtung chungah, sabengtungtê chunga ngeia chuongin, I kuomah a hung ding a nih,’ tiin, Zion naunu chu hril rawh,” ti hi."
6,"And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them,","Chuongchun, inchûktirhai chu an va feh a, Isûn an kuoma thu a pêk ang ngeiin an thawh a,"
7,"and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon.","sabengtung le a tê chu an hung kei a, an chunga chun puonhai an phah a, ama chun a chuongpha tah a."
8,"And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the way.","Chun, mipui laia a tam lemin lampuia chun an puonhai an phah a, mi dangin thinga sâwlhna an sât a, lampuiah an pha bawk a."
9,"And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.","Chun, mipui a hma tienga fe le a zuihai chun, “David naupa kuomah Hosanna! Lalpa hminga hung chu inpâkin um raw se! Achunghnungtaka khin, Hosanna!” tiin an khêk a."
10,"And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?","Chun, Jerusalem a lût chun, a khuoin, “Hi mipa hi tu am a na?” tiin an inhnîng sup sup a."
11,"And the multitudes said, This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.","Chun, mipuihai chun, “Hi hi zâwlnei Isu, Galili rama, Nazaretha mi chu a nih,” an ta."
12,"And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;","Chun, Isu Pathien biekina chun a va lût a, biekina iengkhat zawrtuhai le inchawtuhai po po chu a hnawt dawk a, tangka thlengtuhai dawkânhai le vaṭhu zawrhai ṭhung- phahai dâm chu a nam thlûkpêk a,"
13,"and he saith unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of robbers.","an kuomah, “ ‘Ka in chu ṭawngṭaina in tîng an tih,’ ti ziek a na, nangni ruok chun suomhmanghai pûkin in siem lem hlak a nih,” a ta."
14,And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.,"Chun, Pathien biekina chun mitdelhai le kebaihai a kuomah an hung a, anni a sukdam a."
15,"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with indignation,","Nisienlakhawm, thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chun a thilmak thawhai le, biekina, “David naupa kuomah Hosanna” tia, naupang khêkhai chu an hmuin, an lungninaw bêk bêk a,"
16,"and said unto him, Hearest thou what these are saying? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?","a kuomah, Hienghai thu hril hi i hriet am?” an ta. Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Hre e: ‘Nautêhai le nene ne laihai baua suok chun, Inpâkna i sukṭhafamkim tah,’ ti hi in tiem ngai naw am a nih?” a ta."
17,"And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.","Chun, anni chu a mâksan a, khawpuia inthawk chun a suok a, Bethaniah a feh a; chutaka chun a riek tah a."
18,"Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.","Chun, zîngkâra khawpui tienga a kîr nâwk laiin a phîng a hung ṭâm tah a."
19,"And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.","Chun, lam sîra chun theichang kûng a hmuh a, a va pan a, a hna chau naw chu iengkhawm a hmu nawh a."
20,"And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?","Chun, a kuomah, “Kumkhaw- tluongin lo ra ta dêr naw rawh,” a ta. Chun, theichang chu a thêm nghâl el tah a. Chun, inchûktirhai chun chu chu an hmuin, “Iengtiziea theichang hi a thêm nghâl el am a na?” tiin mak an ti hle a."
21,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Titak- zetin ka hril cheu hi, ringna in nei a, in ringhla naw chun, theichang chunga thaw ang chau hi thaw naw ti niu a, hi tlâng kuoma khawm hin, ‘Lo insawn la tuisuorietah lo inpei rawh,’ in ti chun, in ti ang chun lo um a tih."
22,"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.","Chun, iengkim ringtaka ṭawng- ṭaia in hni taphawt chu hmûng in tih,” a ta, a dawn a."
23,"And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?","Chun, Pathien biekina a lût hnunga ân chûktir lai chun, thiempu lalhai le vântlâng upahai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Tu thuin am hieng thil hi i thaw a? Tuin am thu a pêk cheh a?” an ta."
24,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kei khawmin thu bau khat indawn vêng ka ti cheu, chu chu in mi hril chun tu thuin am hieng thilhai hi ka thaw, hril vêng ka ti cheu."
25,"The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?","Johan baptisma kha khâwlaia mi thu am a na? Vâna mi thu am a ni mihriem thu?” a ta, a dawn a. Chun, an inngaituoh a, “Vâna mi thu, ei ti chun, ‘Iengdinga a thu in awi naw am a na’ mi ti sîng a ta."
26,"But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.","Chun, ‘Mihriem thu’ ei ti chun mipui chu ei ṭi sih a; mi po poin Johan chu zâwlneiin an ngai sih a,” an ta."
27,"And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","Chuongchun, Isu an dawn a, “Kan hriet nawh,” an ta. Ama khawm chun an kuomah, “Kei khawmin tu thuin am hieng thil hi ka thawh a hril bîk naw ning cheu."
28,"But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.","“Nisienlakhawm, nangnîn ieng- tin am in ngai a? Mi tuin amanih naupasal pahni a nei a. Pakhat kuoma chun a va feh a, ‘Ka nau, vawisûn grêp huonah sin va thaw rawh,’ a ta."
29,"And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.","Ama chun, ‘Ka nuom nawh,’ a ta, a dawn a; nisienlakhawm, a nakie chun a lungril ân thleng a, a fe tah a."
30,"And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.","Chun, pakhat kuoma khawm chun a va feh a, chuong ang bawkin a va ta. Ama chun, ‘Pu, fêng ka tih’ a ta, a dawn a, nisienlakhawm, a fe ta si nawh a."
31,"Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.","Chuonghai pahni atu lem chun am an pa dit zâwng an thawh a?” a ta. Anni chun, “A hmasa lem chun,” an ta. Isûn an kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, siedâwltuhai le nawchi- zawrhai chun, Pathien ramah an lût khal ding cheu a ni hi."
32,"For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.","Johan chu felna kawnga chun in kuomah a hung a, ama chu in awi si nawh a; nangni chu in hmu hnung khawmin ama chu in awi theina dingin in inlet chuong si nawh a."
33,"Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.","“Tekhithu dang ngai ro, mi tu amanih in neitu a um a, ama chun grêp huon a siem a, palin ân huon vêl a, grêp sâwrna khur a cho a, in insâng a bâwl a; chun, lo enkawltuhai kuomah thlohlaw dingin a pêk a, ram dangah a fe tah a."
34,"And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.","Chun, a ra lo a hun ding chun, a ra lo dingin lo enkawltuhai kuomah a suokhai a tir a."
35,"And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.","Chun, lo enkawltuhai chun a suokhai chu an lo man a, pakhat an vuok a, pakhat an sukhlum a, pakhat lungin an dêng a."
36,"Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner.","Chun, suok dang a hmasa pâwl nêka tam lem a tir nâwk a; annihai chunga khawm an hmaa mihai an thaw ang bawkin an lo thaw nâwk a."
37,"But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.","Chu hnunga ruok chun, ‘Ka naupa hi chu inza ngei an tih,’ tiin a naupa chu an kuomah a tir a."
38,"But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.","Nisienlakhawm, lo enkawltuhai chun a naupa chu an lo hmu phingleh, ‘Hi mipa hi rohluotu ding chu a nih; that ei tiu a, a ro hluo ding hi nei pêk ei tiu,’ an ta."
39,"And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.","Chuongchun, ama chu an man a, grêp huona inthawk chun an pei dawk a, an sukhlum tah a."
40,"When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?","Chuongchun, grêp huon neitupa a hung pha chun chuong lo enkawltuhai chunga chun iengtin am thaw tâng a ta le?” a ta."
41,"They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Chuong mi suolhai chu rimsitakin sukbo- hmang a ta, grêp huon chu lo enkawltu dang, a lo pha poleh rahai chu a kuomah pe pei dinghai kuomah thlohlaw dingin pêng a tih,” an ta."
42,"Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; This was from the Lord, And it is marvellous in our eyes?","Isu chun an kuomah, “Pathien lekhaa, ‘In bâwltuhai lung dit naw kha, Chu ngei chu a kia lung ṭhangkai tak a hung ni tah. Chu chu Lalpa thaw a na, Ei mithmua hin a mak a nih,’ ti hi in tiem ngai naw am a nih?"
43,"Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.","“Chuleichun, ‘Pathien ram chu in kuoma inthawkin lâk hmang nîng a ta, ra insuo ding hnam kuomah pêk nîng a tih,’ ti ka hril cheu hi."
44,"And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.","Chun, chu lung chunga tlu chu kawi dar a ta; a idel lem chu râwt nawi tih” a ta."
45,"And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le Pharisaihai chun a tekhithuhai chu an hrietin, anni chungthu a hril ti an hriet tah a."
46,"And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.","Chun, ama chu man an tum a; nisienlakhawm, mipuihai chu an ṭi sih a, zâwlneiin an ruot leiin."
