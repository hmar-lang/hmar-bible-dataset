1,"Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples,","Chun, Isûn mipuihai le a inchûktirhai kuomah thu a hril a,"
2,"saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat:",“Dân inchûktirtuhai le Pharisai- hai chu Mosie ṭhungphaah an ṭhung hlak.
3,"all things therefore whatsoever they bid you, these do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they say, and do not.","Chuleichun, thaw dinga an hril taphawt cheu chu zâwm unla, thaw pei ro, an thilthaw ang ruok chu thaw ve naw ro, hril chu an hril hlak a, an thaw ngai si nawh a."
4,"Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.","Phurrik rinumtakhai an siem a, mihai an hnâwk hlak a; anni ruok chun an kutpâr khawmin an tâwk nuom nawh."
5,"But all their works they do to be seen of men: for they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,","An thilthaw po po chun mihriem hmu dingin a nih an thaw lem hlak; an iengkhat bunhai le khumhai chu an suklien a, an puon hmawrkai an sukbuk hlak a;"
6,"and love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,","ruoiṭhenaah hmun ṭhatakhai, in- khâwmna inah ṭhungpha ṭhatakhai,"
7,"and the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi.","dâwr hmuna chibai bûkhai, mihaiin, ‘Rabbi’ an itihai an ngaina hlak sih a."
8,"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren.","“Nangni ruok chu, ‘Rabbi’, tia koin um naw ro; in inchûktirtu chu pakhat chau a nih; nangni po po chu unau in ni sih a."
9,"And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, even he who is in heaven.","Chun, hnuoi chunga hin tu- khawm, ‘Pa,’ ti naw ro; in Pa chu pakhat chau a nih, vâna mi khi."
10,"Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master, even the Christ.","‘ṭhuoituhai’ tia ko khawmin um naw ro; in ṭhuoitu chu pakhat chau a nih, Krista chu."
11,But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.,In laia ropuitak chu in rawngbâwltu a um lem ding a nih.
12,And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.,"Tukhawm ân ngaihlu phawt chu tlâwm a ta, tukhawm ân ngaitlâwm phawt chu chawimawiin um a tih."
13,"But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter.","“Nisienlakhawm, nangni Dân inchûktirtu le Pharisai vervêkhai, in chung a rik; vân ram lampui chu mihai in khâr pêk sih a; nangni hlak in lût si nawh a, mi a lût dinghai khawm in inlûttir phal ngai si nawh a."
14,,"[Nangni Dân inchûktirtu le Pharisai vervêkhai, in chung a rik! Hmeithaihai sum in fâk zo a, mi hlêmna dingin sâwttak tak in ṭawng- ṭai a; chuleiin, thiemnaw changna nasa nâwkzuol hmûng in tih.]"
15,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is become so, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.","Nangni Dân inchûktirtu le Pharisai vervêkhai in chung a rik; Saphun pakhat khawm siem dingin tuisuoriet le khawmuol in fe huol sih a, chun, chuong anga a hung um phaleh ama chu nangni lethni rauin Hremhmun naupaah in siem hlak."
16,"Woe unto you, ye blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.","“Nangni ṭhuoitu mitdel, ‘Tukhawm Pathien biekin sâla inkhâm po chu iengkhawm a ni nawh; tukhawm Pathien biekina râng- kachak sâla inkhâm po chun hlen ding a nih,’ tituhai, in chung a rik!"
17,"Ye fools and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?","Nangni mi invêt, mitdelhai, a ieng am a ropui lem a, rângkachak am, Pathien biekin rângkachak sukthiengtu chu?"
18,"And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is a debtor.","Chun, ‘Tukhawm mâichâm sâla inkhâm po chu iengkhawm a ni nawh, a chunga thilpêk sâla inkhâm po ruok chun hlen ding a nih,’ in ta."
19,"Ye blind: for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?","Nangni mitdelhai! A ieng am a ropui lem a, thilpêk am, mâichâm thilpêk sukthiengtu chu?"
20,"He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.","Chuongchun, tukhawm mâi- châm sâla inkhâm taphawt chun mâichâm le a chunga um po po sâlin ân khâm hlak."
21,"And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.","Tukhawm Pathien biekin sâla inkhâm taphawt chun, Pathien biekin le a sûnga um chu sâlin ân khâm hlak."
22,"And he that sweareth by the heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.",Tukhawm vân sâla inkhâm taphawt chun Pathien ṭhungpha le a chunga ṭhung chu sâlin ân khâm hlak a nih.
23,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but these ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.","“Nangni Dân inchûktirtu le Pharisai vervêkhai, in chung a rik! pudina dâm, mohuri dâm, zira dâm chu sâwma pakhat in pêk hlak a, dân thu pawimaw lem felna dâm, lunginsietna dâm, ringumna dâm chu in ngaitha si hlak; nisienlakhawm, chuong chu a nih in sawnnaw in thaw ding chu, a danghai chu thaw ṭhul chuong loin."
24,"Ye blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel!","Nangni ṭhuoitu mitdel, thosi thlitfaia sanghâwngsei lem si hlak- hai!"
25,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full from extortion and excess.","“Dân inchûktirtu le Pharisai vervêkhai, in chung a rik! no le thlêng puo tieng in sâwp fai a, a sûng ruok chu hlêprûkna le insûm nawnain a sip sih a."
26,"Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may become clean also.","Nang Pharisai mitdel, no le thlêng sûng tieng chu sâwp fai hmasa rawh, a puo tieng khawm a hung fai theina dingin.”"
27,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.","“Dân inchûktirtu le Pharisai vervêkhai, in chung a rik! Thlân nâl vâr, puo tienga mawitaka inlang, a sûng tieng ruok chu mithi ruhai le hmunhnawk tinrênga siphai ang chu in nih in sawnnaw."
28,"Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.","Nangni khawm chuong ang takin puo tieng chun, mihriem mit- hmua chun feltakin in inlang hlak, in sûng tienga ruok chun vervêkna le suolnain in sip sih a."
29,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the righteous,","“Nangni Dân inchûktirtu le Pharisai vervêkhai, in chung a rik! zâwlnei thlân inhai in bâwl a, mi fel thlânhai khawm in cheimawi a,"
30,"and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.","‘Ei puhai dam lai khan lo um ve inla khawm, zâwlneihai thisen an insuonaa chun ṭhang ve nâwm ei nih,’ in ti hlak a."
31,"Wherefore ye witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets.","Chuongchun, zâwlneihai that- tuhai nau in nih ti in inhriettir a nih."
32,Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.,In puhai inkhîna chu suksip nghâl nghâl ro.
33,"Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape the judgment of hell?","Rûlhai, rûl thlahai, Hremhmun rorêlna chu iengtin am pumpel thei in ta?"
34,"Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall ye kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:","“Ngai ta u, chuleichun, in kuomah zâwlneihai, mi varhai, inchûktirtuhai, ka hung tir ding a nih; ṭhenkhat sukhlum in ta, krawsah hemdêng in tih, ṭhenkhat inkhâwmna inhaiah savun hruiin vuong in ta, khaw tinah suknawmna zui pei in tih."
35,"that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar.","Chuongchun, Abel mi feltak thisena inthawkin Pathien biekin le mâichâm inkâra Baraki naupa Zakari in ithat a thisen chen khan, hnuoi chunga mi fel thisen an insuo po po chu nangni chungah la hung tlung thei a tih."
36,"Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, chuong po po chu tulai ruoltharhai chunga hin la tlung a tih."
37,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!","“Aw Jerusalem, Jerusalem! zâwlneihai thattu, i kuoma an hung tirhai lunga lo dêng hlumtu, ârpuiin a têhai a thla hnuoia a awp khâwm angin, i nauhai vawi iengzât am awp khâwm ka tum a! Nisienlakhawm, in nuom si nawh."
38,"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.","En ta u, in in chu a ruoka mâksan cheuin a um tah."
39,"For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.","Ka hril cheu hi, ‘Lalpa hminga hung chu inpâkin um raw se,’ in ti hmakhat chun tuta hnung in mi hmu nâwk ta naw ding a nih,” a ta."
