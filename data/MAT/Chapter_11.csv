1,"And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities.","Chun, Isûn a inchûktir sâwm le pahni hai chu thu a pêk zo phingleh chutaka inthawkin an khuohaia inchûktir le thu hril dingin a fe tah a."
2,"Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples","Chun, Johanin Krista thilthaw- hai chu intângna inah a lo hrietin a inchûktirhai ân palaitir a, a kuomah,"
3,"and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?","“A hung ding chu i ni, mi dang kan la ngai ding?” tiin."
4,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Fe nâwk ta unla, thil in hmu le in hriet hi Johan kuomah va hril ro;"
5,"the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them.","mitdelhai an mit a lo var tah, kebaihai kein an lâwn tah, phârhai an lo inthieng tah, nasêthai an na a lo var tah, mithihai keithoin an um tah, pasiehaiin Chanchin Ṭha thu hril an dawng tah."
6,"And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.","Chun, tukhawm ka chunga lungninawna hmu naw chu, a hamṭha,” tiin a lo dawn a."
7,"And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?","Chun, chuhai chu an fe phingleh, Isûn mipui kuoma chun Johan thu a hril tah a, “Ieng en dingin am thlalêrah in fe suok kha? Luong thli imût hnîng maw?"
8,"But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft raiment are in kings’ houses.","Annawleh, ieng en ding takin am in fe suok kha? Puon innêm sil maw? Ngai ta u, puon innêm silhai chu lal inahai in sawnnaw an um."
9,"But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.","Annawleh, ieng lei takin am in fe suok kha? Zâwlnei en dingin maw? A ni ngei kha, ka ti cheu hi, zâwlnei nêk khawma ropui lem,"
10,"This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before thee.","‘En ta, ka tirko i hmaah ka tir a nih. Ama chun i hmaah i lampui siem a tih,’ tia a chanchin an inziek kha ama hi a nih."
11,"Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, nuhmei sûnga insieng laiah Baptistu Johan nêka ropui lem an la suok ngai nawh, nisienlakhawm, vân rama mi chîn deu khawm ama nêkin an ropui lem sih a."
12,"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force.","Baptistu Johana inthawk tu chen hin vân ram chun thaw rakna a tuok hlak a, a thaw rakhai chun an pâwnglâk hlak."
13,For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.,"Zâwlneihai po po le Dân thu chun, Johan hung um chen khan an hril lâwk hlak a nih."
14,"And if ye are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, that is to come.","In awi nuom chun, chu chu Elija, a hung ding chu a nih."
15,"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.",Tukhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se.
16,"But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, who call unto their fellows","“Nisienlakhawm, tulai ruol- tharhai hi ieng lêm hrilkhîng ka ta? Naupang dâwr hmunahai ṭhung a, an ruolhai ko a,"
17,"and say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn.","‘Theihle kan mût pêk cheu a, in lâm si nawh a, Kan ṭap rak a, âwm in chum si nawh a,’ tihai ang hi an nih."
18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.","“Johan chu a hung a, a fâkin a dâwn nawh a, ‘Khawhri a zâwl a ni hi,’ an ta."
19,"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works.","Mihriem Naupa a hung a, a fâkin a dâwn a, ‘En ta u, bu he mi, uoin he mi, siedâwltuhai le mi suolhai ruolpa saw,’ an ti sih a. Nisien- lakhawm, Varna chu a thilthawhaiin an inthiem,” a ta."
20,"Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.","Chun, an sim naw leiin a thilmak thaw tamna tak khuohai chu a hal tah a."
21,"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.","“Korazin, i chung a rik! Bethsaida, i chung a rik! Nangnia thilmak thawa umhai kha, Tura le Sidona thaw ni sienla, saiip puon sila vut laia ṭhungin um tâng an tih."
22,"But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ti cheu hi ngaituo nia chun nangni tuor nêkin Tura le Sidon tuor chu a dân um lem a tih."
23,"And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.","Chun, nang Kapernaum, vân chena chawimawi i ni ding am a nih? Mithi khuo chenin i zu fe ding i sawnnaw. Nangmaa thilmak thawa umhai kha Sodoma thaw ni sienla, tu chen hin la um zing a tih."
24,"But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ti che hi, ngaituo nia chun i tuor nêk chun Sodom ram tuor ding chu a dân um lem a tih,” a ta."
25,"At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes:","Chu lai chun Isûn a biek a, “Aw Pa, hnuoi le vân Lalpa, nangin mi var le mi bengvârhai kuomah hieng thu hi i ip a, nautehai kuomah i phuong lei hin kân pâk che."
26,"yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.","Anih, Pa, chuong anga thaw chu i ngaiin a ṭha a nih."
27,"All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him.","Ka pain thil iengkim a mîn kawltir tah; Pa naw chun Naupa hi tukhawmin an hriet nawh. Chun, Naupa le Naupain a phuong nuom- nahai chau naw chun tukhawmin Pa chu an hriet bawk nawh."
28,"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.","“Nangni sininrim le phur rik phur po pohai, ka kuomah hung unla, keiin inchâwltir ka ti cheu."
29,"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.","Ka rîngkawl bât unla, ka kuomah inchûk ro; thuhnuoirawl le lungrila inngaitlâwmtak ka ni hi; chuongchun, in thlarau ta dingin châwlna hmûng in tih."
30,"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.","Ka rîngkawl chu ân hâwi a, ka phur khawm a zâng a nih,” a ta."
