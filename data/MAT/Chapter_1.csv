20,"But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong thu chu a ngaituo laiin, ngai ta, a mangah Lalpa vântirko a kuomah a hung inlâr a, “Josef, nang David naupa, Mari chu nuhmeia nei ṭi naw rawh; a nau vawn chu Thlarau Inthienga inthawk a nih i sawnnaw."
21,And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.,"Naupasal nei a ta, a hming chu Isu sak i tih; ama chun a mihai an thil suksuolnaa inthawkin a sandam ding a ni sih a”, a ta."
22,"Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,","Lalpain zâwlnei baua,"
23,"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us.","“Ngai ta, nunghâk inthieng chu inrâi a ta, Naupasal nei a ta; A hming dingin Immanuel sak an tih,” tia a hril kha a hung tlung theina dingin chuong po po chu a hung um a nih. (Immanuel chu, “Ei kuomah Pathien a um” tina a nih)."
24,"And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;","Chuongchun, Josef chu a in a tho a; Lalpa vântirkoin a kuoma thu a pêk ang chun a thawh a; Mari chu a nei tah a;"
25,and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.,"nisienlakhawm, naupasal a nei hmakhat chu a pâwl nawh a; chun, a hming chu ISU a sak tah a."
