1,"And he called unto him his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.","Chun, a inchûktir sâwm le pahnihai chu a ko a, anni hnawt dawk theina dingin khawhri inthiengnawhai chunga thuneina a pêk a; damnawna tinrêng le natna tinrêng sukdam theina dingin thuneina a pêk bawk a."
2,"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;","Tirko sâwm le pahni hai hming chu hieng hi an nih: A hmasataka chun Simon (Peter an ti) le a unau Andri hai, Zebedai naupa Jakob le a unaupa Johan hai;"
3,"Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphæus, and Thaddæus;","Philip le Bartholomai hai; Thoma le siedâwltu Matthai hai; Alphai naupa Jakob le Thaddai hai,"
4,"Simon the Cananæan, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.",Kanaana mi Simon le a inman- tirtu Juda Iskariot hai hi an nih.
5,"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and charged them, saying, Go not into any way of the Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the Samaritans:","Chuong sâwm le pahni hai chu Isûn a tir suok a, an kuomah thu a pêk a: “Jentailhai lampuiah fe naw unla, Samari mihai khuo hrim hrima khawm lût naw ro;"
6,but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.,"amiruokchu, Israel hnam berâm inhmanghai kuoma chun fe lem ro."
7,"And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.","Chun, in fein, ‘vân ram chu a hung hnai tah,’ tiin hril pei ro."
8,"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: freely ye received, freely give.","Damnawhai sukdam unla, mithi- hai keitho unla, phârhai sukthieng unla, khawhrihai hnawt dawk ro, a thlâwnin in hmuh a, a thlâwnin pe ro."
9,"Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;","In kâwngkhihaiah rângkachak tangka amanih, tangka manih, dâr tangka amanih chawi naw ro."
10,"no wallet for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.","Inzinna dingin mansa amanih, zakuo pahni amanih, kekawk amanih, hmawl amani khawm chawi naw ro; sinthawtu chu a fâk ding hmu tlâk a ni sih a."
11,"And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go forth.","“Chun, khaw liena manih, khaw chîna manih, in lûtna taphawta chun ân tlungtir tlâk ding cheu mi zawng dawk unla, in suok nâwk hmakhat chutaka chun tlung zing ro."
12,"And as ye enter into the house, salute it.","Chun, ina chun in lût dingin chibai bûk ro."
13,"And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.","Chun, ina mihai chu intlungtir tlâk cheu an ni chun, in thlamuongna thu chu an chungah tlung sienla; an tlâk naw ruok chun in thlamuongna thu chu in chungah hung kîr nâwk raw se."
14,"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet.","Chun, tukhawm lâwm lo cheu a, in thu khawm ngai naw taphawt chu, chu ina inthawka manih, chu khuoa inthawka manih in suok pha chun in kephaa pilvut chu thin thla ro;"
15,"Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, ngaituo nia chun chu khuohai nêk chun Sodom le Gomorra ram tuor ding chu a dân um lem a tih."
16,"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.","“Ngai ta u, satenehai laia berâm um angin ka tir cheu hi; chuongchun, rûl anga vara, vaṭhu anga pawi tâwkloin um unla."
17,"But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you;","Nisienlakhawm, mihriem lai chun fimkhur ro, rorêltuhai an in- mantir ding cheu a ni sih a, in- khâwmna inahai vuong an ti cheu a;"
18,"yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.","anih, hotuhai le lalhai hmaah annihai le Jentailhai inhriettirna dingin, keima leiin la ṭhuoi an ti cheu."
19,"But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.","Nisienlakhawm, an inmantir pha cheu khawm, ‘Iengtin am, ieng thu am ka hril ding?’ tiin lungkham naw ro; in hril ding chu a hun taka chun ân hriettir ding cheu a ni sih a."
20,"For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.","A hriltu chu nangni in ni âwm si nawh a, in Pa Thlarau nangnia thu hriltu khan a hril lem ding a nih."
21,"And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.","“Chun, sukhlum dingin unaupa le unaupa inmantir an ta, pa khawmin a nau inmantir bawk a tih; nauhai khawmin an nu le pahai do an ta, insukhlumtir bawk an tih."
22,"And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.","Keia hming leiin mi po po theida nîng in tih; nisienlakhawm, a tâwp chena tuor pei chu, chu ngei chu sandamin um a tih."
23,"But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.","“Chuongchun, hi khuoa hin an suknawmna pha cheu, khaw dangah tlân san ro; titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Mihriem Naupa a hung hmain Israel khuohai chu fang suok naw ti niu."
24,"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.",“Inchûktir a inchûktirtu chung- ah a um nawh; suok khawm a pu chungah a um bawk nawh.
25,"It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household!","Inchûktir chu inchûktirtu anga a hung um le, suok chu a pu anga a hung um chu a hun deh. In neitupa hman Beelzebub an ti chun, a sûnghai chu an va ti nasa awm deh e!"
26,"Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.","“Chuongchun, anni chu ṭi naw unla; inlang lo dinga thup hmang iengkhawm a um si nawh a; hriet naw dinga ip iengkhawm a um bawk nawh."
27,"What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the house-tops.","Inthima ka hril cheu hi varah hril ro, na bula in hriet hi in chunga chuongin tlânginsampui ro."
28,"And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.","“Chun, taksa sukhluma thlarau sukhlum thei nawhai chu ṭi naw unla, Hremhmuna thlarau le taksa sukbo thei ruok chu ṭi ro."
29,Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father:,"Chawngzawng pahni dâr tang- ka pakhatin an zawr hlak a ni naw am a nih? nisienlakhawm, anni laia pakhat khawm in Pa boin hnuoiah tla naw ni."
30,but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.,In samzai chen khawm hi tiem vawng a nih in sawnnaw.
31,Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.,"Chuleichun, ṭi naw ro; chawngzawng tamtak nêkin in hlu lem a nih."
32,"Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.","“Chuongchun, mihai hmaa a mi ṭan taphawt chu, ka Pa vâna mi hmaah ṭan vêng ka tih."
33,"But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.","Nisienlakhawm, tukhawm mi- hai hmaa a mîn phat taphawt chu, ka Pa vâna mi hmaah inphat vêng ka tih."
34,"Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.","“Khawvêla hin inremna inlêng- tir dinga hung am ka nih mi sâwn naw ro; inremna inlêngtir dinga hung ka ni nawh a, kâwlhnâm inlêngtir dinga hung ka ni lem."
35,"For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law:","Mi a pa indotir dingin, naunu a nu indotir dingin, mo le a pi indotir dinga hung ka nih in sawnnaw."
36,and a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.,Mi a hmêlmahai chu ama sûnghai laia mi ngei nîng an tih.
37,He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.,"“Tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih keia nêka hmangai lem chu ka mi ni tlâk a ni nawh; tukhawm naupa amanih, naunu amanih keia nêka hmangai lem chu ka mi ni tlâk a ni nawh."
38,"And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.",Tukhawm a kraws puta mi zui naw chu ka mi ni tlâk a ni nawh.
39,He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.,Tukhawm a hringna hmu chun chân a ta; keia leia hringna chân chun hmûng a tih.
40,"He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.","“Tukhawm a lâwm cheu chu a mi lâwm a na, tukhawm a mi lâwm chu, a mi tirtu lâwm a nih."
41,He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.,"Tukhawm zâwlnei chu zâwlnei a ni leia lâwm chun, zâwlnei lâwmman hmûng a tih; tukhawm mi fel chu mi fel a ni leia lâwm chun mi fel lâwmman hmûng a tih."
42,"And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward.","Chun, tukhawm hieng mi chîn- tak laia pakhat kuoma hin, tirko a ni leia tuisik no khat chau khawm pe taphawt chun, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, a lâwmman chu chân naw tawp a tih,” a ta."
