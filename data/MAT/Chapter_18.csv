1,"In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?","Chu lai tak chun inchûktirhai chu Isu kuomah an hung a, “Vân ramah tu am ropuitak a ta?” an ta."
2,"And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them,","Ama chun, naupangte a ko a, anni lai ân ngîrtir a,"
3,"and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.","“Titakzetin ka ti cheu hi, in inleta naupangte ang in hung ni naw chun, vân ramah lût naw tawp in tih."
4,"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.","Chuongchun, tukhawm hi nau- pangte anga inngaitlâwm taphawt, ama chu vân rama chun ropuitak a tih."
5,And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me:,"Chun, tukhawm ka hming leia hieng ang naupangte pakhat lâwm taphawt chu keia mi lâwm nîng a tih."
6,"but whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.","“Amiruokchu, tukhawm hieng a mi awitu mi chînhai laia pakhat khawm sukthlu taphawt chu, a rîngah bu râwtnawina lung lientak inhlîtirin tuisuoriet inthûk laiah thlâk dai hai sien a ta dingin ṭha lem a tih."
7,Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh!,"“Tlûknahai leiin khawvêl chung a rik de! tlûknahai chu hung um ding chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, tlûkna inumtirtu chung chu a rik!"
8,"And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.","Chun, i kutin amanih, i kein amanih a sukthlûk che chun, tan la, pei dai rawh; kut pahni amanih, ke pahni amanih neia kumkhaw meia peia um nêk chun, piengsuolin amanih, ke baiin amanih hringnaa lût i ta dingin a ṭha lem."
9,"And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.","Chun, i mitin a sukthlûk che chun, khel dawk la, pei dai rawh, mit khinghni neia Hremhmun meia peia um nêk chun mit khing khat neia hringnaa lût i ta dingin a ṭha lem."
10,"See that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.","“Hieng mi chîn laia pakhat khawm hi hmusit naw dingin fîmkhur ro; an vântirkohaiin vânah ka Pa vâna mi hmêl an hmu rawp hlak ti ka hril cheu hi,”"
11,,[Bohmanghai sandam dingin Mihriem Naupa hi a hung a nih.]
12,"How think ye? if any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which goeth astray?","“Ieng angin am in ngai a? Mi tukhawmin berâm za nei sienla, an laia pakhat invâk hmang sienla, sâwmkuo le pakuo chu mâksan a, tlânghaiah hang fein, ân hmang chu a zawng naw ding am a nih?"
13,"And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, a hmu nâwk hlau chun, sâwmkuo le pakuo ân vâk hmang nawhai chunga nêk chun a chungah lâwm lem a tih."
14,"Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.","Chuong ang bawkin, hieng mi chînhai laia pakhat bohmang khawm hi in Pa vâna mi dit zâwng a ni nawh."
15,"And if thy brother sin against thee, go, show him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.","“Chun, i unauin i chungah thil suksuol ta sienla, fe la, ama le nang chau hrietah a suolnaa chun kâwk rawh, i thu a ngai chun i unau chu i hne ni tâng a tih."
16,"But if he hear thee not, take with thee one or two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established.","A ngai naw ruok che chun, mi dang pakhat amanih, pahni amanih i kuomah ṭhuoi la, chuongchun, thu tinrêng chu hretu pahni amanih, pathum amanih baua sukdet a ni theina dingin."
17,"And if he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican.","Chun, anni khawm chu a ngai nuom naw chun, kohranah intlun el rawh; chun, kohran thu khawm a ngai naw chun ama chu i ta dingin Jentail le siedâwltu ang ni raw se."
18,"Verily I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.","“Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hnuoi chunga iengkhawm in phuor taphawt chu vânah phuor nîng a tih; hnuoi chunga iengkhawm in sût taphawt chu vânah sût nîng a tih."
19,"Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven.","“Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hnuoi chunga hin nangni laia mi pahni amanih an thil hni chunga an inthuruol chun, ka Pa vâna mi thawpêkin um an tih."
20,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.","Mi pahni amanih, pathum ama- nih, ka hminga an inkhâwmna taphawta chun anni lai ka um si hlak a,” a ta."
21,"Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times?","Chu lai chun Peter a hung a, a kuomah, “Lalpa, ka unauin vawi ieng zât am ka chungah thil suksuol sien la ka ngaidam ding? vawi sari chen ding am a nih?” a ta."
22,"Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.","Isûn a kuomah, “ ‘Vawi sari chen- in,’ ka ti naw che, ‘Vawi sari hmun sâwmsari chenin,’ ka ti lem che a nih."
23,"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with his servants.","“Chuleichun, vân ram chu, laltak tu amanih, a suokhai kuoma sum chanchin sukfel tumtu le chun hrilkhi a nih."
24,"And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents.","Chun, a hang sukfel hlim chun, mi pakhat talent sing khat bat a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a."
25,"But forasmuch as he had not wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.","Pêk ding a nei naw leiin, a pu chun a nuhmei leh, a inei po po leh zawra thung ding thu a pêk a."
26,"The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.","Chuongchun, a suokpa chun, ‘Pu ka chungah za la ngai phawt la, arêngin pe vawng ka ti che,’ tiin bawkkhupin chibai a bûk a."
27,"And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.","Chuongchun, suok neitupa chun a lunginsiet ta bêk bêk a, ân thlah a, a bat chu a ngaidam tah a."
28,"But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred shillings: and he laid hold on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay what thou owest.","Nisienlakhawm, chu suok chu a va fe suok a, a suok chanpui laia pakhat, a duli za battu a va hmuh a; a man a, ‘I bat kha mi pe rawh,’ tiin a rîng a rêk a."
29,"So his fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.","Chuongchun, a suok chanpui chu a bawkkhup a, ‘Ka chungah za la ngai phawt la, la pêng ka ti che,’ tiin a ngên rak a."
30,"And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay that which was due.","Nisienlakhawm, a nuom nawh a; a ibat chu a tlâk hmakhat chu intângna inah a va khum tah a."
31,"So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.","Chuongchun, a suok chanpuihai chun a thilthaw chu an hmuin, an lungngai bêk bêk a; a thilthaw po pohai chu an pu an va hril tah a."
32,"Then his lord called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me:","Chu phingleh a pu chun a ko a, a kuomah, ‘Suok rilo, i mi hni rak leiin i bat po po kha ka ngaidam che a na,"
33,"shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee?",ka lunginsiet che ang khan nang khawmin i suok chanpui i lunginsiet ve ding a ni naw am a nih?’
34,"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due.","Chun, a pu chu a lunginsen a, a ibat po po a thung hmakhat chu sawisatuhai kuomah a pêk tah a."
35,"So shall also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.","Mi tinin in lungril taka in unauhai in ngaidam naw chun, ka Pa vâna mi khawmin chuong ang bawkin in chungah thaw vêng a tih,” a ta."
