1,"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.","“Chu pha chun, vân ram chu nunghâk inthieng sâwm, an khâwnvar chawia, mo neitu tuok dinga suokhai le chun, tekhi ni tâng a tih."
2,"And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.","Anni lai chun panga an var a, panga an invêt a."
3,"For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them:",Ân vêthai chun an khâwnvarhai an chawiin a tui an chawisa si nawh a.
4,but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.,"A varhai ruok chun an khâwn- vartui bûrhaiah a tui thunin, khâwn- varhai leh an chawi a."
5,"Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.","Chun, mo neitu chu a hung intak leiin, an rêngin an lo inlusuh a, an lo in tah a."
6,"But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.","Chun, zân rila chun, ‘Ngai ta u, mo neitu chu a hung ie! a tuok dingin hung suok ro khai,’ tiin khêkri a hung um tah a."
7,"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.","Chu phingle chun nunghâk inthienghai chu an tho vawng a, an khâwnvarhai chu an siemrêl a."
8,"And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.","Chun, ân vêthai chun a varhai kuomah, ‘In khâwnvartui kha mi pe ro, kan khâwnvarhai a thi ding a nih,’ an ta."
9,"But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.","Nisienlakhawm, a varhai chun, ‘Keini le nangni ta dingin indai naw ni; a zawrtuhai kuomah fe unla, inchaw lem ro,’ tiin an dawn a."
10,"And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.","Chun, inchaw dinga an fe hmang kâr chun, mo neitu chu a hung tlung tah a; chuongchun, ân zohai chu ama le chun inneina ruoi fa dingin an lût a; chun, kawt chu an khâr tah a."
11,"Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.","Chu hnunga chun, nunghâk inthieng danghai khawm chu an hung tlung a, ‘Pu, pu, mi hawngpêk rawh,’ an ta."
12,"But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.","Ama ruok chun, ‘Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, ka hriet naw cheu a nih,’ a ta, a dawn a."
13,"Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.","Chuongchun, ngaiven ro, a ni le a hun chu in hriet si nawh a."
14,"For it is as when a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.","“Vân ram chu mi ram danga fe tâwma, ama suokhai koa, a sumhai an kuoma inkawltir ang chu a ni sih a."
15,"And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.","Suok pakhat kuomah talent nga a pêk a, suok dang kuomah talent hni, suok dang kuomah talent khat: an thaw thei tâwk ding ang sengin a pêk a; chuongchun, a fe tah a."
16,"Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.","Chun, talent nga dawngtu chu chuonghai chun a va sumdâwng nghâl tah a, talent nga dang a sukdawk tah a."
17,In like manner he also that received the two gained other two.,Chuong ang bawkin talent hni dawngtu khawm chun talent hni dang a sukdawk tah a.
18,"But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.","Talent khat dawngtu ruok chu a va feh a, hnuoi a cho a, a pu tangka chu a thup hmang ta lem a."
19,"Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.","“Chun, sâwttak hnungah chuong suokhai pu chu a hung a, an kuomah a sum chanchin a sukfel a."
20,"And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.","Chuongchun, talent nga dawng- tu chu a hung a, talent nga dang a hung chawi a, ‘Pu, nangin talent nga i mîn kawltir kha en ta, talent nga dang ka sukdawk,’ a ta."
21,"His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","A pu chun a kuomah, ‘Suok ṭha le ringum, i thaw ṭha ie! tlâwmte chungah ring i um a, tamtak chungah inumtir ka ti che, i pu lâwmnaah lût rawh,’ a ta."
22,"And he also that received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.","Chun, talent hni dawngtu khawm chu a hung a, ‘Pu, nangin talent hni i mîn kawltir kha, en ta, talent hni dang ka sukdawk,’ a ta."
23,"His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.","A pu chun a kuomah, ‘Suok ṭha le ringum, i thaw ṭha ie! tlâwmte chungah ring i um a, tamtak chungah inumtir ka ti che; i pu lâwmnaah lût rawh,’ a ta."
24,"And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;","“Chun, talent khat kawltu khawm chu a hung a, ‘Pu, mi ti kher kher i nih ti ka hriet che; i tu nawnaa khawm i sîk hlak a, i the dar nawnaa khawm în khâwm hlak a nih;"
25,"and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.","Chuongchun, ka ṭi a, ka fe a, i talent kha hnuoiah ka thup hmang a, en ta, i ta ngai kha i hmu nâwk hi,’ a ta."
26,"But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;","A pu chun a kuomah, ‘Suok suol le zawmthawpa, ka itu nawnaa khawm ka sîka, ka the dar nawnaa khawm kân khâwm ti i hriet maw?"
27,"thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.","Chuong a ni sa chun, ka tangka chu sumdâwngtuhai kuomah lo sie ding i ni ta an nâwm; chuongchun, ka hung nâwk hin ka ta hi a pung leh ka hmu nâwk ding a nih."
28,"Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.","Chuongchun, a talent khat kha lâkpêk unla, talent sâwm neitu kuomah pe ro."
29,"For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.","Tukhawm a nei taphawt chu pe sâng an ta, chuongchun, hau a tih, tukhawm, a nei naw phawt chu a nei sun khawm chu lâkpêk an tih."
30,And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.,"Chun, suok ṭhahnem naw kha tuol tieng inthima chun pei dawk ro; chutaka chun ṭap le harâwt chu um a tih,’ a ta, a dawn a."
31,"But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:","“Mihriem naupa ruok chu a vântirkohai po po leh a ropuinaa inthuoma a hung phâ chun, a ropuina ṭhungphaah ṭhung a ta;"
32,"and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;",a hmaa chun hnam tin in- khâwm an tih; berâm chingtuin kêl laia a berâmhai a ṭhe angin anni rawi chu ṭhêng a ta;
33,"and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.","berâmhai chu a changtieng sieng a ta, kêlhai ruok chu a vawi tieng sieng a tih."
34,"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:","“Chu phâ chun, Laltak chun a changtienga mihai kuomah, ‘Ka Pa vochuomhai, hung unla, khawvêl siem tîra inthawka, in ta dinga ram buotsai chu chang ro;"
35,"for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;","ka phîng a ṭâmin nangnîn fâk ding in mi pêk a, ka dang a chârin dâwn ding in mi pêk a; mikhuol ka niin in mîn tlung tir a;"
36,"naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.","saruok ka niin puon in mîn siltir a; ka damnawh a, in mi kan a, intâng inah ka umin in hung sih a,’ la tîng a tih."
37,"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?","“Chu phâ chun, mi felhai chun, ‘Lalpa, iengtik âm phîngṭâmin kan hmu che a, fâk ding kan pêk che? dangchârin kan hmu chea dâwn ding kan pêk che?"
38,"And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?",Iengtik âm mikhuolin kan hmu che a kan intlungtir che? saruokin kan hmu chea puon kan insiltir che?
39,"And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?","Iengtik âm damnawin amanih, intâng ina manih kan hmu chea i kuomah kan hung?’ tiin la dawn an tih."
40,"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto me.","Chun, Laltak chun an kuomah, ‘Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hieng ka unau chîntakhai laia mi pakhat chunga in thaw chu, ka chunga thaw in nih,’ tîn la dawn a tih.”"
41,"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:","“Chu zoa chun a vawitienga mihai kuoma khawm chun, ‘ṭawng- sephurhai, kumkhuo mei diebol le a tirkohai ta dinga an buotsaia chun mi fe hmangsan ro;"
42,"for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;","ka phîng a ṭâmin nangnîn fâk ding in mi pêk nawh a; ka dang a chârin nangnîn dâwn ding in mi pêk nawh a,"
43,"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.","mikhuol ka niin in mîn tlungtir nawh a, saruok ka niin puon in mîn siltir nawh a; damnaw le intâng ina ka umin in mi kan si nawh a,’ la tîng a tih."
44,"Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?","Chu phâ chun, anni khawmin, ‘Lalpa, iengtik âm phîngṭâmin ama- nih, dangchârin amanih, mikhuolin amanih, intâng ina manih kan hmu che a, i rawng kan bâwlpêk naw che?’ tiin la dawn an tih."
45,"Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, ‘Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hieng mi chîntak laia mi pakhat chunga in thaw naw chu ka chunga thaw naw in nih,’ tiin la dawn a tih."
46,And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.,"Chun, chuonghai chu kumkhaw hremnaah fêng an ta, mi felhai ruok chu kumkhaw hringnaah fêng an tih,” a ta."
