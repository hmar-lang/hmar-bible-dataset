6,"Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!","Hieng po pohai hin ama chunga tekhina hung hrilin, ama chunga hrilinsîm thu hrilin, “Ama ta ni si loa insukpung chu ieng chen am nei a ta?

8,"Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.","Hnam tamtak i suksiet ta leiin, mihriem thisen le Ram le khawpui le a sûnga chênghai chunga Mihriem thisen le inpâwngnêk- na thil lo thaw ta po po lei khan, Nang khawm chi a la um sun- hai po po chun sukse vêng an ti che."

10,"Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul.","Mi tamtak chu sât thlain, I insûng ta ding chun inzakna în tlun tah a; I hringna chung ngeia khawm thil i suksuol tah a nih."
11,"For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.","Banga inthawk chun lung chuhung khêksuok a ta, Thing laia tlungpûm chun a hung dawn ding a ni sih a."
12,"Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!","Khuo chu thisena indin a, Khawpui chu khawhlonaa inngîrtu chung chu a rik ie!"

14,"For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.","Tuisuoriet chu tuihaiin ân khum angin, LALPA ropuina hrietna chun hnuoi hi a suksip ding a ni sih a."
15,"Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, to thee that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!","A tuolbâwm kuoma dâwn ding pe a, Chutaka chun a tûr chu pawl a, An saruokna chu a hmu theina dinga Sukruitu chung chu a rik ie!"
16,"Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.","Ropuina dinga inzaknaasuksip i ni tah a, Nang khawma dâwn la, saruok chu ni el rawh! LALPA kut changtienga no chu i kuomah pêk nîng a ta, I ropuina chunga chun inzakna tirdakum chu um a tih!"

Milim a sunga sung le khêlhlip inchûktirtu, Milim ṭawng thei nawhai siem a, A siemtuin ama sinthaw nâk nâk a ringzoa hin, Ṭhangkâina ieng am a um a?"
19,"Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.","Thing kuoma chun, “Harrawh,” ti a, Lung kuoma chun, “Tho rawh,” titu chu a chung a rik ie! Hi hin ân chûktir ding am a nih? En ta u, rângkachak le tangkaruo inluon khum a na, Amaa hin inthuokna hrim a um dêr nawh."
20,But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.,"LALPA ruok chu a biekininthienga chun a um a, Leihnuoi po po chu a hmaah to ṭhiep raw se."
