1,The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.,Zâwlnei Habakkukin chungrikna a hmu chu:
2,"O Jehovah, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.","Aw LALPA, ka ko chein, iengchen am, Ngai loa i um ding chu? “Inpâwngnêkna” tiin ka ko che a. I sandam naw el ding chu?"
3,"Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.","Iengdinga suolnahai hi i mîn hmutirin, Iengdinga lungngaina hi i mîn entir am a na? Suksietna le inpâwngnêkna chu ka hmaa hin a um a, Insuolna a um a, indona a hung suok hlak a nih."
4,"Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted.","Chuleiin, dân chu a dul a, rorêlna chu a zîksuok thei nawh a, Mi rilohai chun mi fel chu an inhuol vêl sih a; Chuleichun, rorêlna chu a fe suol hlak a nih."
5,"Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.","Nangni hnamhai laia mihai, en ta u, Ngaisak unla, maktitakin ngaituo ro. Hril ni unla khawm in âwi nâw ding In hunahai hin sin ka thaw ding a nih."
6,"For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.","Ngai ro, Kaldaihai kân ngîr suok a nih, Hnam ti rawk rawk le khatak elhai chu. Anni chu, anni ta khawm ni lo umna hmunhai chu, Nei dingin hnuoi khang dâpin an hung a."
7,They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.,Anni chu ṭium le pangzatumtak an na; Annia inthawk chun an rorêl le inlalna chu a fe suok a.
8,"Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.","An sakawrhai chu keitêhai nêkin an hrât lem a, Zântienga satenehai nêkin ṭi an um lem a nih; An sakawr chung chuongmihai chu chapotakin an inân a; Anih, an sakawr chung chuongmihai chu hlataka inthawkin an hung a, Mupui sa baw vuong angin a vuongin an vuong a."
9,They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.,"An rêngin pâwngnêk dingin an hung a, Khawsak thli ang elin an hmêlhai chun a ngerin an nger a, Salmanhai chu phaiphin angin an lâk khâwm a."
10,"Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.","Anih, lalhai chu an nuisan a, Mi lienhai chu an ta ding chun hmusitum an nih a, Kul det tinrênghai chu an nuisan a, pilvut a sungvûmin a lâk nâwk hlak sih a."
11,"Then shall he sweep by as a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, even he whose might is his god.","Thli angin an mût a, bâwthleng an ta, Thiemnaw changin um an tih, Anni thilthawtheina ngei pathiena neituhai chu."
12,"Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction.","Aw LALPA ka Pathien, ka Mi Inthieng, Nang chu chatuona inthawk tah i ni nâwm a nih? Thi nâwng kan tih. Aw LALPA, ama chu rorêlna dingin i ruot a, Aw lungpui, nangin ama chu sukdikna dingin în ngîr a ni kha."
13,"Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;","Nang chu suolna hmûna hlak nêka mit inthieng lem nei i na, Khawhlona chu i en thei naw a nih, Chuleiin, khawhlotaka thawtuhai chu hmu zingin, Mi riloin ama nêka mi fel lem a lem zo lai khawmin, Iengdinga i tosan ṭawk ṭawk am?"
14,"and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?","Mihriemhai chu tuisuoriet ngahai anga, Thilhring bawka invâk, an chunga rorêltu nei lohai Anga siemtu chu i ni nâwm a nih?"
15,"He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.","Ama chun anni po po chu ngakuoiin a lâk a, A lênin a man tâwl a, A keihrui chun a hnûk khâwm a; Chuleichun, a hlimin a lâwm a nih."
16,"Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.","Chuongchun, a lên kuoma chun ân thâwi a, A keihrui kuoma chun riminhnik a rawh a, Anni zâra a chan chu a hung thâu a, A bu chu a hung tam leiin."
17,"Shall he therefore empty his net, and spare not to slay the nations continually?","Chuleiin, a lên chu sukruok nâwk hlakin, Hnamhai that zing el chu a ma naw ding am a nih?"
