1,"A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.",Sigionoth chunga zâwlnei Habak- kuk ṭawngṭaina chu:
2,"O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.","Aw LALPA, i ṭawng ka hriet a,ka ṭi tah a; Aw LALPA, hieng kumhai sûng hin i sinthaw chu hung sukhar rawh. Kumhai laia hin hung inhriettir la, Lunginsennaa khawm zângaina chu hre zing rawh."
3,"God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. [Selah His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.","Pathien chu Temana inthawkina hung a. Mi Inthieng chu Paran tlânga inthawkin. A ropuina chun vânhai chu ân khum a, Leihnuoi chu ân pâknain a sip a nih."
4,And his brightness was as the light; He had rays coming forth from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.,"A êngna chu var ang a na; A kuta inthawk chun varkêhai a hung suok a, A thilthawtheina inbîkna chu a um a nih."
5,"Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.",A hmaa chun hri chu a feh a; A kehaia inthawk chun meiling inling a fe suok a.
6,"He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were as of old.","A ngîr a, hnuoi chu ân hnîng a; Hnamhai chu a en a, a hnawt dar tah a; Kumkhaw tlânghai khawm chu sukdarin an um a, Chatuon muolhai chu an kûn bawk a; A lampuihai chu chatuona mi an nih."
7,I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.,Kushan puon inhai chu sukrimsika a um lai kahmuh a; Midian ram puonzârhai chu ân thin a.
8,"Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation?","LALPA chu vadunghai chungachun a lungawi naw am anih? Vadunghai chunga chun i lunginsenna chu a umin, Tuisuoriet chunga chun i lunginsenna chu a um am a nih? I sakawrhai chunga chun i chuongin, I sandamna sakawr tawlailîr- haia chun i chuong hi?"
9,Thy bow was made quite bare; The oaths to the tribes were a sure word. [Selah Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.,"I thalngul chu sukruok dêr ana; Thalhai chu a hruiah înbûk a, Nang chun leihnuoi chu vadunghaiin i thlêr tah a."
10,"The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.","Tlânghai chun an hmu cheh a,an ṭih a; Tui insawkhai khawm chu an fe hmang tah a; Li inthûk chun a râwl ânsuoh a, A kuthai chu chungtieng a phar a."
11,"The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear.","Nisa le thla chu an umnaachun an ngîr zing a, I thalhai kâp suoka umhai vara le, I fei tle zawr zawr vara chun."
12,Thou didst march through the land in indignation; Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.,"Lunginthakin ram chu i fethleng a, Lunginsenin hnamhai chu i chîl hrep a."
13,"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. [Selah","I mihai sandamna dingin i fesuok a, I hriek nâl sandamna ding chun. Mi rilo sûngkuoa inthawk chun lu chu i sukhliem a, Ring chenin a lungphûm chu i suklang tah a."
14,Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.,"A indo mihai lu chu amahmawl ngei chun i sun- thleng a, Kei mi sukdar dingin thlivir angin an hung a: An hlimna chu mi rimsi chu inrûka fâk hmang chu a nih."
15,"Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses, The heap of mighty waters.","I sakawrhai le chun tuisuoriet chu i chîl tah a, Tui nasatak umkhâwmhaichu."
16,"I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.","Ka hriet a, ka phîngsûng chuân thin a, Ka hmûrhai chu râwlria chun ân thin hlawp hlawp a; Ka ruhaia chun hmawnna a hung lût a, chuongchun, ka hmuna chun kân thin a nih; Buoina nia chun châwl kata, Mipui, sipai pâwl anga mi rûntu chunga an hung tlung pha chun."
17,"For though the fig-tree shall not flourish, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:","Theichang kûng chu pâr naw sien khawm, Grêphruia chun a ra um naw bawk sien khawm; Oliv leia sin inrimna chu hung thlâwnin, Lohai chun bu insuo naw bawk hai sien; Berâm ruol chu a ina inthawka sât thlâka umin, Bâwng ina chun bâwng ruol khawm um naw bawk hai sien khawm,"
18,"Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.","LALPAA chun hlim ka ta, Ka sandamna Pathiena chun lâwm ka tih."
19,"Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, And will make me to walk upon my high places. For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments.","Lalpa, Jehova chu ka hrâtna a na, Ka kehai chu sazukpui kehai angin a siem a, Ama chun ka bâwlhmunhaia chun mîn fetir a tih."
