1,"And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.","Chun, zîngkâr a hung ni phingleh thiempuhai chu upa- hai le Dân inchûktirtuhai le rorêltuhai po po leh an inrâwn a, Isu chu an phier a, an ṭhuoi a, Pilat kuomah an pêk nghâl tah a."
2,"And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.","Chun, Pilat chun a kuomah, “Judahai lal i ni am a nih?” tiin ân dawn a; ama chun, “I hril ang chun ka nih,” tiin a dawn a."
3,And the chief priests accused him of many things.,"Chun, thiempuhai chun kawng tamtakin an hêk a."
4,"And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.","Chuongchun, Pilatin ân dawn nâwk a, a kuomah, “Iengkhawmin i dawn naw maw? Ngai ta, an hêkna zozai che hi,” a ta."
5,But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.,"Isu ruok chun iengkhawmin a dawn ta nawh a: chuleichun, Pilat chun mak a ti hle a."
6,"Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.","Chun, Pilatin Ruoiṭhe ni chun mi intâng pakhat an ngên taphawt chu ân suopêk hlak a."
7,"And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.","Chun, mi pakhat Barabba an ti chu, helhai laia phiera intâng ve zing a na, chuonghai chun an helnaa chun tuol an that a nih."
8,And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them.,"Chun, mipuihai chu an hang feh a, an ta dinga a thawpêk hlak anga thaw dingin an ngên tah a."
9,"And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?","Chuongchun, Pilatin an kuomah, “Judahai lal hi insuopêk lang cheu in nuom am?” a ta."
10,For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.,(Thiempu lalhaiin an îtsîk leiin an hung ṭhuoi a ni ti a hriet sih a).
11,"But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.","Nisienlakhawm, Thiempu lal- hai chun mipuihai chu Barabba chu insuopêk lem dinga hni dingin an infui a."
12,"And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?","Chun, Pilat chun an kuomah, “Anleh Judahai lal in ti hi iengtin am thaw tâng ka ta?” tiin a dawn nâwk a."
13,"And they cried out again, Crucify him.","Anni chun, “Krawsah hemde rawh,” tiin an khêk nâwk a."
14,"And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.","Pilat chun an kuomah, “Iengdingin am ie? Ieng am a suksuol leh?” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, anni chu, “Krawsah hemde rawh,” tiin an khêk zuol sau a!"
15,"And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.","Chuongchun, Pilatin mipuihai suklungawi a nuom a, Barabba chu ân suopêk tah a. Chun, Isu chu a vuok zoin krawsa hemde dingin a pêk tah a."
16,"And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Prætorium; and they call together the whole band.","Chun, sipaihai chun in inhuonna sûng tuollai Praitorion an tia chun ama chu an ṭhuoi lût a, an pâwla mi po po an ko khâwm a."
17,"And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;","Chuongchun, puon sen duk an insiltir a, hlingin lukhum an phier a, an inkhumtir a."
18,"and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!","Chuongchun, “Chibai, Judahai Lal,” tiin chibai an bûk a."
19,"And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.","Chun, a lua chun luongin an vuok a, chil an sâk khum a, dingṭhaṭhuonin chibai an bûk a."
20,"And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.","Chun, nuiza siemnaa an hmang zo chun, puon sen duk chu an hlîp a, ama puon an insiltir nâwk a. Krawsah hemde dingin an ṭhuoi suok tah a."
21,"And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.","Chun, mi invâk mei mei pakhat, rama inthawka hung, Simon Kurinia um, Alexander le Rufa pa chu a kraws puttu dingin an man a."
22,"And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.","Chun, Isu chu Golgotha hmunah an ṭhuoi a, (chu chu “Luru hmun” tina a nih)."
23,And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.,"Chun, uoin murra le pawl an pêk a,nisienlakhawm, a lâk nuom nawh a."
24,"And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.","Chun, krawsah an hemdeh a, an chang ding hrietna dingin, aisânin a silfênhai chu an insem a."
25,"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.","Chun, Isu an hemde hun chu vairik lai a nih."
26,"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.","Chun, a hêkna lekha a chungah an ziek a, “JUDAHAI LAL,” tiin."
27,"And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.","Chun, ama ruol chun suom- hmang pahni an hemde veh a, a chang- tieng pakhat, a vawitieng pakhat."
28,,"[Pathien Lekhathu, “Bawsetu- hai leh tiemsain a um tah” ti kha a hung tlung tah a.]"
29,"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,","Chun, mi fe vêl po chun an lu thinin, “A hei! nang Pathien biekin ṭhiek a, ni thum kâra bâwl nâwktu,"
30,"save thyself, and come down from the cross.","insukdam la kraws lêra kha hung ṭum ta la,” tiin an ti el a."
31,"In like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.","Chuong ang bawkin thiempu lalhai chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai leh, anni lai chun ti elin, “Mi dang hman a sukdam hlak a, ama ân sukdam thei si nawh a."
32,"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.","Ei hmuh a, ei awi theina dingin Krista, Israelhai lal chu, tuhin kraws lêra inthawkin hung ṭum ta sienla,” an ta. Chun, ama ruola an hemde vehai khawm chun ama chu an hal a."
33,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.","Chun, nisa inding huna chun, zânbu suong pha chenin khawvêl a hung inthim ta vawng a."
34,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?","Chun, zânbu suong phâ chun Isu chu râwl inringtakin, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabakthani?” tiin a khêk suok a. (Chu chu “Ka Pathien, ka Pathien, iengdinga i mi mâksan?” tina a nih)."
35,"And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.","Chun, a kuoma ngîr ṭhenkhat chun chu chu an hrietin, “Ngai ta u, Elija a ko a nih,” an ta."
36,"And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.","Chun, mi pakhat a tlân a, sponj uoin thûra inchie sipin, hmawl lêrah a târ a, a hang indâwntir a. “Hun raw se, ama la thla dingin Elija a hung am en ei tiu,” an ta."
37,"And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.","Chun, Isu chu râwl inringtakin a khêk a, a thlarau ân thla tah a."
38,And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.,"Chun, Pathien biekina puonzâr chu a chungtienga inthawkin a mawng tlung rakin a lo inthlêr suo tah a."
39,"And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.","Chun, a hmaa sipai za hotu ngîr chun, a thlarau chuonga ân thla a hmu chun, “Hi mipa hi Pathien Naupa a ni ngei el,” a ta."
40,"And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;","Chun, nuhmeihai khawm hlataka thlîrin an um a; chuhai lai chun, Mari Magdalin hai, Mari, Jakob chîn le Jose nu hai dâm, le Salomi hai an ṭhang a, (chuonghai chu Galili rama a um laia ama zuia a rawng bâwlpêk hlak hai chu an nih);"
41,"who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.",nuhmei dang tamtak Jeru- salema ama ruola hang fe vehai chu an ṭhang bawk a.
42,"And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,","Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun Inringlâwk ni a ni leiin (chu chu Châwlni hmaa ni hi a nih),"
43,"there came Joseph of Arimathæa, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.","Josef Arimathaia mi, rorêltu inzaum, Pathien ram beisei ve mi bawk, a hung a, huoitakin Pilat kuomah a lût a, Isu ruong chu a hni tah a."
44,"And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.","Chuongchun, Pilatin a thi vak chu mak a ti hle a; sipai za hotu chu a ko a, a thina a sâwt ta amanih ti ân dawn a."
45,"And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.","Chun, sipai za hotu baua thu a hriet phing chun a ruong chu Josef kuomah a pêk a."
46,"And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.","Chun, ama chun puon innêm ân châwk a, ama chu a lâk thlâk a, puon innêm chun a tuom a, thlân, lung inkerkuoah ân zâl a, thlân kawtkhâr chu lungin ân del a."
47,And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.,"Chun, Mari Magdalin le Josef nu Mari chun an inzâlna chu an hmu zing a."
