1,"And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.","Chun, dîl râl, Gerasin mihai ram chu an hung tlung a."
2,"And when he was come out of the boat, straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,","Chun, lawnga inthawka a suok chau chun mi pakhat, khawhri inthieng naw iman thlâna inthawka hung suok chun ân tuokpui tah a;"
3,"who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain;","chu mipa chun thlâna dâm chun umna a nei hlak a, tukhawmin khaidiet khawmin an khit thei ta nawh a;"
4,"because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him.","kawlhai le khaidiethai khawmin an khit rawp ta hlak a, anachu khaidiethai dâm chu a keitan a, kawlhai dâm khawm chu a sukbawng pei hlak a; tukhawmin an sukdawl zo nawh a."
5,"And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.","A sûn a zânin thlânahai le tlângahai chun a khêk hlak a, lung dâm khawmin ân ât rawp hlak a."
6,"And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him;","Chun, hlataka inthawkin Isu chu a hei hmu phingleh a tlân a, chibai a va bûk a."
7,"and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.","Chun, râwl inringtaka khêkin, “Isu, Pathien Chunghnungtak Nau- pa, kei le nang ieng am ei inzâwlna a um a? Mi sawisa naw hrâm dingin Pathien hmingin ka ngên ṭal che a nih,” a ta."
8,"For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man.","(Isu chun a kuomah, “Nang khawhri inthieng naw, mihriem sûnga hi suok rawh,” a lo ti nghâl tah a.)"
9,"And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many.","Chun, Isu chun, “I hming ieng am a na?” tîn ân dawn a. Ama chun a kuomah, “Ka hming chu Nuoia a nih, tamtak kan ni sih a,” a ta."
10,And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.,"Chun, chu rama inthawk chun anni tir hmang lo dingin Isu kuomah a ngên ṭal tah a."
11,Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding.,"Chun, chutaka tlâng panga chun vawk ruol tamtak an tlah a."
12,"And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.","Chun, khawhri inthieng nawhai chun, “Vawkhai kuoma sawn mîn fêtir rawh; an sûnga kan lût theina dingin,” tiin a kuomah an ngên a."
13,"And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, in number about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea.","Ama chun a phal pêk a. Chuongchun, khawhri inthieng naw- hai chu an suok a, vawkhai sûnga chun an lût a, chuongchun, vawk ruol chu (sâng hni lai an na) rawlah an tlân thlah a, dîlah an tlân lût a; chuongchun, dîla chun tui an inhâk hlum tah a."
14,"And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass.","Chun, a vâituhai chu an tlân a, khuo le lohaia dâm chun an hril a. Chun, “Ieng am a ni ta leh?” tia en dingin an hung khâwm tâwl a."
15,"And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him that had the legion: and they were afraid.","Chun, Isu kuom an hung tlung a, khawhri iman, nuoia iman kha, puon sila, lungril ngai puta ṭhung an hmuh a, chuongchun, an ṭi tah a."
16,"And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.","Chun, a hretuhai chun khawhri imanpa chunga thil hung tlung zie le, vawk chanchinhai chu chuonghai kuoma chun an lo hril a."
17,And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.,"Chun, chuonghai chun Isu chu an rama inthawka suok dingin an ngên tah a."
18,"And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him.","Chun, lawnga a chuong ding lai takin, khawhri imanpa khan Isu kuoma um zing a ngên a."
19,"And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and how he had mercy on thee.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn a phal nawh a, a kuomah, “I ina i ruolhai kuomah fe la, Lalpain thil a thawpêk che hi a ropuizie le a lunginsietzie che hi va hril rawh,” a ti ta lem a."
20,"And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.","Chuongchun, a feh a, Dekapoli khuohaia chun Isûn a ta dinga thil a thawpêkhai ropuizie chu a khêk vêlpui tah a; chun, mi po po chun mak an ti hle a."
21,"And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea.","Chun, Isu chu lawnga râl khing tieng a hung kai nâwk chun, mipui nasatak a kuomah an hung khâwm a, ama chu dîl panga chun a um a."
22,"And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jaïrus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet,","Chun, inkhâwmna hotuhai laia mi pakhat, a hming Jaira chu a hung a, Isu a hmu phingleh a ke bulah a bawkkhup a,"
23,"and beseecheth him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: I pray thee, that thou come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.","“Ka naunu naupangte a thi vâng vâng a, a hung hara, a hung dam theina dingin, hunga a chunga i kut innghat dingin ka ngên che,” tiin a ngên ṭal a."
24,"And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.","Chuongchun, Isu chu ama le chun an va feh a, chun, mipui nasatakin an zui a, an hneng sup sup a."
25,"And a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,","Chun, nuhmei pakhat kum sâwmpahni thipûtin a damnawh a,"
26,"and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,","dâktawr tamtak kuomah nasa- takin a tuor tah a, a nei po po khawm chu a sêng zo tah a, ṭhathnem nêkin a zuol deu deu lem a."
27,"having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.","Chu minu chun Isu chanchin a lo hriet a, a hnungah mipui lai chun a hung a, a puon chu a them a,"
28,"For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole.","“A puon chau khawm them lang sukdamin um el ka tih,” a ti lungril a nih."
29,And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.,"Chuongchun, kârloin a thipût chu a hung bo nghâl tah a, a natna chu sukdam a ni tah ti a taksa chun ân hriet tah a."
30,"And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power proceeding from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?","Chun, Isu chun a sûnga thil- thawtheina chu a suok ti a lo hriet a, mipui lai chun a ngha vêl nghâl tah a, “Tu am a na ka puon them kha?” a ta."
31,"And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?","Chun, a inchûktirhai chun a kuomah, “Mipuiin an hneng sup sup che hi i hmu nghâl a, ‘Tu am a na a mi them,?’ iengtiziea ti am i na?” an ta."
32,And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.,"Chun, ama chun a themtu chu hmu tumin a en vêl a."
33,"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chun a chunga Isu thil thawzie chu hrein ṭi le inthin pumin a hung a, a hmaah a bawkkhup a, a kuomah thu indik- takin a hril vawng tah a."
34,"And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Ka naunu, i ringna hi i dampui a nih, lungmuongtakin fe la, i natna chu lo dam sawng ta raw se,” a ta."
35,"While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Teacher any further?","A la ṭawng zing laiin in- khâwmna in hotu ina inthawkin mi an hung a, “I naunu a thi tah, ieng- dingin am inchûktirtu hi la suksâwl rawp i ta?” an ta."
36,"But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.","Isu ruok chun, an thu hril chu ngaisak loin inkhâwmna in hotu kuoma chun, “Ṭi naw, awi el rawh,” a ta."
37,"And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.","Chun, Peter hai, Jakob hai, Jakob unau Johan hai chau naw chu tukhawm ama zui ve a phal ta nawh a."
38,"And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and many weeping and wailing greatly.","Chun, inkhâwmna in hotu in chu an va tlung a, Isu chun an lo buoi mur mur le, an lo ṭap veng vung a, an khêk tuor tuor chu a va hmuh a."
39,"And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth.","Chun, a va lût chun, an kuomah, “Iengdinga inri veng vunga ṭap am in na? naupang chu a thi nawh, a in lem a nih,” a ta."
40,"And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was.","Anni hlak chun an nuisan el a; ama hlak chun an rêngin a hnawt dawk a, naupang nu le pa le a kuoma umhai chu a ṭhuoi a, naupang umnaa chun a va lût a."
41,"And taking the child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.","Chun, naupang kut chu a chel a, a kuoma chun, “Talitha kumi,” a ta. Chu chu, “Bawinu tho rawh ka ti che,” tina a nih."
42,"And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement.","Chun, naupangnu chu a hung tho a, a fe thei nghâl tah a; ama chu kum sâwmpahni mi a ni hrim tah a. Chun, anni chun namênin mak an ti nawh a."
43,And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that something should be given her to eat.,"Chun, amân an kuomah, “Hi hi tukhawmin hre naw raw hai se,” a ti tlat a, chun fâk ding pêk ding thu a pêk tah a."
