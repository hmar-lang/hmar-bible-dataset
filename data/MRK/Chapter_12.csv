1,"And he began to speak unto them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.","Chun, tekhithuin an kuomah a hril tah a, “Tuin amanih grêp huon a siem a, palin ân huon a, grêp sâwrna ding khur a cho a, in insâng a bâwl a, lo enkawltuhai kuomah thlo hlaw dingin a pêk a, ram dangah a fe tah a."
2,"And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard.","Chun, a lo pha chun huona ra chu a chanâi lo enkawltuhai kuoma va la dingin lo enkawltuhai kuoma chun suok pakhat a tir a."
3,"And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.","Chun, chu mipa chu an lo man a, an vuok a, kut ruokin an infetir tah a."
4,"And again he sent unto them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully.","Chun, suok dang an kuoma chun a tir nâwk a; chu khawm chu a lu an lo sukpawp a, inzakumtakin an lo sawisah a."
5,"And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some.","Chun, suok dang a tir nâwk pei a, chu mipa chu an lo sukhlum a. Suok dang tamtak khawm aṭhen an lo vuok a, aṭhen an lo sukhlum a."
6,"He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.","Chun, pakhat, naupa dittak chu a la nei a, ‘Ka naupa hi chu inza êm naw ni hai am,’ tiin ama chu a nuhnungtakah an kuomah a tir a."
7,"But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong lo en- kawltuhai chun, ‘Hi mipa hi rohluotu ding chu a nih; that ei tiu khai; chuongchun, a ro hluo dinghai hi ei ta a ni el ding a nih,’ an in tih a."
8,"And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard.","Chuongchun, ama chu an lo man a, an sukhlum a, grêp huona inthawk chun an the suok tah a."
9,"What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.","Chuongchun, huon neitu chun iengtin am hung thâwng a ta? Lo enkawltuhai chu hung sukbo a ta, huon chu mi danghai pêng a tih."
10,"Have ye not read even this scripture: The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner;","Hi Pathien Lekha Thu hi in tiem naw am a nih? ‘In bâwltuhai lung dit naw kha, Chu ngei chu a kia lung ṭhangkaitak a lo ni tah."
11,"This was from the Lord, And it is marvellous in our eyes?","Chu chu Lalpa thaw a na, Ei mithmua hin a mak a nih,’ ti hi,” a ta."
12,"And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.","Chun, ama chu man an tum tah a, nisienlakhawm, mipui an ṭi sih a, chu tekhithu chu anni demin a hril a nih ti an hriet sih a. Chuongchun, ama chu an mâksan a, an fe hmang tah a."
13,"And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk.","Chun, a thu hrila inthawka man dingin Pharisaihai le Herod pâwla tuhai amanih a kuomah an tir a."
14,"And when they were come, they say unto him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?","Chun, anni chu an hung tlung chun a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, mi indiktak i na, tukhawm pawisak chuong i nei nawh ti kan hriet a, tukhawm thlier bîk nei loin, theipatâwpin Pathien thu în chûktir hlak a. Kaisar kuoma sie chawi hi a thieng am a ni a thieng naw? kan pêk ding am a ni, kan pêk naw ding?” an ta."
15,"Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why make ye trial of me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it.","Ama ruok chun an vervêkziehai chu hre zingin, an kuomah, “Ieng- dinga in mi fie am a na? Duli hung la tu, lo en ka tih,” a ta."
16,"And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Cæsar’s.","Chuongchun, an hung lâk a. Ama chun an kuomah, “Hi hi tu lim le tu hming am a na?” a ta. Anni chun, “Kaisar,” an ta."
17,"And Jesus said unto them, Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled greatly at him.","Chuongchun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kaisar thilhai chu Kaisar kuomah pe unla, Pathien thilhai chu Pathien kuomah pe ta unla,” a ta. Chuong- chun, mak an ti bêk bêk a."
18,"And there come unto him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,","Chun, Saddukaihai, thonâwkna a um nawh tituhai chu a kuomah an hung a,"
19,"Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.","a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, Mosie- in ‘Tûkhawm a unaupân nau nei loin a nuhmei thisan sienla, a unaupa chun a nuhmei chu hluong a ta, a unaupa ta dingin suon a thla pêk ding a nih,’ tiin a mi ziekpêk a nih."
20,"There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed;","Awle, Sal sari hi an um a, a upatakin nuhmei a nei a, suon- mawngin a thih a."
21,"and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise:","Chuongchun, a pahnina chun a nuhmei chu a hluoh a, suon mawngin a thi nâwk bawk a; pathumna khawmin chuong bawk chun."
22,and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.,"Chuongchun, sal sarihai chu suon hrim hrim nei loin suon mawngin an thi vawng el tah a. A nuhnungtaka chun nuhmei khawm chu a thi tah a."
23,In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.,"Thonâwk phaleh a tu tak nuhmei am nîng a ta? An pasari chun nuhmeiin an nei seng sih a,” tiin an indawn a."
24,"Jesus said unto them, Is it not for this cause that ye err, that ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?","Isûn an kuomah, “Hi lei hin a nih in ngai suol rawp hlak, Pathien Lekha Thu le Pathien thil thaw theizie in hriet naw leiin."
25,"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven.","Mithi laia an tho nâwk hnungin nuhmei pasal innei ta naw nihai a, vâna vântirkohai ang an ni lem ta ding a nih."
26,"But as touching the dead, that they are raised; have ye not read in the book of Moses, in the place concerning the Bush, how God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?","Chun, mithihai keithoa an um ding thu chu, Mosie lekhabua chîmbuk thua khan Pathienin ‘Kei Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien, Jakob Pathien ka nih,’ tia a biekzie kha in tiem naw am a nih?"
27,"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: ye do greatly err.","Ama chu mithi Pathien a ni nawh a, mi hring Pathien a ni lem; in ngai suol nasa hle a nih,” a ta."
28,"And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?","Chun, Dân inchûktirtuhai laia mi pakhat a hung a, an insêl chu a lo ngai zing a, Isûn annirawi chu ṭhatakin a dawn ti a hriet a, a kuomah, “Thupêk po po lai ieng him a ropui tak a?” tîn ân dawn a."
29,"Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one:","Isun “A ropui tak chu hi hi a nih, ‘Israelhai, ngai ta u, Lalpa ei Pathien chu Lalpa pakhat chau a nih,"
30,"and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.","Lalpa i Pathien chu i lungvar po poin, i thlarau po poin, i lungril po poin, i hrâtna po poin i hmangai ding a nih,’ ti hi."
31,"The second is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.","A dawttu chu hi hi a nih, ‘Nang le nang în hmangai angin i vênghai khawm i hmangai ding a nih,’ ti hi. Hieng nêka thupêk ropui lem hrim hrim hi a um nawh,” tiin a dawn a."
32,"And the scribe said unto him, Of a truth, Teacher, thou hast well said that he is one; and there is none other but he:","Chun, Dân inchûktirtu chun a kuomah, “A ni luo ie, inchûktirtu, Ama chu pakhat chau a na, ama naw chu tukhawm dang an um nawh,"
33,"and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.","ama chu lungril po poa, hrietna po poa, hrâtna po poa hmangai a, mâni inhmangai anga vênghai hmangai chu pumrawhmang ser pêk po po le inthawina po po nêkin a ṭha lem bêk bêk ti hi i hril dik ngawt el,” a ta."
34,"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.","Chun, vartakin a dawn ti Isûn a hrietin a kuomah, “Pathien ram i hlat naw hi” a ta. Chu hnunga chun tukhawmin thu hrim hrim an indawn ngam nawh a."
35,"And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?","Chun, Isûn Pathien biekina ân chûktir laiin an kuomah, “Krista chu David naupa a nih ti Dân inchûk- tirtuhaiin iengti ziea hril hlak am an nih a?"
36,"David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.","David ngeiin, Thlarau Inthieng- in, ‘Lalpa chun ka Lalpa kuomah, Ka changtieng ṭhung rawh, I hmêlmahai i kepha hnuoia ka sie hmakhat chu,’ a tih a,"
37,David himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he his son? And the common people heard him gladly.,"“David ngei chun ama chu, ‘Lalpa,’ a ti sih a, khâwlai am a naupa ni hlak a ta?” tîn a dawn a. Chun, vântlânghai chun a thu chu lâwm- takin an ngai a."
38,"And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and to have salutations in the marketplaces,","Chun, a închûktirnaa chun, “Dân inchûktirtuhai lai hin fimkhur ro, anni chun zakuo fuol hâka lêng an nuom hlak a, dâwr hmuna chibai bûk dâm,"
39,"and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts:","inkhâwmna ina ṭhungpha ṭhatak dâm, thlaithlêng awtnaa dâm hmun ṭhatak an ngiet hlak a."
40,"they that devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation.","Hmeithai sum an fâk a, vân- tlâng hlêmna dingin sâwt tak tak an ṭawngṭai hlak a, chuonghai chun thiemnaw chang nasa zuol an tih,” a ta."
41,"And he sat down over against the treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.","Chun, thawlâwm bâwm zâwna chun a ṭhung a, thawlâwm bâwma mipuihai tangka thlâkzie chu a en a, mihausa tamtakin tamtak an thlâk a."
42,"And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.","Chun, hmeithai pasetak a hung a, dâr tangka dere pahni a thlâk a, (chu chu pawisa khat hu a nih.)"
43,"And he called unto him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury:","Isu chun a închûktirhai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, thawlâwm bâwma thlâktu po po hai nêkin hi hmeithai pasetak hin a thlâk tam lem."
44,"for they all did cast in of their superfluity; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.","Hienghai po po hin an nei chuongliem an thlâk a na, ama ruok hin chu a ditlai tak, a neisun tak, a întodelna ding po chu a thlâk a nih,” a ta."
