1,"And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,","Chun, Jerusalem an tlung tâwm a, Oliv tlânga Bethphage le Bethani khuo kâwl an tlungin, a închûktirhai laia mi pahni a tir a,"
2,"and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.","an kuomah, “In hma zâwn khuoa sawn fe unla; chun, in hei lût hlimin sabengtungte thlung, tukhawm la chuongna ngainaw va hmûng in ta; chu chu sût unla hung kei ro."
3,"And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither.","Chun, tûkhawmin, ‘A kha ieng- ding am in tih a?’ an ti cheu chun, ‘Lalpain a mamaw a nih, ahin hung insietir nâwk vak a tih,’ ti ro,” a ta."
4,"And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.","Chuongchun, an fe tah a, kawt- thlêra kawtkhâr puotienga sabeng- tungte inthlung an va hmuh a. Chun, chu chu an sût tah a."
5,"And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?","Chun, chutaka ngîr tuhai amani chun an kuomah, “Sabengtungte kha iengdinga in sût?” an ta."
6,And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.,"Chun, anni chun, Isu hril ang tak khan an kuoma chun an hril a; chuongchun, an fe an phal tah a."
7,"And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.","Chun, sabengtungte chu Isu kuomah an hung kei a, a chunga chun puonhai an phah a; chuongchun, a chungah a chuong tah a."
8,"And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.","Chun, mi tamtakin lampuia chun an puon an phah a; mi dangin loa sâwlhna an va sât a, an pha bawk a."
9,"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:","Chun, a hma tienga fehai le a hnunga hung zuituhai chun, “Hosanna, Lalpa hminga hung chu inpâkin um raw se;"
10,"Blessed is the kingdom that cometh, the kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.","Ram hung tlung ding ei Pa David ram chu, inpâkin um raw se; A chunghnungtaka khin Hosanna,” tiin an khêk a."
11,"And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.","Chun, Jerusalema Pathien biekina chun a va lût a; iengkim a en vêl zo chun; zântieng khawm a lo ni tah a, a suok a, sâwm le pahnihai leh Bethaniah an fe tah a."
12,"And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.","Chun, azîng Bethania inthawka a suok hnungin a phîng a ṭâm tah a."
13,"And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.","Chun, theichang kûng hna nei hlataka hin a hei hmuh a, “A ra ka hmu duoiin,” tiin a va feh a; a va tlung chun a hna chau naw chu iengkhawm a hmu nawh a; theichang ra pha a ni naw hrim a."
14,"And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.","Chuongchun, Isûn thing chu a biek a, “Tuta hnung kumkhaw- tluongin i ra hrim hrim tukhawmin fa ta naw raw hai se,” a ta. A închûtirhai rawi chun chu chu an hriet a."
15,"And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;","Chun, Jerusalem chu a tlung a, Pathien biekinah a va lût a, biekina iengkhat zawrtuhai le ân chawtuhai chu a hnawt suok tah a. Tangka thlengtuhai dawkânhai le, vaṭhu zawrtuhai ṭhungphahai khawm chu a nam thlûk pêk bawk a."
16,and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.,"Chun, Pathien biekina chun tukhawmin thuomhnaw an chawi thleng chu a phal ta bawk nawh a."
17,"And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.","Chun, an kuoma chun, “ ‘Ka in chu hnam tin ta dinga ṭawngṭaina in tîng an tih,’ ti ziek a ni naw am a nih? Nangni ruok chun suomhmanghai pûkin in siem lem hi,” tiin ân chûktir tah a."
18,"And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.","Chun, thiempu lalhai le Dân in- chûktirtuhai chun chu chu an hriet a, a sukbo theina ding zie an zawng a. Mipuihai po po chun a închûktirna chu mak an ti hle leiin ama an ṭi bawk si."
19,And every evening he went forth out of the city.,"Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun, Isu le a inchûktirhai chu khawpuia inthawk chun an fe suok a."
20,"And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.","Chun, zîngkâra an fe malam chun theichang kûng chu a zung chena thêm zo vawngin an hmu tah a."
21,"And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.","Chuongchun, Peterin a hriet suok nâwk a, a kuomah, “Rabbi en ta, theichang kûng ṭawngsie în phur kha a lo thêm vawng tah,” a ta."
22,"And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.","Chun, Isu chun an kuomah, “Pathienah ringna nei ro."
23,"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, tû- khawm hi tlâng kuoma hin, ‘Insawn la, tuisuorietah dehâwnin um rawh,’ tia a lungrila ringhla loa a iti chu tlung ngei a tih ti ring taphawtin an hril ang phawt chu hmûng an tih."
24,"Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.","Chuleichun, ka ti cheu hi, iengkim ṭawngṭaia in hni taphawt chu, hmusain inngai unla, chuong- chun, hmûng in tih."
25,"And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.","Chun, ṭawngṭai dinga in ngîr pha po leh tu chunga khawm thupawi ieng am a nih in nei chun ngaidam ro; vâna in Pa khawmin in bawsietnahai chu a ngaidam theina ding cheu in."
26,,"[nisienlakhawm, in ngaidam naw chun, in Pa vâna mi khawmin ngaidam bîk naw ni cheu,]” a ta, a dawn a."
27,"And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;","Chun, Jerusalem chu an tlung nâwk a; chun, Pathien biekina a lêng laiin thiempu lalhai, Dân inchûk- tirtuhai, upahai chu a kuomah an hung a,"
28,"and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?","a kuoma chun, “Tu thuin am hieng hi i thaw a na? Hienghai hi thaw dingin tuin am thu a pêk cheh a?” an ta."
29,"And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.","Isûn an kuomah, “Kei khawmin thu bau khat indawn vêng ka ti cheu; mi dawn unla, chuongchun, tu thuin am hieng hi ka thaw hril ka ti cheu."
30,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.","Johan baptisma kha vâna mi thu amani, mihriem thu? mi dawn ro,” a ta."
31,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?","Chun, an inngaituoh a, “ ‘Vâna mi thu,’ ei ti chun, ‘Ieng dinga a thu in awi naw?’ a mi ti âwm sih a."
32,"But should we say, From men—they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.","‘Mihriem thu,’ ei ti el ding am a ni chu?” an ta. Nisienlakhawm, mipui chu an ṭih a, mi po poin Johan chu zâwlnei takin an ngai tâwl sih a."
33,"And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.","Chuongchun, Isu chu an dawn a, “Kan hriet nawh,” an ta. Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Kei khawmin tu thuin am hieng hi ka thawh a, hril bîk naw ning cheuah,” a ta."
