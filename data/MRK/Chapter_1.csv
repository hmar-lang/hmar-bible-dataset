1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",Pathien Naupa Isu Krista Chanchin Ṭha hung tlung phutna chu.
2,"Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way;","Zâwlnei Isai lekhabua, “Ngai ta, ka tirko i hmaah ka tir a, Ama chun i lampui siem a tih,”"
3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;","Thlalêra mi khêk râwl chun, ‘Lalpa lamlien buotsai unla, A lampuihai suktlûn ro,’ a tih,” tia inziek ang khan."
4,"John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.","Johan, thlalêra Baptistu kha suksuolnahai ngaidamna dingin sim- na baptisma thu hrilin a hung suok a."
5,"And there went out unto him all the country of Judæa, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.","Chun, Judai rama mi po po le Jerusalema mi po pohai chu a kuomah an feh a, an suolhai thupha chawiin Jordan vadungah a kuomah baptisma an chang tâwl a."
6,"And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.","Chun, Johan chu sanghâwngsei hmul puonin ân thuom a, a kâwngah savun kâwngkhiin ân khit a, rama khuoizu le khâuṭhikṭhi buin a ring a."
7,"And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.","Chun, “Ka hnungah keia nêka ropui lem a hung zing a nih; kûna a kekawk hrui sût tlâk khawm ka ni nawh."
8,I baptized you in water; but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.,"Kei chun tuiin ka baptis hlak cheu a; ama ruok chun chu Thlarau Inthiengin a baptis ding cheu a nih,” tiin a hril a."
9,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.","Chuong nihaia chun Isu Galili rama Nazaretha inthawkin a hung a, Jordan vadungah Johan kuomah baptisma a chang tah a."
10,"And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:","Chuongchun, tuia inthawka a hung suok phingle chun, vân in- hawnga Thlarau vâṭhu angin ama chunga hung ṭum a hmu tah a."
11,"and a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.","Chun, “Nang ka Naupa dittak i nih, i chungah ka lungni bêk bêk a nih,” tiin vâna inthawkin râwl a hung suok a."
12,And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.,Chu phingleh Thlarau chun thlalêrah ama a tir suok tah a.
13,And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.,"Chuongchun, Setan ithlêmin ni sâwmli zet thlalêra chun a um a, ramsahai lai a um a, vântirkohai chun a rawng an bâwlpêk a."
14,"Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,","Chun, Johan an man hnungin Isu, Pathien Chanchin Ṭha hrilin Galili ramah a hung a;"
15,"and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.","“Hun chu a hung tlung tah a, Pathien ram khawm a hung hnai tah a, sim unla Chanchin ṭha hi ring ro,” a ti pei a."
16,"And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.","Chun, Galili dîl panghrûla a fe laiin Simon le Simon unaupa Andri chu dîla chun lên dêngin a hmuh a; nga mantu an ni hrim a."
17,"And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Mi zui ro, chuongchun, mihriem mantu dingin siem ka ti cheu,” a ta."
18,"And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.","Chuongchun, lênhai chu mâk- sanin an zui tah a."
19,"And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.","Chun, tâwite a hei fe chun, Zebedai naupa Jakob le a unau Johan chu a hmuh a, anni khawm chu an lênhai siemṭhain lawnga bawk an um a."
20,"And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.","Chun, anni khawm chu a ko nghâl tah a: chuongchun, an pa Zebedai chu inhlawfa an iruoihai kuoma chun lawngah an mâksan a, an zui tah a."
21,And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.,"Chun, Kapernaumah an va feh a, chun Châwlni chun inkhâwmna inah a lût a, ân chûktir nghâl tah a."
22,"And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.","A thu inchûktir chu mak an ti hle a, Dân inchûktirtuhai ang loa, thuneina nei taka anni ân chûktir leiin."
23,"And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,","Chun, an inkhawmna ina chun khawhri inthieng naw nei mi pakhat a lo um a;"
24,"saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.","ama chun, “Nazareth Isu, keini le nang ieng am ei inzâwlna a um a? Mi sukbohmang dingin i hung am a nih? Nang ka hriet che, Pathien mi inthieng i nih,” tiin a khêk suok nghâl tah a."
25,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.","Chun, Isûn a hal a, “To la, a sûnga inthawkin hung suok rawh,” a ta."
26,"And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.","Chun, khawhri inthieng naw chun ama a sawisah a, inringtakin a khêk a, a sûnga chu a hung suok tah a."
27,"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.","Chun, an rêngin mak an ti ta bêk bêk a, chuongchun, “Ahi ieng am a ni ta leh, inchûktirna thar a ni hi tên! Khawhri inthieng naw khawm thuneitakin thu a pêk a, a thu an awi pei el hi,” tiin an insêl a."
28,And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.,"Chun, Galili ram vêl po poah, ram tinah a chanchin ân thang nghâl tah a."
29,"And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.","Chun, inkhâwmna ina inthawk- a an suok chun, Simon le Andri inah Jakob leh Johan leh an lût a."
30,Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:,"Chun, Simon tarpinu khaw- sikin a nah a, a lo zâl a; chuongchun, a umzie chu Isu an hril nghâl tah a;"
31,"and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.","chun, ama chun, a kut a va chel a, a keitho tah a. Chuongchun, a khawsik chu a bo tah a, an rawng a bâwlpêk tah a."
32,"And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.","Chun, zântienga nisa tlâk hnung chun, damnaw po po le khaw- hri iman dâm a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a."
33,And all the city was gathered together at the door.,A khuo chun kawtkhâr bulah an hung inkhâwm tup el tah a.
34,"And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.","Chuongchun, mi tamtak natna tinrêng invawihai chu a sukdam a, khawhri tamtak a hnawt suok bawk a; khawhrihai chun ama an hriet leiin an ṭawng a phal nawh a."
35,"And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.","Chun, zîngkâr inhmatakin, khawvar hma daiin a tho a, a suok a, hmun fienrielah a va feh a, chutaka chun a ṭawngṭai a."
36,And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;,"Chun, Simon le a ruolhai chun an hnawtzui a;"
37,"and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.","ama an va hmu chun, a kuomah, “Mi po poin an zawng che i sawnnâwm ie,” an ta."
38,"And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hmun danga khaw hnaiahai dâm chun fêng ei tiu, chuonga hai khawm chun thu ka hril theina dingin, hi lei taka hung ka ni nghâl a,” a ta."
39,"And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.","Chuongchun, thu hrila, khaw- hrihai khawm hnawt suok peiin Galili ram po poa an inkhâwmna inahai chun a lût pei a."
40,"And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.","Chun, a kuomah phâr a hung a, “I nuom chun i mi sukthieng thei,” a ta, a hmaah a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a ngên rak el a."
41,"And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.","Ama chun a lo lunginsiet bêk bêk a; a hei ban a, a them a, “Ka nuom ie, sukthiengin lo um ta rawh,” a ta."
42,"And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.","Chuongchun, kârloin ân phârna chu a bo nghâl el tah a, a hung inthieng tah a."
43,"And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,","Chun, ama chu hril lo dingin a tiem tlat a, ân fetir tah a;"
44,"and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","a kuomah, “Tu kuoma khawm iengkhawm va hril dêr naw raw kha; nisienlakhawm, thiempu kuomah vân entir la, an hriet fel theina dingin Mosie thil ruothai kha i înthienna dingin vân hlân rawh,” a ta."
45,"But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu a suok a, tlânginsamin chu thu chu a phuong dar phut el tah a; chuongchun, Isu chu inphuongtakin khuo a lût thei ta nawh a; thlalêr hmunahai a um lem tah a; chun hmun tina mi a kuomah an hung hlak a."
