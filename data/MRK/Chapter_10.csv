1,"And he arose from thence, and cometh into the borders of Judæa and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes come together unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.","Chun, a tho a, chutaka inthawk chu Judai ram le Jordan râlah a fe tah a; chun, mi- puihai chu a kuomah an hung inkhâwm nâwk a, chuongchun, a thaw dân ta ang rawpin a lo inchûktir nâwk a."
2,"And there came unto him Pharisees, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? trying him.","Chun, Pharisaihai ṭhenkhat a kuomah an hung a, ama fiena dingin “Mîn a nuhmei a mâk a thieng am?” tiin an indawn a."
3,"And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Mosien iengtin am thu a pêk cheu a?” tîn a dawn a."
4,"And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.","Chun, anni chun, “Mosie chun inmâkna lekha inziekin mâk a phal hlak a nih,” an tih a."
5,"But Jesus said unto them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn an kuomah, “In lungril ngar leiin a nih in sawnnaw chu thu chu ân ziekpêk cheu chu."
6,"But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female made he them.","Nisienlakhawm, leilung insîeng tîra inthawk chun, ‘Anni chu nuhmei le pasalin a siem a nih,’"
7,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;","‘Chuleichun, pasalin a nu le pa mâksan a ta, a nuhmei chel a ta;"
8,"and the two shall become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.","chuongchun, an pahni chun tisa pumkhat lo ni tâng an tih, chuongchun, pahni an ni ta nawh a, tisa pumkhat an lo ni ta lem a nih’."
9,"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.","Chuleiin, Pathienin a izawm ta hnung chu mihriemin ṭhe naw raw se,” a ta."
10,And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter.,"Chun, ina chun, a închûk- tirhaiin chuong thu chu an indawn nâwk a."
11,"And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her:","Ama chun an kuomah, “Tû- khawm a nuhmei mah a, mi dang nei taphawt chun a nuhmei chu a retsan a nih;"
12,"and if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery.","ama khawm chun a pasal inṭhepuia mi dang a nei chun a uire a ni bawk,” a ta."
13,"And they were bringing unto him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them.","Chun, a ithem dingin naupang- tehai an hung ṭhuoi a; chun, inchûktirhai chun an lo hal a."
14,"But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn chu chu a hmuin a lung a ni naw bêk bêk a, an kuoma chun, “Naupangtêhai ka kuomah inhungtir unla, khap naw ro; Pathien ram chu hieng ang mihai ta a ni sih a."
15,"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu, tû- khawm Pathien ram chu naupang- têin a lâwm anga lâwm naw phawt chu a sûngah lût naw tawp an tih,” a ta."
16,"And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.","Chun, annirawi chu a hang kuoh a, an chungah kut innghatin mal a sâwmpêk tah a."
17,"And as he was going forth into the way, there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?","Chun, fe dinga a suok laitakin mi pakhat a kuom tieng a hung tlân a, a hmaah a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a kuom- ah, “Inchûktirtu ṭha, kumkhuoa hringna ka nei theina dingin ieng am thâwng ka ta?” tiin ân dawn a."
18,"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good save one, even God.","Chun, Isu chun a kuomah, “Iengdinga ṭha i mi ti? Mi pakhat chau naw chu tukhawm ṭha an um nawh, chu chu Pathien a nih."
19,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor thy father and mother.","Thupêkhai chu i hriet annâwm: ‘Tuol that naw, Uire naw, Inru naw, Hrietpuina inkhêl pe naw, Hlêm naw, I nu le pa chawimawi rawh,’ tihai hi,” a ta."
20,"And he said unto him, Teacher, all these things have I observed from my youth.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, chuong thu po po chu naupang chîte ka ni laia inthawkin ka zâwm hlak,” a ta."
21,"And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.","Chun, Isûn ama chu a en a, a hmangai tah a, a kuomah, “Kawng khat i la bâk, fe la, i nei taphawt zawr la, pasiehai kuomah pe rawh, chuongchun, vânah ro nei i tih; chun, hung la mi hung zui rawh,” a ta."
22,"But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one that had great possessions.","Nisienlakhawm, chuong thu lei chun a hmêl chu a hung inthim khup el a, lungzîngtakin a fe hmang tah a, sum tamtak nei mi a ni sih a."
23,"And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!","Chun, Isûn a en vêl a, a închûk- tirhai kuoma chun, “Sumhauhai chu Pathien rama lût a vân tak âwm deh e,” a ta."
24,"And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!","Chun, inchûktirhai chun, a thu hril chu mak an ti hle a, Isu ruok chun a dawn nâwk a, an kuomah, “Nauhai, sum ringhai ta ding chun Pathien rama lût a vân tak hlak deh aw;"
25,"It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","Mihausa Pathien rama a lût nêkin sanghâwngsei ṭhim naa a lût thleng awl lem a tih,” a ta."
26,"And they were astonished exceedingly, saying unto him, Then who can be saved?","Chun, anni chun mak an ti nasa bêk bêk a, a kuomah, “Anleh, tu am sandam ni thei an ti leh?” an ta."
27,"Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.","Isûn anni chu a en a, “Chu chu mihriem ta dingin thaw ruol a ni nawh a, Pathien ta ding ruok chun thaw ruol lo a ni nawh; Pathien ta dingin iengkim thaw thei a ni sih a,” a ta."
28,"Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.","Peterin a kuomah, “Ngai ta, keinîn iengkim mâksanin kan zui cheh a,” tiin a hang hril phut a."
29,"Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel’s sake,","Isu chun, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu, tûkhawm keia lei le Chanchin Ṭha leia in amanih, unaupahai amanih, farnuhai amanih, nu ama- nih, pa amanih, nauhai amanih, ram dâm khawm amanih fe san taphawt chu,"
30,"but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.","hi dam sûng ngei khawm hin, inhai, unaupahai, farnuhai, nuhai, nauhai, ramhai dâm a lêt zain, suknawmnatnahai leh, hmu naw ding tukhawm an um nawh, hun la hung tlung dinga chatuona hringna leh."
31,But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.,"Nisienlakhawm, mi tamtak a hmasataka umhai chu a nuhnung- takah la um an ta, a nuhnungtakhai khawm chu a hmasatakah la um an tih,” a ta."
32,"And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him,","Chun, Jerusalema hang fe dingin lampuiah an um a; Isu chu a hmasah a. Anni chun mak an ti hleh a, a hung zuituhai chun an ṭih a. Chun, ama chun sâwm le pahnihai chu a tumin a ṭhuoi nâwk a,"
33,"saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles:","“Ngai ta u, Jerusalemah ei hang fe nâwk ding a ni hi; Mihriem Naupa hi thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûk- tirtuhai kuoma inmantirin a la um ding a nih. Anni chun thi dingin a chungah thu rêlthlûng an ta, Jentailhai kuomah pêng an tih."
34,"and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again.","Chun, nuizat siemnân hmang an ta, chil sâk khum an ta, vuong an ta, sukhlum an tih; chun, ni thum chenah thonâwk a tih,” tiin a chunga thil hung tlung dinghai chu an kuomah a hril tah a."
35,"And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Teacher, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee.","Chun, Zebedai naupahai Jakob le Johan chun ama chu an hung hnai a, a kuomah, “Inchûktirtu, i kuomah kan hni dinghai hi i mi thawpêk kan nuom,” an ta."
36,"And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “In ta dingin ieng am thawpêk inla cheu in nuom a?” a ta."
37,"And they said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy glory.","Anni chun a kuomah, “I ropuinaa chun i changtieng pakhat, i vawitieng pakhat mîn ṭhungtir rawh aw?” an ta."
38,"But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?","Isu ruok chun an kuomah, “In hni chu in hriet naw a nih. Ka no dâwn ding chu in dâwn thei am a nih? Ka baptisma chang ding khawm chu in chang thei am a nih?” a ta."
39,"And they said unto him, We are able. And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Thei e,” an tih a. Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Ka no dâwn ding chu dâwn in ta, ka baptisma chang ding khawm chu chang vêng in tih;"
40,but to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared.,"Nisienlakhawm, ka chang- tienga manih ka vawitienga manih, ṭhung ding thu chu keia pêk ding a ni nawh a, an ibuotsaipêkhai ta ding ni lem a tih,” a ta."
41,"And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John.","Chun, sâwmhai chun chu chu an lo hrietin Jakob le Johan chunga chun an lungninaw ta bêk bêk a."
42,"And Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.","Isu ruok chun annihai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Jentailhai chunga rorêltua an iruothai chu an chungah an inlal bêk bêk hlak a, an mi lienhai chun an chungah thu an nei nasa hle ti in hriet a."
43,"But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister;","Nangni lai ruok chun chuong chu ni naw nih, tukhawm in laia mi lien ni nuom phawt chu in rawngbâwltuin a um lem ding a nih!"
44,"and whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.",Tukhawm nangni laia a hmasatak ni nuom phawt chu mi po po rawng bâwltuin a um bawk ding a nih.
45,"For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.","Mihriem Naupa meu khawm rawngbâwlpêka um dinga hung a ni nawh a, mi tamtak intlanna dinga a hringna pe ding lema hung a ni sih a,” a ta."
46,"And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timæus, Bartimæus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side.","Chun, Jeriko an hung tlung a; chun, Isu Jerikoa inthawk chun a închûktirhai leh, mipui nasatak leh a suok laiin kutdaw mitdel, Timai naupa Bartimai chu lampui sîrah a lo ṭhung a."
47,"And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.","Chuongchun, Nazareth Isu a nih ti a hriet phingin, “Isu David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin a khêk tah a."
48,"And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.","Mi tamtakin to dingin an hal a; nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “David naupa, mi lunginsiet rawh,” tiin a khêk zuol det a."
49,"And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.","Isu chu a lo ngîr a, “Ama chu hung ko ta u,” a ta. Chun, mitdel chu an ko a, a kuomah, “Lungmuongtakin um rawh, a ko che,” an ta."
50,"And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.","Chun, ama chun a puon a pei a, ân châwm tho a, Isu kuomah a feh a."
51,"And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.","Chun, Isûn ama chu a lo biek a, “I chungah ieng ang am ka thaw i nuom a?” a ta. Chun, mitdel chun a kuomah, “Rabboni, hmu thei ka nuom,” a ta."
52,"And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.","Chun, Isûn, “Fe ta rawh, i ring- na hi i dampui a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, a hmu thei nghâl tah a, lampuia chun Isu a zui tah a."
