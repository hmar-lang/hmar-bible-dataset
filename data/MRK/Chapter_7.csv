1,"And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,","Chun, Pharisaihai le Dân inchûk- tirtuhai laia mi tuhai amanih Jerusalema inthawka hunghai chu a kuomah an hung inkhâwm a."
2,"and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.",Chuonghai chun a închûktir aṭhenhaiin kut bala bei an fâk an lo hmuh tah a. Bal ti hi sâwplo tina a nih.
3,"(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders;",(Pharisaihai thurosie chu an pawm tlat leiin an kut fâitaka an sâwp naw chun an fâk ngai si nawh a.
4,"and when they come from the marketplace, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)","Chun, dâwr hmuna inthawk an inlâwi khawmin an insil naw chun an fâk ngai nawh a. Chun, thu dang tamtak pawm tlat ding an lâksâwnghai chu a um a, nohai, bêlhai, sumbêlhai sâwp hai ang hi.)"
5,"And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?","Chuongchun, Pharisaihai le Dân inchûktirtuhai chun, “Iengdinga i închûktirhai hin ruolhlui thurosie ang peia um loa kut bala bei an fâk el hlak am a na?” tiin an indawn a."
6,"And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Isai hin nangni mi vervêkhai thu a lo hrillâwk dik zet el– ‘Hi hairawi hin an bauin an mîn pâk a, An lungril ruok chun an mi hlat sih a."
7,"But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.","An inchûktirnaa mihriem thupêkhai an inchûktir leiin, An mi biek khawm hi a thlâwn el a nih,’ ti ziek ang khan."
8,"Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.","Pathien thupêkhai chu lung- kham loin, mihriem thurosie chu in chel tlat a ni hi,” a ta."
9,"And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuom- ah, “Nangni thurosiehai in pawm theina dingin Pathien thupêkhai chu in dit naw hi, rem chu in hriet ngawt hi aw!"
10,"For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:","Mosiein, ‘I nu le pa chawimawi rawh,’ ‘Tukhawm a nu amanih, a pa amanih hrilse taphawt chu thi mawl raw se,’ a ti sih a;"
11,"but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God;","nangni ruok chun hieng hin in ti hlak a, ‘Mîn a nu amanih, a pa amani kuomah, I mi sawrna ding hi Korban a ni tah,’ a ti chun, (chu chu Pathien kuoma pêk tina a nih),"
12,ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother;,"a nu amanih, a pa amani ta dingin iengkhawm a thawpêk in phal ta ngai nawh a;"
13,"making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.","in thurosie peksâwng hin Pathien thu chu in baw hmang hlak a nih; chuong ang chu tamtak in thaw hlak,” a ta."
14,"And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:","Chun, mipui chu a ko nâwk a, an kuomah, “In rêngin ka thu hi lo ngâi seng unla, a ngâi lo thiem ta u;"
15,"there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.","Mihriem puotienga inthawka a phîng sûnga lût ama sukthieng naw thei iengkhawm a um nawh, mihriem phîng sûnga inthawka hung suokhai chu mihriem sukthieng nawtu an ni lem a nih,” a ta."
16,,[Tukhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se.]
17,"And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.","Chun, mipuihai chu ina a lûtsan hnungin, a inchûktirhaiin tekhithu chu ama an indawn fel a."
18,"And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him;","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni khawm chuong ang lâwma hrietna nei naw in ni maw? Hi hi in hriet naw maw? Iengkhawm puo- tienga inthawka mihriem sûnga lût po chun ama a sukthiengnaw thei nawh;"
19,"because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? This he said, making all meats clean.","a lungrila lût loin, a phîngah a lût a, inhnâwmnaah a suok lem hlak leiin, ti hi?” a ta. (Chu chu fâkding tin rêng fâk a thieng, a tina a nih.)"
20,"And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.","Chun, ama bâwkin, “Mihriem phîng sûnga inthawka hung suok chun, chu tak chun mihriem a sukthieng naw hlak a nih."
21,"For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,","Sûng tienga um mihriem lungrila inthawkhai chun, ngaituona suol dâm a hung suok hlak nghâl a; inditna dâm, inrûkna dâm, tuol- thatna dâm, uirena dâm,"
22,"covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:","inhnarna dâm, suolna dâm, hlêmna dâm, hurna dâm, îtsîkna dâm, hrilsietna dâm, chapona dâm le invêtna dâm hi;"
23,"all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.","chuong suolhai po po chu sûngtienga inthawkin a hung suok a, mihriem chu a sukthieng naw hlak a nih,” a ta."
24,"And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.","Chun, a tho a, chutaka inthawk chun Tura le Sidon bielah a fe tah a, chun, inah a lût a, tu ihriet khawm a nuom nawh a; nisienlakhawm, ân thup thei si nawh."
25,"But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.","Chuongchun, nuhmei pakhat naunu khawhri inthieng naw iman nei chun a chanchin a lo hriet a, a ke bulah a va bawkkhup nghâl tah a."
26,"Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.","Chu nuhmei chu Grik mi a na, insiengna tieng chu Surophoiniki mi a nih. Ama chun a naunu sûnga khawhri hnawt dawk dingin a ngên a."
27,"And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Nauhai chu khawp hmasa phawt raw hai se, nauhai bei lâkpêk a, uihai kuoma pêk a mawi nawh ie,” a ta."
28,"But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Lalpa, ni chu a nih; nisienlakhawm, dawkân hnuoia uihai khawmin nauhai bei nâwi chu an fâk hlak annâwm,” tiin a dawn a."
29,"And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.","Chun, ama chun, “I thu hril lei chun fe ta raw le; khawhri chu i naunu sûnga inthawkin a suok tah,” a ta."
30,"And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.","Chun, a ina chun a fe tah a, a nau chu khawhri isuoksan zoa khuma zâl a va hmu tah a."
31,"And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.","Chun, Tura rama inthawkin a suok nâwk a, Sidon khuo sirin Dekapoli ram fe thleng peiin Galili dîl chu a tlung tah a."
32,"And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.","Chun, mi pakhat nasêt, ṭawng khawm ṭawng fel thei lo hi a kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a, a chunga a kut innghat dingin an ngên a."
33,"And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;","Chun, ama chun mipui laia chu, a khât chauin a tumin a ṭhuoi a, a kutpârhaiin a nakuo chu a khîkpêk a, chil a sâk a, a lei a them pêk a."
34,"and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.","Chun, vân tieng nghain ân thuok huoi a, a kuomah, “Ephatha,” a ta. Chu chu, “Lo inhawng rawh,” tina a nih."
35,"And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.","Chuongchun, a nahai chu a hung inhawng a, a lei khitna khawm chu a hung insût a, chiengtakin a ṭawng thei tah a."
36,"And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah tukhawm hril lo ding a ti tlat a; nisienlakhawm, a khap nasa deu leh, an khêk vêl pui nasa hman hlak a."
37,"And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.","“Ama chun iengkim ṭhatakin a thawh a; nasêt dâm a sukvarpêk a, ṭawng thei naw dâm khawm ân ṭawngtir hlak,” an ta, mak an ti nasa bêk bêk a."
