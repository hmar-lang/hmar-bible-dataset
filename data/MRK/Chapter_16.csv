1,"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.","Chun, Châwlni a hung bo chun Mari Magdalin hai, Mari Jakob nu hai, Salomi hai chun ama nâl dinga an va fe theina ding chun thil riminhnik an inchâwk a."
2,"And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.","Chuongchun, ni saria ni hma- sataka, zîngkâr nisa suok hnungin, thlân chu an va tlung a."
3,"And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?","Chun, “Thlân kawta lung chu tuin am mîn hlum hmangpêk a ta?” an inti lai zingin,"
4,"and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great.","an hang nghah a, lung chu inhlum hmang sain an hang hmu tah a, a lien hle sih a."
5,"And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.","Chun, thlân sûngah an lût a, tlangvâl pakhat puon vâr silin changtieng panga ṭhung an hmuh a; an lunginzîng tah a."
6,"And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him!","Chuongchun, ama chun an kuomah, “Lunginzing naw ro, Isu Nazareth mi, an hemde kha in zawng a ni âwm a, a thonâwk tah a, hi hin a um ta nawh; en ta u, an inzâlna hi."
7,"But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.","Nisienlakhawm, fe unla a închûktirhai le Peter kuoma chun, ‘Galili ramah in hmaa a fe ding a na; in kuoma a hril ang ngei khan chu chun hmûng in tih,’ tiin hril ro,” a ta."
8,"And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.","Chuongchun, an inthin a, an lunginzîng hle lai chun, an suok a, thlâna inthawk chun an tlân ta vang vang a, an ṭi luotin tu kuoma khawm iengkhawm an hril nawh a."
9,"Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.","[Chun, ni saria ni hmasatak, zîngkâra a thonâwk chun, Mari Magdalin, a sûnga inthawka khawhri pasari a hnawt suokpêk kuoma khan ân lâr hmasatak a."
10,"She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.","Chun, ama chu Isu umpui hlakhai kuomah a va feh a, mithi ngaia an ṭaplai chu a hril tah a."
11,"And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun, a hring nâwk a, hmu khawm a hmu ti chu an hriet dea chu an awi si nawh a."
12,"And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.","Chun, chu hnunga chun anni laia pahni ram tieng pana an fe laiin hmêl danglam putin an kuomah ân lâr nâwk a."
13,And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.,"Chun, anni chun inchûktir danghai kuomah an va hril a, anni thu khawm chu an awi chuong nawh a."
14,"And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.","Chun, chu hnung nâwka chun buthlêng an awt laiin sâwm le pakhat hai kuom ngeiah ân lâr nâwk a, a thonâwk hnunga a hmutuhai thu chu an awi naw leiin an awi nawna le an lungril ngar kawnga chun a kâwk tâwl a."
15,"And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.","Chun, an kuomah, “Khawvêl po poah fe unla, thilsiemhai po po kuomah Chanchin Ṭha hi hril ro."
16,He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.,"Awia, baptisma chang chu sandamin um an tih; a awi naw ruok chu thiemnaw changin um an tih."
17,And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;,"Chun, hieng inchiknahai hin a awituhai chu zui pei a tih: Ka hmingin khawhrihai hnawt dawk an ta, ṭawng tharhaiin ṭawng an tih."
18,"they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.","Rûlhai kut chungah dawm an ta, thina tûr iengang khawm dâwn hai sienla iengkhawm ti naw ni hai; damnawhai chungah an kut innghat an ta, dam pei an tih,” a ta."
19,"So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.","Chuongchun, Lal Isu chu an kuoma thu a hril zo chun vâna zuk ṭhuoiin a um tah a, Pathien changtieng a hang ṭhung tah a."
20,"And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.","Chuongchun, anni chu an fe suok a, ram tinah thu an hril tah a; Lalpain anni ân thlawppui a, a zuitu inchiknahai chun an thu chu a sukdet pei a, Amen]."
