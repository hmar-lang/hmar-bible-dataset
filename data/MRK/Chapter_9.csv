1,"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There are some here of them that stand by, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuomah, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, hitaka ngîr aṭhenhai hi Pathien ram chu thilthawtheina le a hung tlung an hmu hmâkhat chu thina intem tawp naw ding an um,” a ta."
2,"And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them;","Chun, ni ruk hnungin Isûn Peter hai, Jakob hai, Johan hai, chu a ṭhuoi a, a tumin tlâng insângtakah anni chau chu a hang fepui a, an hmaa chun a hmêl umzie chu a hung dang- lam tah a."
3,"and his garments became glistering, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.","Chuongchun, a silfênhai chu hnuoia puon sâwptu hrim hrimin an sâwp vâr thei naw ding khawp rakin a hung vâr a, a hung tle ta sur el a."
4,And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.,"Chun, Elija le Mosie chu an kuomah an hung inlâr a, Isu le chun an inbiek tah a."
5,"And Peter answereth and saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.","Chun, Peterin Isu a biek a, “Rabbi, ei ta dingin hitaka um hi a ṭha; bâwkte pathum khâwng ei ta, I ta dingin pakhat, Mosie ta dingin pakhat, Elija ta dingin pakhat,” a ta."
6,For he knew not what to answer; for they became sore afraid.,An ṭi bêk bêk leiin hril ding mumal a hriet si nawh a.
7,"And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear ye him.","Chun, anni chu hliein sûm a hung suok a, “Ahi ka Naupa dittak a nih, ama thu ngai ro,” a ta."
8,"And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves.","Chun, an hang en vêl vak a, Isu chau naw chu tukhawm an kuomah chun an hmu ta nawh a."
9,"And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead.","Chun, tlânga inthawk an ṭum laiin, Mihriem Naupa mithi laia a thonâwk hnunga chau naw chu an iengkhat hmuhai chu tukhawm hril naw ding a ti tlat a."
10,"And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean.","Chuongchun, chu thu chu an vawng zing a, “Mithi laia a thonâwk chu ieng tina am nîng a ta?” tiin anni rawi chu an indawn tuo hlak a."
11,"And they asked him, saying, How is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Iengdinga Dân inchûktirtuhaiin ‘Elija a hung hmasa ding a nih,’ ti am an na?” tîn an indawn a."
12,"And he said unto them, Elijah indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things: and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nought?","Ama chun an kuomah, “Elija chu hung hmasa hrim a ta, iengkim a siem ṭha ding a nih: thil tamtak tuorin, mi hmusitin a um ding a nih ti Mihriem Naupa chanchin iengtiziea ziek am an na?"
13,"But I say unto you, that Elijah is come, and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would, even as it is written of him.","Nisienlakhawm, ka hril cheu hi: Elija chu a hung ta a nih. Chun, a chanchin an ziek ang ngei khan, a chungah an nuom nuomin an thaw ta hrim bawk a,” a ta."
14,"And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them.","Chun, inchûktirhai kuom an zuk tlung chun, an vêla mipui nasatakhai le Dân inchûktirtuhaiin an lo sêl lai an zu hmuh a."
15,"And straightway all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.","Chun, mipui po po chun ama an hmu phing chun mak an ti hle a, a kuom tieng an tlân tâwl a, chibai an va bûk a."
16,"And he asked them, What question ye with them?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Annihai rawi leh ieng thu am a na in insêl?” tîn ân dawn a."
17,"And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;","Mipui laia mi pakhatin an kuomah, “Inchuktirtu, ka naupa khawhri ṭawng thei naw iman chu i kuomah ka hung ṭhuoi a."
18,"and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able.","A manna taphawtah a sukthlûk rak hlak a, chuongchun, a chil- huomhai a tlah a, a hahai a rawt a, a chêr tieu tieu a. Hnawt dawk dingin i închûktirhai ka ngên a, an thei si nawh a,” tiin ama a dawn a."
19,"And he answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him unto me.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Ruolthar ringna nei nawhai, ieng chen am in kuomah um ka ta? Ieng chen am ngai thei ka ti cheu a? Ama chu ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro,” tiin a dawn a."
20,"And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.","Chun, ama chu Isu kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; chuongchun, khawhri chun ama a hmu phingleh, naupang chu nasatakin a sawisa nghâl tah a; chuongchun, hnuoiah a tluh a, chilhuom tla reiruiin ân tleng ta tawp tawp a."
21,"And he asked his father, How long time is it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child.","Chun, ama chun a pa kuomah, “Hienga a um phutna hi ieng chen am a ni tah a?” tiin ân dawn a. Ama chun, “A naupang laia inthawkin a ni tah;"
22,"And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.","hieng hin ama sukbohmang dingin vawi tamtak meia dâm, tuia dâm a nam thlûk tah a; nisien- lakhawm, nangin iengtin amanih bêk i thaw thei chun mi lunginsiet la, mi ṭhangpui rawh,” a ta."
23,"And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth.","Chun, Isûn, a kuomah “ ‘I thei chun’ am ie? Awitu ta ding chun iengkim thaw thei a nih i sawnnaw,” a ta."
24,"Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.","Chuongchun, naupang pa chun, “Ka awi, ka awinawnaa hin mi ṭhangpui rawh,” tîn a khêk suok nghâl tah a."
25,"And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.","Chun, Isûn mipui an hung tlân khâwm chu a hmuin khawhri inthieng naw chu a hal a, a kuomah, “Nang khawhri ṭawng thei naw le nasêt, thu ka pêk che hi, a sûnga kha hung suok la, lût nâwk ta naw rawh,” a ta."
26,"And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and the boy became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead.","Chuongchun, a khêk suok a, nasataka a sawisak zo chun a hung suok tah a, chun, naupang chu thi ang elin a um a, chuongchun, mi tam lem chun, “A thi a nih,” an tih a."
27,"But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.","Isu ruok chun a kutah a chel a, a keitho a; chuongchun, a hung tho el tah a."
28,"And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, How is it that we could not cast it out?","Chun, Isu chu in a va lût chun, a închûktirhaiin, “Iengdinga keinîn kan hnawt dawk thei naw am a na?” tiin fienrielah an indawn a."
29,"And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Hieng ang hi ṭawngṭaina naw chun iengtin khawm a suok thei nawh” a ta."
30,"And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun, an fe suok a, Galili ram chu an fe thleng a, tu ihriet khawm a nuom nawh a."
31,"For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.","A închûktirhai chu a hril a, an kuomah, “Mihriem Naupa hi mi- hriemhai kuta inmantirin a um ding a nih, sukhlum bawk an ta; chun, sukhlum hnung ni thum chenah tho nâwk a tih,” a ta."
32,"But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.","Nisienlakhawm, a thu hril chu a ngaina an hriet nawh a; ama hlak chu an indawn ngam si nawh a."
33,"And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way?","Chun, Kapernaum chu an hung tlung a; chun, in sûnga chun a um laiin an kuomah, “Lampuia khan ieng thu am a na in insêl?” tîn ân dawn a."
34,"But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who was the greatest.","Nisienlakhawm, lampuia chun, “Eini lai hin tu am ropuitak a ta?” tiin an lo insêl ta leiin an to zing el a."
35,"And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.","Chun, ama chu a ṭhung a, sâwm le pahnihai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “Tûkhawmin a hmasatak ni a nuom chun, mi po po nêka nuhnungin um a ta, mi po po rawngbâwltuin a um bawk ding a nih,” a ta."
36,"And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,","Chun, naupangte a kei a, anni lai ân ngîrtir a, chun, a kutin a kuoh a, an kuomah,"
37,"Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.","“Tûkhawm keia hming leia hieng ang naupang chîte pakhat khawm lâwm chu keia mi lâwm ning a tih; tûkhawm keia mi lâwm chu a mi tirtu lâwm ni lem a tih,” a ta."
38,"John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us.","Johan chun a kuomah, “Inchûk- tirtu, tuin amanih i hmingin khawhrihai a hnawt dawk kan hmuh a, a mi zui ve naw leiin kan khap tah annaw,” a ta."
39,"But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.","Isu ruok chun, “Khap ta naw ro,tûkhawm ka hminga thilmak thaw sih a, a mi hrilse thei an um naw a nih."
40,For he that is not against us is for us.,Tûkhawm a mi kal naw chu eini tienga ṭhang a ni sih a.
41,"For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ’s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.","Tûkhawm Krista mi in ni leia tuisik no khat dâwn ding pe taphawthai cheu chu, titakzetin ka hril cheu, an lâwmman ding chu inhmang ta naw tawp a tih."
42,"And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.","“Chun, tûkhawm hieng a mi awitu chîtêhai laia pakhat chau khawm sukthlu taphawt chu, a rîngah bu râwtna lung lientak in- hlitirin tuisuorietah thlâkin um sienla, a ta dingin ṭha lem a tih."
43,"And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.","Chun, i kutin a sukthlûk che chun, tan el rawh; kut pahni neia Hremhmun mei rêm thei nawa fe nêkin, kut bûla hringnaa i lût chu i ta dingin a ṭha lem."
44,,"[Chu hmuna chun an nge a thi ngai ta nawh a, mei khawm chu a rêm ngai ta nawh.]"
45,"And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.","Chun, i kein a sukthlûk che chun tan rawh; ke pahni neia Hremhmuna peia i um nêk chun, ke baia hringnaa i lût nanga dingin a ṭha lem."
46,,"[Chu hmuna chun an nge a thi ngai ta nawh a, mei khawm chu a rêm ngai ta nawh.]"
47,"And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;","Chun, i mitin a sukthlûk che chun khel dawk el rawh, mit khingkhat neia Pathien rama lût i ta dingin a ṭha lem: mit khinghni neia Hremhmuna peia um nêk chun,"
48,"where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.","chu hmuna chun an nge a thi ngai ta nawh a, mei khawm chu a rêm ngai ta bawk nawh."
49,For every one shall be salted with fire.,Mi tin meia  sawin an um ding a ni sih a.
50,"Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.","Machi hi a ṭha; nisienlakhawm, machi hi da ta sienla, iengin am sukal nâwk an ta? Nangni ngeiah machi nei unla inngei ro,” a ta."
