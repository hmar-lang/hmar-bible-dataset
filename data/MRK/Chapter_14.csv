1,"Now after two days was the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety, and kill him:","Chun, ni hni hnung chun Fekân Ruoiṭhe le Chawl- ṭhanglo bei Ruoiṭhe a um ding a na; Thiempu lalhai le Dân inchûk- tirtuhai chun ama chu zâwra, mana sukhlum theina dingzie an zawng an zawng a."
2,"for they said, Not during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people.","Nisienlakhawm, “Ruoiṭhe sûng chu ni naw sienla, chuong naw chun vântlâng lai buoina hung um hlau rawi a tih,” an ta."
3,"And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly; and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head.","Chun, Bethania phâr Simon ina bu a fâk a, a um laiin nuhmei pakhat alabastar bûra spiknard hriek riminhnik totak chawiin a hung a, a bûr chu a sukkawi a, a lu a buok khum a."
4,"But there were some that had indignation among themselves, saying, To what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made?","Nisienlakhawm, a ṭhen chu an lung a sen tâwla, “Iengdinga hriek rim inhnik hi a sukhmangthai mei mei am a na?"
5,"For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.","Hi hriek hi duli zathum nêka tama zawr a, pasiehai kuoma pêk thei a ni sih a,” an ta. Chuongchun, a chunga chun an chier tah a."
6,"But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.","Isu ruok chun, an kuomah, “To san ro, iengdinga ama in sukbuoi am a na? ka chunga hin thil mawi tak a thaw a nih."
7,"For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have not always.","Pasiehai chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um an na, in nuom phâ phâ anni chu in lunginsiet thei annâwm, kei ruok chu kumkhuoa in kuoma um ding ka ni nawh hi."
8,She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying.,A thaw thei ang tâwk a thaw a nih; ka taksa hi phûm dingin a lo nâl lâwk a ni hi.
9,"And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.","Chuongchun, titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, khawvêl po poah, khâwlai khawm Chanchin Ṭha an hrilna taphawta chun hi nuhmei thil thaw hi ama hriet zingna dingin hril sa pei an tih,” a ta."
10,"And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve, went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them.","Chun, Juda Iskariot, sâwm le pahni laia mi pakhat khan, Isu chu an kuoma ân mantir theina dingin thiempu lalhai kuomah a va feh a."
11,"And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him unto them.","Chun, anni chun an hriet phingleh an lâwm hle a, a kuoma tangka pêk an tiem a, chuongchun, a înmantir dingzie remchâng a zawng tah a."
12,"And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples say unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover?","Chun, Chawlṭhanglo bei Ruoi- ṭhe ni hmasatak Fekan Ruoiṭhena berâmte an thatna hlak nia chun a închûktirhaiin a kuomah, “Fekân Ruoi bu i fâk theina dingin khâwlai am va siem inlang i nuom a?” an ta."
13,"And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him;","Chuongchun, a închûktirhai laia mi pahni a tir a, an kuomah, “Khawpuiah va lût unla, pasal bêla tui putin intuokpui a ti cheu a, ama chu zui lût ro."
14,"and wheresoever he shall enter in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?","Chun, a lûtna naa chun, chu in neitupa kuoma chun, ‘Inchûktirtu chun, ka închûktirhai le Fekân Ruoi bu kan fâkna ding ka mikhuol pindan chu khâwlai am a na? a tih’ ti unla."
15,And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready: and there make ready for us.,"Chuongchun, ama ngei chun pindan chunghnung lientak, thuom- hnaw umsa, inrêlsa diem, inentir a ti cheu a, chu hmuna chun ei ta dingin va siem ro,” a ta."
16,"And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.","Chun, inchûktirhai chu an feh a, khawpuia chun an va lût a; an kuoma a hril ang khan an va hmuh a, chun, Fekân Ruoi bu chu an siem tah a."
17,And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve.,"Chun, zântieng a hung ni chun, ama chu sâwm le pahnihai le chun an va fe tah a."
18,"And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you shall betray me, even he that eateth with me.","Chun, an awt a, an fâk laiin Isûn, “Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, nangni laia mi pakhat ka kuoma fa ve ngei hin mîn mantir a tih,” a ta."
19,"They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I?","Chun, an lungngai ta hle a, pakhat khatin a kuomah, “Kei am ka nih?” an ti seng a."
20,"And he said unto them, It is one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Sâwm le pahni laia mi pakhat thlênga a mîn chiepuitu hi a nih."
21,"For the Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.","Mihriem Naupa hi a chanchin an ziek ang tak khan a fe ding a nih; nisienlakhawm, Mihriem Naupa inmantirtu ding mihriem chung chu a rik; chu mipa chu lo insieng naw sienla a ta dingin ṭha lem a tih,” a ta."
22,"And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take ye: this is my body.","Chun, an fâk laiin Isûn bei a lâk a, mal a sâwm zoin a khawi a, an kuomah a pêk a, “La ro, hi hi ka taksa a nih,” a ta."
23,"And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it.","Chun, no a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin anni a pêk a, chuongchun, an rêngin an dâwn ta seng a."
24,"And he said unto them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.","Chun, ama chun, an kuomah, “Hi hi ka thisen, mi tamtak ta dinga suok ding thu thlungna chu a nih."
25,"Verily I say unto you, I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.","Titakzetin ka hril cheu hi, Pathien rama a thar ka dâwn ni a tlung hmâkhat chu, grêp hrui raa hi dâwn nâwk ta naw ning,” a ta."
26,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.","Chuongchun, hla an sak zo chun an fe suok a, Oliv tlânga chun an fe tah a."
27,"And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “In rêngin lungniloin la um vawng in tih, ‘Berâmpu vuong ka ta, berâmhai chu indar an tih,’ ti ziek a ni sih a."
28,"Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.","Nisienlakhawm, ka thonâwk hnungin Galili ramah in hmaah fêng ka tih,” a ta."
29,"But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.","Peter ruok chun a kuomah, “An rêngin lungniloin um hai sienla khawm, kei chu um naw ning,” a ta."
30,"And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that thou to-day, even this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt deny me thrice.","Nisienlakhawm, Isûn a kuom- ah, “Titakzetin ka hril che, vawisûn, vawizân le le hin âr vawi hni a khuong hmâin nangin vawi thum mîn phat i tih,” a ta."
31,"But he spake exceeding vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.","Ama ruok chun nasatakin, “I thinaa chun thi ve ding ni lang khawm, inphat naw tawp ka ti che,” a ta. Chuongchun, ama ang chun an ti ta seng a."
32,"And they come unto a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray.","Chun, Gethsemane an ti hmun chu an tlung a; chuongchun, ama chun a închûktirhai kuomah, “Ka ṭawngṭai sûng po hitaka hin lo ṭhung ro,” a ta."
33,"And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled.","Chun, Peter hai, Jakob hai, Johan hai chu a ṭhuoi a; nasatakin a thlaphângin a lunginzing ta bêk bêk a."
34,"And he saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: abide ye here, and watch.","Chuongchun, an kuomah, “Ka lungril a lungngai bêk bêk a, thipui khawp rau a nih, hitaka hin um unla inring zing ro,” a ta."
35,"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.","Chun, hmatieng chun a va fe hlek a, hnuoia chun a bawkkhup a, thaw thei ni sien chu chu hun chun ama khêl dingin a ṭawngṭai a."
36,"And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; remove this cup from me: howbeit not what I will, but what thou wilt.","“Abba, (Pa,) tinrêng i thaw thei a, hi no hi ka kuoma inthawkin la sawn rawh; nisienlakhawm, keia thu ni loin, nangma thu thu ni lem raw se,” a ta."
37,"And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch one hour?","Chun, a hung a, annirawi chu inin a hung hmuh a; chuongchun, Peter kuomah, “Simon, i in a ni maw? Dâr kâr khat khawm inring zingin i um thei naw maw?"
38,"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.","Thlêmnaa in lût nawna dingin inring zingin ṭawngṭai ro. Thlarau chun chu a pei a, tisa ruok chu a hrât naw a nih,” a ta."
39,"And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.","Chun, a va fe nâwk a, a thu hril ngai bawk chu hrilin a ṭawngṭai nâwk a."
40,"And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.","Chun, a hung kîr nâwk chun annirawi chu inin a hung hmu nâwk a, an îmu a suok hle sih a, ama dawn ngaina an hriet nawh a."
41,"And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Chun, a hung a, a vawi thumnaa chun an kuomah, “Tuhin chu in unla châwl ta ro, a hun tâwk tah! a hun chu a tlung a ni ta hi! Ngai ta u, Mihriem Naupa hi mi suolhai kutah an inmantir ding a ni hi."
42,"Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand.","Tho unla fêng ei tiu, en ta u, a mîn mantirtu ding chu a hung hnai ta hi,” a ta."
43,"And straightway, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.","Chun, a la hril lai zingin, Juda, sâwm le pahnihai laia mi pakhat chu a hung tlung nghâl el tah a, ama ruol chun thiempu lalhai le Dân in- chûktirtuhai le upahai kuoma inthawk, mipui chu, kâwlhnâm le hembâwk dâm chawiin an hung tlung bawk a."
44,"Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely.","Chun, a înmantirtu ding chun, “Ka ifâwp chu ama nîng a ta, man unla feltakin ṭhuoi hmang el ro,” tîn a hmân inchikna dâm a lo hril vawng ta sa a na."
45,"And when he was come, straightway he came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him.","Chuongchun, a tlung phingleh ama a va pan nghâl tah a, “Rabbi,” tiin a fâwp ngâwi ngâwi a."
46,"And they laid hands on him, and took him.","Chun, ama chu an chel a, an man tah a."
47,"But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.","Chun, a kuoma ngirhai laia tuin amanih a kâwlhnâm a phawi a. Thiempu Laltak suokpa chu a sât a, a nakâwr a sât thlâkpêk a."
48,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me?","Chun, Isûn anni chu a biek a, an kuomah, “Kâwlhnâmhai, hembâwk- hai chawiin suomhmang man ding ang elin, mi man dingin in hung a ni maw?"
49,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled.","Pathien biekinah ni tin inchûktirin ka um hlak a, in mi man si nawh a. Nisienlakhawm, Pathien Lekha Thu chu a hung tlung theina ding a ni hi,” a ta."
50,"And they all left him, and fled.","Chun, an rêngin ama chu an zâmsan a, an tlân hmang vawng tah a."
51,"And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on him;","Chun, tlangvâl tu amanih puon zai inhmi chaua inbelin, ama chu a zui a; chuongchun, ama chu an lo man a."
52,"but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.","Nisienlakhawm, a puon zai inhmi chu a mâksan a, ruokin a tlân hmang tah a."
53,And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.,"Chun, Isu chu Thiempu Laltak kuomah an ṭhuoi a; ama ruol chun thiempu lalhai, upahai, Dân in- chûktirtuhai po po an hung khâwm a."
54,"And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.","Chun, Peterin hlataka hin ama chu, Thiempu Laltak in in huonna sûng tuol chen chun a zui a; chuongchun, manmihai lai chun mei lum awiin a ṭhung veh a."
55,Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found it not.,"Chuongchun, Isu chu an sukhlum theina dingin thiempu lalhai le rorêltuhai po po chun ama hêkna an zawng a; an hmu si nawh a."
56,"For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together.","Mi tamtakin khêlin an hêk a; nisienlakhawm, an hêkna thuhai chu ân hmu thei si nawh a."
57,"And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,","Chun, tuhai amanih an ngîr a, khêlin an hêk a,"
58,"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.","“Hi mipa hin, ‘Hi Pathien biekin kuta bâwl hi ṭhiek ka ta, ni thum kâr chauin biekin dang, kuta bâwl naw mi bâwl ka tih,’ a ti kan hriet,” an ta."
59,And not even so did their witness agree together.,Chuong khawm chun an hêkna thu ân hmu thei chuong nawh a.
60,"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chu a ngîr suok a, Isu kuomah, “Ieng- khawmin i dawn naw maw? Hienghaiin an hêkna che hi ieng tizie am a na?” tiin ân dawn a."
61,"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and saith unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?","Ama ruok chu a to zing a, iengkhawmin a dawn nawh a. Thiempu Laltak chun a kuomah, “Krista, Inpâk tlâk Naupa chu i ni maw?” tiin ân dawn a."
62,"And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.","Chun, Isûn, “Ni e, Mihriem Naupa hi thilthawtheina chang tienga ṭhunga, vân sûm laia hung la hmûng in tih,” a ta."
63,"And the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What further need have we of witnesses?","Chun, Thiempu laltak chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a, “Hretu dang ieng dingin am ngai tâng ei ta?"
64,Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.,"Pathien a hrilsietzie hlak chu in hriet tah a; iengtin am in ngai?” a ta. Chun, an rêngin ama chu thi tlâkah an ruot tâwl tah a."
65,"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the officers received him with blows of their hands.","Chuongchun, aṭhen lem chun chil an sâk khum phut nghâl el tah a, a hmai an tuom a, an vuok a, a kuomah, “Hril rawh!” an tih a. Chun, manmihai khawm chun chel pumin an ben sawk sawk a."
66,"And as Peter was beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest;","Chun, Peter chu hnuoi tienga in inhuonna sûng tuollaia a um laiin, Thiempu Laltak rawngbâwltu nu- nghâkhai laia pakhat a hung a."
67,"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and saith, Thou also wast with the Nazarene, even Jesus.","Peter mei lum awi chu a hmuh a, a en zing a, “Nang khawm hi Isu Nazareth mi kuoma um kha i ni hi,” a ta."
68,"But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest: and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.","Ama ruok chun, “I thu hril chu ka hriet naw tawp el, a ngaina hrim hrim khawm ka hriet naw tawp el,” tîn ân phah a. Chun, tuolkawt bula chun a va suok a, chuongchun, âr a khuong tah a."
69,"And the maid saw him, and began again to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.","Chun, nunghâk chun a hmuh a, a kâwla ngîrhai kuoma chun, “Hi mipa hi anni laia mi a nih,” a ti nâwk a. Nisienlakhawm, ân pha nâwk a."
70,"But he again denied it. And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter, Of a truth thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilæan.","Chun, a nakie deu chun a kâwla ngîrhai chun Peter kuomah, “Anni laia mi i ni ngei hi maw, Galili rama mi i ni sih a,” an tih a."
71,"But he began to curse, and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.","Ama ruok chun, “Chu mihriem in hril chu ka hriet naw tawp,” tiin ṭawngsie inphurin ân khâm a."
72,"And straightway the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.","Chun, âr khuong vawi hnina chu a khuong nghâl tah a; chun, Peter chun Isûn a kuoma, “Âr vawi hni a khuong hmain nangin vawi thum mîn phat i tih,” a ti thu kha a hung hriet suok tah a. Chuongchun, chu thu chu a ngaituoin a ṭap tah a."
