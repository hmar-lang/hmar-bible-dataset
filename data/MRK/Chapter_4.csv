1,"And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.","Chun, dîl panga chun ân chûktir nâwk tah a. Chun, mipui nasatak el a kuomah an hung inkhâwm a; chuongchun, dîla chun lawngah a chuong a, a ṭhung a; mipuihai po po chu dîl panga khawmuola chun an um a."
2,"And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,","Chun, tekhithuin thu tamtak ân chûktir a, ân chûktirnaa chun,"
3,"Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:","“Ngai unla en ta u, bu chi thetu bu chi thein a feh a,"
4,"and it came to pass, as he sowed, some seed fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.","chun, a the laiin a ṭhen lampui sîrah a tlah a, vatehaiin an hung tlân zo tah a."
5,"And other fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:","Chun, a ṭhen chu pielthlêng chung, hnuoi inphânna lai a tlah a, hnuoi a sa naw leiin a mâwng nghâl tah a,"
6,"and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.","nisienlakhawm, nisa a hung insâng pha em vuoiin a um a, zung a nei naw leiin a rawp ta el a."
7,"And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.","Chun, a ṭhen chu hlohlingnei lai a tlah a, hlo chu a hung mâwng sâng a, a dîp hmang tah a, ra hrim hrim a ra ta nawh a."
8,"And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.","Chun, a ṭhen hnuoiṭhaah a tlah a, a mâwng a, ân ṭhang lien a, a ra tah a; sâwmthum dâm, sâwmruk dâm, za dâmin a pung tâwl tah a,” a ta."
9,"And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.","Chun, ama bawkin, “Tukhawm hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
10,"And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.","Chun, fienriela a um laiin a kuoma sâwm le pahnihai le um mi danghai chun tekhithuhai chu an indawn fel a."
11,"And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Pathien ram thurûk chu nangni hai hriet chu phal a na, puotienga mihai ta ding ruok chun iengkim tekhithua hril a nih;"
12,"that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.","chuongchun, ‘Hmu chu an hmu thei deh a, hriet ruok chu an hriet thei nawna ding le na ruok chun an hriet thei deh a, a ngaina ruok chu an hriet thei nawna dingin, chuong naw chun ngha kîr nawk an ta, ngaidam hung ni hlau rawi an tih,’” a ta."
13,"And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?","Chun, ama bawkin, an kuoma chun, “Hi tekhithu hi in hriet thei naw maw? Chuongchu a ni chun iengtin am tekhithu danghai po po chu hre hrim in ta?"
14,The sower soweth the word.,Bu chi thetu chun thu chu a the a nih.
15,"And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.","Chun, lampui sîra thu thênahai chu hieng hi an nih; thu an hriet phingleh Setan chun an lungrila thu thea um chu a lâkpêk nghâl hlak."
16,"And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;","Chun, chuong ang bawk chun pielthlêng chunga the chu hieng hi an nih: thu chu an hriet phinga lâwmtaka pawm nghâl el hlakhai hi;"
17,"and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.","nisienlakhawm, annia chun zung hrim an nei nawh a, sâwt nâwte chau an um a, thu leia rinumna amanih, suknawmnatna amanih a hung um phing leh an tlu nghâl el hlak a nih."
18,"And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,","Chun, mi danghai chu hlohling- nei laia the chu an nih, chuonghai chun thu chu an hriet tah a;"
19,"and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.","nisienlakhawm, khawvêl lung- khamnahai, hausakna hlêmnahai, thil dang châknahai chu a hung lût a, thu chu a dîp a, ra loin a lo um hlak."
20,"And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.","Chun, hnuoi ṭhaa thehai chu hieng hi an nih: thu chu hrea, pawm a, a lêt sâwmthum dâm, a lêt sâwmruk dâm, a lêt za dâma rahai hi,” a ta."
21,"And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, and not to be put on the stand?","Chun, ama bawkin an kuomah, “Khâwnvar chu a sienaa sie loa lei- khâwr hnuoia manih, khum hnuoia manih sie dingin an hung lâk hlak am a nih?"
22,"For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.","Inphuong naw dinga ip ieng- khawm a um nghâl nawh a, inlang lo dinga thuphmang iengkhawm a um bawk nawh."
23,"If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.","Tukhawmin hrietna dinga na nei chun hre raw se,” a ta."
24,"And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuoma chun, “In thu ngai chu nguntakin ngaituo ro, in inkhîna ngai bawkin inkhi pêk an ti cheu a, pe tam lem hman hman an ti cheu."
25,"For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.","Tukhawm a nei chu pe sâng an ta, tukhawm a nei naw chu a nei sun khawm lâkpêk an tih,” a ta."
26,"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;","Chun, ama bawkin, “Pathien ram chu hieng ang hi a nih; mîn hnuoia hin chi the sienla, zâna inin sûnah tho hlak sienla;"
27,"and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.","a umzie a hriet loin hung mâwngin hung inṭhang sienla, chuong ang chu a nih."
28,"The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.","Hnuoi hin amain ra a hung insuo hlak, a phut chun a kûng, chu zoa chun a ra, chun chu zo nâwka chun a vûia bu mal kim chu."
29,"But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.","Chun, ra chu a hung hmin pha, bu lâk a lo hun ta leiin kâwite a kei suok nghâl hlak a nih,” a ta."
30,"And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?","Chun, ama bawkin, “Pathien ram chu ieng lêm hrilkhîng ei tih aw? annawleh, ieng tekhithu lêm hril- khîng ei ta?"
31,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,","Anṭam chi mal khat hnuoia an thein, hnuoi chunga chi po po nêkin chîntak sienla khawm;"
32,"yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.","the zo hnung ruok chun a hung mâwng a, thlâi po po nêkin a hung lien lem tah a, zâr lientak tak dâm a hung nei a, chuongchun, chunglêng vatehai chu a buka chun an riek thei hlak; chuong ang chu a nih,” a ta."
33,"And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;","Chuong ang tekhithu tamtakin, an ihriet thei tâwk tâwkin, thu chu an kuomah a hril hlak."
34,and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.,Tekhithu naw chun an kuomah thu a hril ngai nawh; ama inchûk- tirhai kuoma ruok chun fienrielah iengkim a hrilfie hlak a.
35,"And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.","Chun, chu ni ma, zântieng chun ama chun an kuomah, “Râlkhing tieng sawn kai ei tiu,” a ta."
36,"And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.","Chuongchun, mipui chu mâk- sanin, ama chu a um ngai chun lawnga chun an fepui nghâl tah a. Lawng dang dâm khawm a kuomah a um a."
37,"And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.","Chun, thlipui nasatak a hung hrâng a, tuifâwnhai dâm chu lawnga chun a hung insawk lût hlawp hlawp a; chuongchun, lawng chu a hung sip vâng vâng el tah a."
38,"And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?","Chun, ama chu lukham chu khamin lawng mei tieng chun a lo in a; chun, an keitho a, a kuoma chun, “Inchûktirtu, kan bohmang hi pawi i ti nâwm a nih?” an ta."
39,"And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.","Chun, ama chu a hung har a, thli chu a hal a, dîl kuoma khawm chun, “To la, um ṭawk ṭawk rawh,” a ta. Chun, thli chu a ma a, a hung re ta ṭhup el a."
40,"And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Iengdinga chuong bêk bêka ṭi am in na? Ringna hrim in la nei naw a ni maw?” a ta."
41,"And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?","Chuongchun, ṭit namênin an ṭi ta nawh a, “Hi mipa hi tu am a ni lie? thli le dîl chen khawmin a thu an awi hi,” an inti tâwl a."
