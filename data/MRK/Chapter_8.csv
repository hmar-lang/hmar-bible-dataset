2,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:","“Tûn mipuihai hi ka kuomah ni thum an um tah a, fâk ding ieng- khawm an nei naw leiin ka lunginsiet bêk bêk a nih."
3,"and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them are come from far.","Bu ngheia an in tieng kân fetir el chun, lam kâr lakah an châu ding a ni sih a, a ṭhen lem chu an hungna a hla hle sih a,” a ta."
4,"And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?","Chun, a închuktirhai chun, “Tuin am hienghai rawi hi sukkhawp thei an ta?” tiin ama an dawn a."
5,"And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.","Chun, ama chun, “Beiphêk iengzât am in nei a?” tiin anni chu ân dawn a. Chun, anni chun, “Phêk sari,” an ta."
6,"And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.","Chun, mipuihai chu hnuoia ṭhung dingin thu a pêk a, chuong- chun, bei phêk sari chu a lâk a, lâwmthu a hril zoin a khawi a; anni laia sem dingin a închûktirhai a pêk a; chuongchun, mipui lai chun an sem tah a."
7,"And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.","Ngatê tlâwmte an nei bawk a, ama chun chu khawm chu mal a sâwm a, chuonghai khawm chu mipui laia sem ding thu a pêk a."
8,"And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.","Chuongchun, an fâk a, an khawp tâwl tah a; an fâk mahla nawi khawm chu bâwmrâng sari zet an rût sip a."
9,And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.,Anni rawi chu sâng li lai an na; ama chun anni chu ân ṭintir tah a.
10,"And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.","Chun, ama chu a închûktirhai lai lawngah a chuong nghâl tah a. Dalmanutha ram chu a tlung tah a."
11,"And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.","Chun, Pharisaihai an hung a, ama fiena dingin amaa vâna inthawka inchikna zawngin ama chu an sêl tah a."
12,"And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.","Chun, ama chu a lungrilah nasatakin ân rûm a, “Iengdinga tulaia ruoltharhai hin inchikna an zawng am a na? Titakzetin ka hril cheu, tulai ruoltharhai kuoma hin inchikna hrim hrim pêk ni naw ni,” a ta."
13,"And he left them, and again entering into the boat departed to the other side.","Chun, anni chu a mâksan a, râl khing tieng a fe tah a."
14,And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.,"Chun, a închûktirhai chun bei an chawi theinghil a, bei phêk khat chau naw chu lawnga chun bei dang hrim hrim an nei si nawh a."
15,"And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.","Chun, ama chun, “Pharisaihai chawl le Herod chawla chun invêng ṭha unla, ṭi dêkin um ro,” a ti tlat a."
16,"And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread.","Chun, anni chun, “Bei ei nei dêr nawh a,” tîn an in ngaituoh a."
17,"And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened?","Chun, Isûn chu chu a lo hriet a, an kuomah, “Bei in nei naw leisek chun iengdinga in inngaituo am? Tu khawm hin in lungrilin in la hriet rawp naw maw? In lungril chu in sukngar ta am a nih?"
18,"Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?",Mit nei zing siin in hmu nâwm a nih? Na nei zing siin in hriet nâwm a nih? In hriet zing ta naw a ni maw?
19,"When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.","Sâng nga laia bei phêk nga ka khawi lai khan a nâwi kha bâwm iengzât am in rût sip kha? In la hriet zing naw maw?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Sâwm le pahni,” an ta."
20,"And when the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up? And they say unto him, Seven.","Chun, “Sâng li laia pasari ka khawi khan a nâwi kha bâwmrâng iengzât am in rût sip a?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Bâwmrâng sari,” an ta."
21,"And he said unto them, Do ye not yet understand?","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Tu khawm hin a ngaina in la hriet rawp naw maw?” a ti tah a."

23,"And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught?","Chun, ama chun mitdel kut chu a chel a, khaw kâwl tieng a fepui a; chun, a mita chun chil a sâk a, a chungah a kut ân nghat zoin, “I hmu thei ta?” tîn ân dawn a."
24,"And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold them as trees, walking.","Chun, a hang tang a, “Mihriem chu ka hmuh a, anachu thing lâwn angin ka hmuh,” a ta."
25,"Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly.","Chun, a mita chun a kut ân nghat nawk a, chuongchun, ama chun a en zing a, a hung dam el tah a, iengkim chiengtakin a hmu thei tah a."
26,"And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.","Chun, Isu chun, “Khuoa khawm hin lût ta naw la,” tîn a in tieng ân fetir tah a."
27,"And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Cæsarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?","Chun, Isu le a închûktirhai chu an fe suok a, Philip Kaisari khawperhaia chun an feh a; chun, fe malamin a închûktirhai kuomah, “Mihaiin tu am a nih an mi tih a?” tiin ân dawn a."
28,"And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets.","Anni chun, “ ‘Baptistu Johan an ti cheh a’; mi dangin ‘Elija,’ a ṭhen ruok chun, ‘Zâwlnei tu amanih’ an ti cheh a,” tiin an hril a."
29,"And he asked them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Anleh, nangnîn tu am a nih in mi tih a?” tîn ân dawn a; Peter chun a kuomah, “Krista chu i nih,” tîn a dawn a."
30,And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.,"Chun, ama chun a chanchin thu chu tukhawm hril lo ding a ti tlat a."
31,"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.","Chun, Mihriem Naupa chun thil tamtak a tuor dingzie dâm, upahai, thiempu lalhai le, Dân inchûktir- tuhai dit nawa a um ding dâm, sukhluma a la um ding dâm, ni thum hnunga a thonâwk dingzie dâm anni ân chûktir phut tah a."
32,"And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.","Chuong thu chu chiengtakin a hril a. Chun, Peter chun ama chu a tumin a ṭhuoi a, a kâwk a."
33,"But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.","Ama ruok chu a ngha kîr a, a închûktirhai chu a en a, “Setan, ka hnungah fe rawh. Pathien thilhai ngaituo loin, mihriem thilhai i ngaituo a ni hi,” tîn Peter chu a kâwk tah a."
34,"And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples, and said unto them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.","Chun, mipuihai chu a închûk- tirhai le chun a ko a, an kuomah, “Tukhawm a mi zui nuom chun mâni inhnâwlin, a kraws putin mi zui raw se."
35,For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s shall save it.,Tukhawm ama hringna sanhim nuom chun chân a tih. Tukhawm keia lei le Chanchin Ṭha leia hringna chân chun sanhim a tih.
36,"For what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?","Mîn khawvêl hi a pumin nei sienla, a hringna chân si sienla, ieng am ṭhahnem a ta?"
37,For what should a man give in exchange for his life?,Mîn a hringna sikin ieng am pe thei a ta?
38,"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also shall be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.","Tukhawm tulai ruolthar uire le suksuol hmanghai laia kei le ka thu inzapuihai po chu, Mihriem Naupa hin vântirko inthienghai le a Pa ropuinaa inthuoma a hung pha chun, ama chu hung inzapui ve thung a tih,” a ta"
