1,And he went out from thence; and he cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him.,"Chutaka chu a suok a, a umna khuo tieng chu a tlung nâwk tah a; inchûktirhai chun an zui pei a."
2,"And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given unto this man, and what mean such mighty works wrought by his hands?","Chun, Châwlni a hung na, inkhâwmna inah ân chûktir tah a. Chuongchun, mi tamtak a thu hre hai chun, “Hi mipa hin hieng thu hi khawlaia inthawka a hriet am a na? Hi mipa kuoma pêka um hi ieng varna am a na? A kut ngeiin thil mak tak tak a thaw hi iengtizie am a na?"
3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.","Hi mipa hi Mari naupa, Jakob hai, Jose hai, Juda hai, Simon hairawi unaupa, thingrem siemtu kha a ni naw am a nih? A farnuhai khawm hitaka ei kuoma um an ni nâwm a nih?” an ta, mak an ti hle a. Chuongchun, a chungah an lungni ta nawh a."
4,"And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.","Chun, Isûn an kuomah, “Zâwlnei chu ama khuo tienga dâm, ama laibunghai lai dâm, ama ina hai dâm chau naw chun inpâk loin a um ngai nawh,” a ta."
5,"And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.","Chun, mi damnaw tlâwmte chunga kut innghata a sukdam ti chau naw chu, chu hmuna chun thil- mak dang hrim a thaw thei nawh a."
6,And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.,"An awi nawna chu mak a ti hle a. Chun, inchûktir pum peiin khuohai chu a fang vêl a."
7,"And he calleth unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;","Chun, sâwm le pahni hai chu a ko a, pahni peiin a tir suok tah a; khawhri inthieng nawhai chunga thuneina a pêk bawk a."
8,"and he charged them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse;","Chun, inzinnaa ding chun fung- hrawl chau naw chu iengkhawm– bei khawm, mansa khawm, an kâwng- khiah tangka khawm–châwi lo ding a ti tlat a,"
9,"but to go shod with sandals: and, said he, put not on two coats.","kekawk ruok chu bun ding a tih a. “Zakuo pahni hâk naw ro,” a ti bawk a."
10,"And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence.","Chun, ama bawkin an kuomah, “Khawlai khawm in tlungna ina chun chu hmuna inthawka in suok nâwk hmakhat chu, tlung zing pei ro."
11,"And whatsoever place shall not receive you, and they hear you not, as ye go forth thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them.","Chun, khâwlai khuo khawmin an lâwm naw cheu a, in thu an ngâi nawna poah, chutaka inthawka in suok pha chun, anni inhriettirna dingin in kepha hnuoia pilvut kai chu thinthla ro,” a ta."
12,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent.","Chuongchun, an fe suok a, mipuihai kuomah simna thu an hril a."
13,"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.","Khawhrihai tamtak an hnawt- suok a, damnaw tamtak khawm sahriek an nâl a, an sukdam bawk a."
14,"And king Herod heard thereof; for his name had become known: and he said, John the Baptizer is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.","Chun, lal Herod chun a lo hriet a, a hming chu a lo inthang ta sih a, “Baptistu Johan kha mithi laia inthawkin a hung tho nâwk tah a; chuleiin, chuong thilthawtheinahai chun amaa chun sin a thaw a ni chu,” a ta."
15,"But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, even as one of the prophets.","Mi dang ruok chun, “Elija a ni chu,” an ta; mi dangin, “Zâwlnei a ni chu, zâwlneihai laia pakhat ang kha,” an ta."
16,"But Herod, when he heard thereof, said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen.","Herod ruok chun a lo hrietin, “Johan, a lu ka itanpa ngei kha a hung tho nâwk a ni chu,” a ta."
17,"For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her.","Herod ngei chun a unaupa Philip nuhmei Herodi leiin mi a tir suok a, Johan chu ân mantir a, intângna inah phierin a lo khum ta sih a; Herodi chu nuhmeiin a lo nei ta leiin;"
18,"For John said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.","Johan chun Herod kuomah, “I unaupa nuhmei i nei pêk hi a thieng naw a nih,” a lo ti ta bawk a."
19,"And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;","Chuleichun, Herodi chun ama chu a ngei naw rân el a, sukhlum a nuom a; nisienlakhawm, a thei si nawh a;"
20,"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.","Herodin Johan chu mi fel le mi inthiengtak a nih ti a hriet leiin ama chu a ṭih a, a hum tlat sih a, a thu a ngai chun a lunginzîng hle hlak a: nisienlakhawm, lâwm takin a ngai hlak a."
21,"And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;","Chun, Herod chun a pieng ni champha phâk nia a mi ropuihai, sipai hotu lienhai dâm, Galili rama mi lienhai rawi ta dinga, zâna ruoi a ṭhe laiin hun remchâng a hung um tah a."
22,"and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.","Herodi naunu ngei chu a hung lût a, a lâm a, Herod le a thlaithlêng awtpuituhai chu a suklâwm tah a; chuongchun, lal chun naupangnu kuoma chun, “I dit dit mi hni rawh, pêng ka ti che,” a ta."
23,"And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.","“Iengkhawm i mi hni phawt chu, ka ram chenve rau khawm pêng ka ti che,” tiin a kuomah a lo inkhâm ta bawk a."
24,"And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer.","Chun, ama chu a suok a, a nu kuoma chun, “Ieng am hnîng ka ta?” a va ta. Chun, ama chun, “Baptistu Johan lu,” a lo ta."
25,"And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist.","Chun, ama chu inhmawtakin lal kuoma chun a va lût nghâl tah a, “Thlêngin Baptistu Johan lu i mi pêk nghâl ka nuom a nih,” tîn a hnih a."
26,"And the king was exceeding sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject her.","Chun, lal chu a lungngai ta bêk bêk el a; nisienlakhawm, ân khâm- nahai le a thlaithlêng awtpuituhai lei chun a sêl nuom nawh a."
27,"And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,","Chun, lal chun a vêngtu sipai pakhat a tir nghâl tah a, a lu chu hung lâk ding thu a pêk a. Chun, ama chun intângna ina chun a lu a va tan a,"
28,"and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.","a lu chu thlêngin a hung lâk a, naupangnu kuoma chun a pêk a, ama chun a nu kuomah a pêk a."
29,"And when his disciples heard thereof, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.","Chun, a închûktirhai chun an hriet phingleh a ruong chu an vân hlawm a, thlânah an inzâl tah a."
30,"And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught.","Chun, tirkohai chu Isu kuomah an hung inkhâwm a, iengkim an thil thaw ta hai, an thu inchûktir tahai po po chu an hril a."
31,"And he saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Nangni rawi ngawtin thlalêr hmunah a tumin hung unla, châwl phawt ro,” a ta. (Mi tamtak an insûl zut zut a, bu takngiel khawm an fâk hman nghâl nawh a.)"
32,And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart.,"Chuongchun, thlalêr tieng lawngin a tumin an va fe tah a."
33,"And the people saw them going, and many knew them, and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.","Chun, an va fe lai chu mipuihai chun an hmuh a, mi tamtakin anni chu an hriet a, khaw tina inthawkin chu hmuna chun kein an tlân khâwm a, an lo lekhal tah a."
34,"And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.","Chuongchun, ama chu a hung suok chun, mipui nasatak a hmuh a, vêngtu nei naw berâmhai ang an ni leiin a lunginsiet bêk bêk a; thu tamtak ân chûktir tah a."
35,"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent;","Chun, khuo chu a hung inhnu ta hle a, a inchûktirhai chu a kuomah an hung a, “Ahi thlalêr hmun a na, khuo khawm ân hnu ta bawk nghâl a."
36,"send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat.","Anni rawi hi ei kâwl vêl loa dâm le khuoa dâm an fâk ding ieng amanih bêk an inchâwk theina dingin infetir tâwl ta la,” an ta."
37,"But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread, and give them to eat?","Ama ruok chun an kuomah, “Nangnîn fâk ding pe ta unla,” tiin a dawn a. Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “Bei duli zahni man vân chawin fâk ding kan pêk ding am a nih?” an ta."
38,"And he saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.","Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “Beiphêk iengzât am in nei a? hung en ta u,” a ta. Chun, an nei zât an hriet phingleh, “Panga, ngatê pahni leh,” an ta."
39,And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass.,"Chun, ama chun, an rêngin hlo hring chunga chun apâwl peia inṭhungtir dingin an kuomah thu a pêk a."
40,"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.","Chun, atlarin za khat dâm, sâwmnga dâm peiin an ṭhung tâwl a."
41,"And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.","Chun, ama chun bei panga le ngatê pahni chu a lâk a, vân tieng nghain mal a sâwm a, beiphêkhai chu a khawi a, mipui chu infâktir dingin a inchûktirhai kuomah a pêk a, ngate pahni khawm chu mi po po lai chun a sem a."
42,"And they all ate, and were filled.","Chun, an rêngin an fâk a, an khawp tâwl tah a."
43,"And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes.","Chun, bei nâwi le nga nâwihai chu bâwm sâwm le pahni an rût sip a."
44,And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men.,Bei fatuhai chu patling ruok khawm sâng nga hiel an nih.
45,"And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away.","Chun, ama ngeiin mipui chu ân ṭintir sûngin râl khing tienga Bethsaidaa lo fe hmasa dingin a inchûktirhai chu lawngah ân chuong tir nghâl tah a."
46,"And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.","Chun, anni ân ṭintir hnung chun ṭawngṭai dingin tlangah a fe tah a."
47,"And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.","Chun, zântieng inhnu deu a hung ni chun lawng chu dîl lai taka chun a lo um a, ama chu a khât chauin khawmuola chun a um a."
48,"And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:","Chun, an lawng kar chu an lung a zîng hlein a hmu a, thliin aninaw tieng panga a mût leiin. Vârṭien ding lai vêlin dil chunga kea lâwnin anni tieng a hung pan a, anni chu fe khêl a tum a."
49,"but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun ama chu dîl chunga kea lâwn an hang hmu chun thlâ amanih an sâwn a, an khêk ta rak el a; an rêngin ama an hmuh a, an thlaphâng hle a."
50,"for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun anni chu a biek nghâl tah a, an kuomah, “Lungmuongtakin um ro, keima ka nih annâwm, ṭi naw ro,” a ti tah a."
51,And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves;,"Chun, lawnga chun an kuomah a hang chuong ve a, thli hrang chu a ma tah a; chuongchun, an lungril chun mak an ti hle a,"
52,"for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.","bei thu kha a ngaina an hriet- thiem si nawh a, an lungril a ngar leiin."
53,"And when they had crossed over, they came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.","Chun, râl khingtieng an kai chun Gennesaret ram, khawmuol an tlung a, vapanga chun lawng chu an thlung a."
54,"And when they were come out of the boat, straightway the people knew him,","Chun, lawnga inthawka an suok chun, mihai chun ama chu an lo hriet nghâl tah a;"
55,"and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.","chu ram vêla chun an tlân vêl ta sup sup a, a um ti an hrietna taphawta chun damnawhai dâm an zâlphaa zâl pum zingin an zâwn vêl ta ruoi el a."
56,"And wheresoever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.","Chun, khaw chînhaia dâm, khaw lienhaia dâm, lohaia dâm, khawlai a lûtna taphawta chun damnawhai chu dâwr hmuna dâm an inzâltir tâwl a; a puon hmawr bêk khawm them thei an hnih a. Chuongchun, ama tâwk po chu an dam pei tah a."
