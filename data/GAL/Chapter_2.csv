1,"Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.","Chun, kum sâwmpali ân vawi hnungin, Tita khawm chu ṭhuoi vein, Barnaba ruolin Jerusalemah ka hang fe nâwk a."
2,"And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.","Chun, hriettirna leiin ka hang feh a, Jentailhai laia Chanchin Ṭha tlâng ka însampui hlak hi anni ka hang hril a; nisienlakhawm mi lien deuhai chu a tumin ka hril a, chuong naw chun a thlâwnin tlân hlau rawi ka tih; annawleh, tlân thlâwn tah ni rawi ka tih."
3,"But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:","Nisienlakhawm, Tita ka kuoma um khawm chu, Grik mi ni sien khawm ser tan lui pêkin a um ta nawh a;"
4,"and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:","unau tehlêm, inrûka an iṭhuoi lûthaiin tan luipêk ding tihai sien khawm; chuonghai chun suoka an mi sie theina dingin Krista Isua chun zalênna kan nei hi enthlit dingin inrûkin an lût a."
5,"to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.","Nisienlakhawm, Chanchin Ṭha thutak chu in kuoma a um zing theina dingin, dârkâr khat khawm intuklûtin an thu ka zâwm nawh a."
6,"But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man’s person)—they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:","Chun, mi lien deua an iruothai lai chun, (ieng ang mi khawm ni sien la ka ta dingin a dang chuong nawh, Pathienin tûkhawm a thlier bîk nawh a) mi lien deua an iruothai chun iengkhawm an mi belsa chuong si nawh a;"
7,"but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel of the circumcision","chuong nêk hmanin Sertanhai Chanchin Ṭha Peter kuoma inkawl- tira a um angin, Sertannawhai Chanchin Ṭha ka kuomah inkawl- tirin a um ti an hriet a."
8,(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles);,"(Sertanhai tirko ni dinga Peter ta dinga thaw pêktu ngei chun, Jentailhai tirko ni dingin ka ta ding khawma a mi thaw pêk sih a.)"
9,"and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;","Lunginsietna a mi pêk chu an hrietin, Jakob hai, Kipha hai, Johan hai, bana an iruothai chun, keini Jentailhai laia fe ding le, anni po sertanhai kuoma fe dingin kei le Barnaba chu inpâwlna kut chang- tieng an mi pêk ta lem hman a."
10,only they would that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.,"Pasiehai kan ihriet chau an nuom, chu tak chu thaw ka tum tlat hrim hlak chu a nih."
11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.","Chun, Kipha chu Antiokeia a hung laiin demumtaka a um leiin, a hmai san ngeiah ka kal a."
12,"For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.","Mi tuhai amanih Jakob kuoma inthawka an hung hma chun, ama chun Jentailhai lai bu a fâk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, an hung tlung phingleh Sertan mihai chu a ṭi leiin ṭhang nâwk ta loin, ân suktum ta sih a."
13,And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.,"Juda danghai khawm an vervêk tâwl tah a; chuongchun, Barnaba meu khawm an vervêkna ṭhuoi hmangin a um ta hiel a."
14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?","Nisienlakhawm, Chanchin Ṭha thutak angin an um fel nawh ti ka hrietin, Kipha kuomah, an rênga hmaah, “Nang Juda mi ni siin, Juda anga um loin Jentail angin i um a. Iengtiziea Jentailhai chu Judahai anga în umluitir hlak am a na?” ka tih a."
15,"We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,",Keini chu Jentail mi suolhai ni loin Juda mi hrima pieng kan na;
16,"yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.","nisienlakhawm, Dân thilthaw leiin mi thiem changin a um nawh a, Isu Krista ring lei chauin thiem changin a um lem ti kan hriet sih a. Keini khawmin Dân thilthaw lei ni loin, Krista awina leia thiem changa kan um theina dingin, Krista Isu chu kan awi a nih; Dân thilthaw leiin mihriem hrim hrim thiem changin um si naw ni hai a."
17,"But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.","Kristaa thiem changa um kan tumnaa hin, keini ngei khawm mi suola ngai kan lo ni lem hlau chun, anleh, Krista chu suol sin thawtu ni el a ti?"
18,"For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.","Teu lo e, ka thil ṭhiekhai kha ka bâwl nâwk si chun, bawsetu ka nizie kân hriettir el ning a tih."
19,"For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.",Pathien tieng kawnga ka hung hring theina dingin kei chu Dân leiin Dân tieng kawngah ka thi ta sih a.
20,"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me: and that life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.","Krista kuomah hemdein ka um tah. Nisienlakhawm, ka hring a nih, kei ruok chu ka ni ta nawh a, Krista chu keimaah a hring lem a nih; chun, tuta tisaa ka hring hi ringnaa hring ka nih, Pathien Naupa, mi lunginsiettu, ka aia inpetu ringnaa chun."
21,"I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.",Pathien lunginsietna chu ka bawhmang nawh. Dân leia felna a um si chun Krista chu a thlâwnin a thi nîng a tih.
