verse_no,en,hmr
1,"For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.","Suok ni lo dingin Krista chun a mîn suoktir kha; chuongchun, ngir det unla, suok ringkawla chun intâng nâwk ta naw ro."
2,"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.","Ngai ta u, kei Paulain in kuomah ka hril hi, ser in intantir chun Krista chu in ta dingin iengkhawm ṭhahnemna ni naw ni."
3,"Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.","Anih, Dân thu po po zâwm dinga battu an nih ti, ser intantir taphawt kuomah kân hriettir nâwk a nih."
4,"Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.","Nangni Dâna thiem chang tumtuhai, Krista leh in inṭhe tah a, lunginsietna chu in tlûksan tah."
5,For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.,Keini chun Thlarau zârah ring- nain felna beiseina kan nghâk sih a.
6,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.","Krista Isua chun sertan ieng- khawm a ṭhahnem nawh a, sertan- naw khawm iengkhawm a ṭhahnem chuong nawh, ringna hmangainaa thaw ruok chu a ṭhahnem a nih."
7,Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?,"Ṭhatakin in tlân hlak kha, thutak chu in zâwm nawna dingin tuin am a hluo ta cheu a?"
8,This persuasion came not of him that calleth you.,Hi thlêmna hi a kotu cheua inthawk a ni nawh.
9,A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.,Chawl tlâwmtêin bei tlang chu a pumin a fang suok hlak.
10,"I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.","Ngaituo danglam naw ti niu ti Lalpaa chun kei chun nangni tieng ka ring cheu a nih; nisienlakhawm, a sukbuoitu cheu chu, tûkhawm ni sien la, a chunga rorêlna chu la tuor a tih."
11,"But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.","Unauhai, keiin sertan thu ka la hril rawp si chun, ieng dinga suknawmnata la um rawp am ka na? Chuong ang a ni si chun kraws insuina chu sukbo ni tâng a tih."
12,I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.,A sukbuoitu cheu chu intan thla law law sien ka nuom a nih.
13,"For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.","Nangni, unauhai, suok ni lo dinga ko in ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, suok in ni nawna chu tisa ta dinga remchângah hmang naw unla, hmangainain rawng inbâwl tuo pêk seng lem ro,"
14,"For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.","“Nangma în hmangai angin i vênghai i hmangai ding a nih,” ti thu baukhata hin Dân thu po po chu a famkim tah a ni sih a."
15,"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.","Nisienlakhawm, in inseh a, in infâk tuo si chun, in insukbohmang tuo nawna dingin fîmkhur ro."
16,"But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.","Chuongchun, hi hi ka ti a nih: Thlarauah um ro; chuongchun, tisa châkna chu in zâwm naw ding annâwm."
17,"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.","Tisa hin Thlarau dona tieng ân hâwk hlak, Thlarau khawmin tisa dona tieng ân hâwk bawk si hlak a, thil thaw in itumhai chu in thaw thei nawna dingin chuonghai chu an inkal sih a."
18,"But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.","Nisienlakhawm, Thlarau ṭhuoia in um chun, Dân hnuoia chun in um nawh."
19,"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,","Chun, tisa thilthawhai chu ân lang fel a nih; chuong chu hieng hi an nih: inditna dâm, inthiengnawna dâm, hurna dâm,"
20,"idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,","milim biekna dâm, dawithiem- na dâm, theidâna dâm, inhalna dâm, thîkna dâm, lungsenna dâm, mani- hmasielna dâm, insuktumna dâm, ring tumna dâm,"
21,"envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.","thîkthusietna dâm, zu inruina dâm, zu hmun hlimna dâm, chuong anghai chu, chuong kawnga chun kha hmaa, “Chuong ang thil thawtuhai chun Pathien ram hluo naw ni hai,” tia ka hril lâwk cheu ang khan, ka hril nâwk cheu hi."
22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,","Thlarau ra ruok chu hmangaina dâm, hlimna dâm, inremna dâm, dawtheina dâm, ngilneina dâm, ṭhatna dâm, ringumna dâm,"
23,"meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.","thuhnuoirawlna dâm, insûm- thei na dâm a ni lem: chuong ang kal zâwngin Dân thupêk hrim a um nawh."
24,And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.,"Chun, Krista Isu mihai chun tisa chu a suol ngaituona le a châknahai pumin an hemde tah."
25,"If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.","Thlaraua hring ei ni chun, Thlaraua vêk um ei tiu."
26,"Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.","Inchotuoin, in itthîktuoin inngaihlu nâwng ei tiu."
