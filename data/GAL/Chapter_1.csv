1,"Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),","Paula, tirko (mihriemhai tir suok ni loa, mihriemhai zârah ni bawk loa, Isu Krista le mithi laia inthawka a keithotu, Pa Pathien zâra tirko ni lem) le,"
2,"and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:","ka kuoma unau um po pohai chun, Galati rama kohranhai kuomah:"
3,"Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,",Pa Pathien le ei Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawkin lungin- sietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se:
4,"who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:","ama chun ei Pathien le ei Pa remtizâwngin tulai khawvêl suoltaka a mi san suok theina dingin, ei suolhai aiin ama ân pe tah a;"
5,to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.,Pathien kuoma chun ropuina chatuonin um raw se. Amen.
6,I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;,Krista lunginsietna zâra a kotu cheu kha chuong ang thuta chanchin ṭha dang tienga in kai san hi a mak ka ti a nih.
7,"which is not another gospel: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.","Chu chu Chanchin Ṭha a ni ve si nawh a; nangni sukbuoiin, Krista Chanchin Ṭha suk danglam nuom tuhai amanih an um el a nih."
8,"But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.","Nisienlakhawm, keiniin amanih, vâna inthawka hung ṭum vântirko khawmin amanih, Chanchin Ṭha kan ihril cheu ti lo kha chu chanchin ṭha dang hrim hrim lo hril sien la cheu ṭawngsephurin um raw se."
9,"As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.","Inhmaa kan hril ang khan tuhin ka hril nâwk ding a nih, “Chanchin Ṭha in ipawm naw kha chu, chanchin ṭha dang tûkhawmin hril sien la cheu, ṭawngsephurin um raw se.”"
10,"For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.","Anleh, tuhin mihriem suklâwm tum am ka ni, Pathien suklâwm? Annawleh, mihriem laia tlâktlum tum ringawt am ka nih? Lo ni lang chu Krista suok ni naw ningah."
11,"For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.","Chuongchun, unauhai, ka Chanchin Ṭha hril kha mihriem tieng thu a ni nawh ti kân hriettir cheu."
12,"For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.","Mihriem kuoma inthawka hmu ka ni bawk nawh a, mi mîn chûktir ka ni bawk nawh. Isu Krista inlârna leia hmu ka ni lem sih a."
13,"For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:","Judahai sakhuo biek dâna chun inhmaa ka um dân chu in hriet ta sih a, khânga Pathien kohranhai nasa- taka suknawmnain ka sukbuoi hlak kha;"
14,"and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.","chun, ka thlatuhai thurosie chunga ṭhahnem ka ngai nasa bîk leiin, Judahai sakhaw biek dân kawnga chun ka chihai laia ka ruolpui tamtakhai ka lekhêl tah a."
15,"But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,","Chun, ka nu phîngsûnga inthawka a mi suktumtu le, a lungin- sietna leia a mi kotu Pathien chun lungnitaka,"
16,"to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:","Jentailhai laia Chanchin Ṭha ka hril theina dingin, a Naupa chu keimaa ân lârtir lai khan, tisa le thisen kân rawnpui nawh a."
17,neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.,"Tirko ka ni hmaa tirko lo ni tahai kuomah Jerusalemah hang fe chuong loin, Arabia ramah ka fe hmang nghâl ta lem a. Chun, Damaskaah ka kîr nâwk tah a."
18,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.","Chun, kum thum ân vawi hnungin Kipha kan dingin Jerusa- lemah ka hang feh a, a kuomah ni sâwmpanga ka châm a."
19,"But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.","Tirko danghai ruok chu, Lalpa unau Jakob chau naw chu, tûkhawm ka hmu nawh a."
20,"Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.","(Ngai hman ta u, in kuoma thu ka ziekhai hi Pathien mithmua khawm kân khêl nawh)."
21,Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.,Chu hnunga chun Suria le Kiliki ramahai ka hung tah a.
22,And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judæa which were in Christ:,"Nisienlakhawm, Judai ram kohran Kristaa umhai hmêlhriet ka la ni naw ta rawp a,"
23,"but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;","“Inhmaa a mi suknawmnatu khan, inhmaa ringna thu a suk- khawhlo hlak kha tuhin a hril ta lem a nih,” ti mi hril chau an hriet a."
24,and they glorified God in me.,"Chun, keia leiin Pathien an chawimawi tah a."
