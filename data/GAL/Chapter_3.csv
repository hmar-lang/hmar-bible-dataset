1,"O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?","Aw, Galati rama mi invêthai, tûin am a dâwi cheu a, in mithmu ngeiah Isu Krista chu hemdein chiengtaka inlangtir a ni vei leh?"
2,"This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?","Hi chau hi in kuoma inthawkin lo hriet ka nuom: Dân thilthawhai leiin am Thlarau chu in hmuh a, in ngaithlâka in ring leiin? Hieng lâwm hin in invêt a ni maw?"
3,"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?",Thlaraua ṭan ta siin tisain in zo ding a ni maw?
4,Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.,Thil chuong zât zât chu a thlâwn elin in tuor a ni maw? A thlâwn hlawl el chu ni lo e!
5,"He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?","Chun, in kuoma Thlarau petu cheu le nangni laia thilmak thawtu chun Dân thilthawhai leiin am a thawh a, in ngaithlâka in ring leiin?"
6,"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.",Abrahamin Pathien a ring a; chu ringna chu a felnaa ruot a ni ang khan.
7,"Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.","Chuleiin, hre ro, ringnaa umhai, chuonghai ngei chu Abraham nauhai an nih."
8,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations be blessed.","Pathien Lekha thu chun, Pathienin ringna leiin Jentailhai thiem ân changtir ding a nih ti hre lâwkin, “Nangmaa chun hnam tin malsâwmpêkin um an tih,” tiin Abraham kuomah Chanchin Ṭha chu a hril lâwk kha."
9,So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.,"Chuongchun, ringnaa umhai chu Abraham ringum le chun malsâwm- pêkin an um hlak a nih."
10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.","Dân thilthawa um taphawthai chu ṭawngse hnuoiah an um sih a, “Dân Lekhabua thu ziek po po anga thaw dinga um zing naw taphawt chu ṭawngsephurin an um hlak,” ti ziek a ni sih a."
11,"Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;","Chun, Pathien mithmuin tû- khawm Dân leiin thiem chang an um nawh ti ân lang zing a nih, “Ringna leia mifel chu hring a tih,” ti a ni sih a,"
12,"and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.","chun, Dân chu ringnaa inthawk a ni nawh a, “Chuong anga thawtu chu chuonga chun hring a tih,” ti a ni lem."
13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:","Krista chu ei aia ṭawngsephur chu lo niin, Dân ṭawngsiea inthawk chun a mîn tlan suok tah a; (“Thinga khaikâng taphawt chu ṭawngsephur an nih,” ti ziek a ni sih a)."
14,that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.,"Chuongchun, Abraham chunga malsâwmna chu Krista Isua chun Jentailhai chungah hung um thei a ta; chuongchun, ringna leiin Thlarau tiem chu hmu thei ei tih."
15,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.","Unauhai, mihriem angin ka hril hi, mihriem thuthlung khawm ni sien la, sukdet ta hnungin an sût nâwk ta ngai nawh a, bel khawm an belsa ngai bawk nawh."
16,"Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.","Chun, Abraham kuomah a nih thu chu tiema a lo um chu, a chithla kuoma khawm. Mi tamtak chungthu hril angin, “Chithlahai kuoma khawm,” a ti nawh a, mi pakhat chungthu hril angin, “I chithla kuoma khawm,” a ti lem a nih, chu chu Krista chu a nih."
17,"Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.","Chun, hienghin ka ti a nih: Thuthlung Pathienin a lo sukdet ta chu, Dân kum za li sâwmthum hnunga hung um ta khan thutiem chu iengkhawm loa siemin a sukbo nawh a."
18,"For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.","Rohluo ding chu Dân lei a ni chun thutiem lei ni ta naw nih a; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin thutiem leiin a nih Abraham kuoma a pêk chu."
19,"What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.","Annawleh, iengtiziea Dân chu um am a ni leh: Chithla thutiemna chu a hung hmakhat chu bawsiet- nahai leiin belsain a um a, vântir- kohai hmanga palai kuta rêl a nih."
20,Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.,"Chun, palai hrim hrim mi pakhat inkâra palai a ni ngai nawh a; Pathien ruok chu pakhat a nih."
21,"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.","Annawleh, Dân chun Pathien thutiemhai chu a kal am a nih? Teu lo e a! Dân mi sukhringthei hrim hrim pêkin a um ta si chun, felna chu Dân leiin a um ngei ding a nih."
22,"But the scripture shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.","Nisienlakhawm, Isu Krista ring leia thiltiem chu ringtuhai kuoma pêk a ni theina dingin, Pathien Lekha thu chun suol hnuoiah iengkim a khârkhip ta vawng a."
23,"But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.","Nisienlakhawm, ringna a hung tlung hma khan, ringna hung inlang ding ta dinga khârkhipa Dân hnuoia vêng ei ni kha."
24,"So that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.","Chuongchun, Dân chu ringna leia thiem ei chang theina dinga Krista kuom tienga a mi keihruoitu a lo nih."
25,"But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.","Nisienlakhawm, tuta ringna a hung tlung hnung hin, keihruoitu hnuoiah ei um ta nawh a."
26,"For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.",Isu Krista ring leiin Pathien nauhai in ni vawng sih a.
27,For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.,Nangni laia Kristaa baptisma chang phawthai kha Krista chun in inthuom ta sih a.
28,"There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one man in Christ Jesus.","Chutaka chun Juda mi an um thei nawh a, Grik mi khawm an um thei bawk nawh; suok an um thei nawh a, suoknaw khawm an um thei bawk nawh; nuhmei le pasal khawm an um thei nawh; Krista Isua chun in rêngin pumkhat in ni sih a."
29,"And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.","Chun, Krista ta in ni chun, Abraham thla, thutiem anga ro- hluotu dinghai in nih."
