verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.","Unauhai, mi suol iengkhawm a thaw laia phâwkin um sien la, nangni thlarau mihai, “Thlemna tuok ve rawi ka tih,” tia invêng ṭha pumin chuong ang mi chu thuhnuoirawl- takin tungding nâwk ro."
2,"Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.","In rikphurhai chu insâwngtuo ro; chuongchun, Krista dân chu in zâwm nîng a tih."
3,"For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.","Mi iengkhawm ni si loin, mi lien deua ân ngai chun, ân hlêm fâwm el a ni sih a."
4,"But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor.","Mi tinin mani thilthaw infie seng lem raw hai se, chu hnunga chun, mi dang chungah ni loin, mani chung chauah suong ding nei an tih."
5,For each man shall bear his own burden.,Mi tinin mani phur an phur seng ding a ni sih a.
6,But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.,"Chun, thu inchûktir dawngtu chun, thilṭha po po inchûktirtu kuomah pe ve raw se."
7,"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.","Hlêmin um naw ro; Pathien chu hmusit zie a ni nawh; miin a ithe ang ang, chu bawk chu a sîk ding a ni sih a."
8,For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.,Mani tisa tienga thetu chun tisaa sietna chu sîk a tih; Thlarau tienga thetu ruok chun Thlaraua chatuona hringna a sîk ding a nih.
9,"And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.","Chuongchun, thil ṭha thaw chu nghawk nâwng ei tiu, ei inhlêmsan naw chun a hun taka chun ei sîk ngei ding a nih."
10,"So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.","Chuongchun, remchâng hun ei nei ang peiin mi po po kuomah thil ṭha chu thâwng ei tiu, ringna sûnghai laia mi chungah thaw bîk tak ei tiu."
11,See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.,Keima kut ngeiin in kuomah lekha inhrawl pherphura ka ziek hi en ta u.
12,"As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.","Tisaa hmêl insukmawi nuomhai poin sertana um dingin an tir lui hlak cheu a nih; ieng dang lei khawm a ni nawh a, Krista kraws leia suk- nawmnatna an tuor nawna ding chau a nih."
13,"For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.",Sertanhai meu khawm chun Dân thu an zâwm chuong si nawh a; in tisaa chun suong ding an nei theina dingin ser intantir cheu an nuom el a nih.
14,"But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.","Kei ruok chun ei Lalpa Isu Krista kraws naw chu ka suong naw ding zie chu, chu zâra chun khawvêl hi ka ta dinga hemdein a um tah, kei khawm khawvêl ta dinga hemdein ka um a nih."
15,"For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.","Siem thar nâwkna naw chu sertan hi iengkhawm a ni nawh a, sertannaw khawm iengkhawm a ni chuong bawk nawh."
16,"And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.","Chun, chu dân anga um taphawthai chunga chun inremna le lunginsietna um raw se, Pathien Israelhai chunga khawm."
17,Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.,"Tuta chen chu tûkhawmin mi sukbuoi ta naw raw hai se, ka tisaa hin Isu inchiknahai ka put sih a."
18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.","Unauhai, Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna in thlarau kuomah um raw se. Amen."
