verse_no,en,hmr
1,"But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;","Nisienlakhawm, hienghin ka ti a nih: Rohluotu ding chu iengkim chunga hotu ni sien la khawm, naupang a la ni sûng chu suok leh danglamna a la nei chuong nawh."
2,but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.,A pa ruot hun chu a hung tlung hmakhat chu vêngtu le enkawltuhai hnuoiah a um lem a nih.
3,"So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:","Chuong angin eini khawm naupang ei ni lai khan, khawvêl A AW B hnuoiah suokin ei um."
4,"but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,","Nisienlakhawm, a hunbi a hung kim khan, Pathienin a Naupa, nuh- mei inei, Dân hnuoia hung piengin, a tir suok tah a,"
5,"that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.",nau nina ei hmu theina dinga Dân hnuoia umhai chu intlan dingin.
6,"And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.","Chun, nau in ni leiin Pathienin a Naupa Thlarau chu, “Abba! (Pa!)” tia khêkin, ei lungrilah a hung tir a."
7,"So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.","Chuongchun, suok i ni ta nawh a, nau i ni lem; chun, nau i ni chun Pathien zâra rohluotu ding i nih."
8,"Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods:","Nisienlakhawm, khânga Pathien in hriet naw lai khan, an piengzie hrim khawma Pathien ni dêrlohai suok in na."
9,"but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?","Tuta Pathien in hung hriet hnung hin chu — ti nêk hmanin, Pathien mi hriet in hung ni hnung hin chu, ti ding a ni lem — khawvêl A AW B derdêp le teplo mei mei, a suoka um nâwk in inhâwkhai tienga chun, iengtiziea nghakîr nâwk am in na?"
10,"Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.","Nihai, thlahai, hunhai, kumhai in inser hlak."
11,"I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.",In ta dingin tha ka sêng thlâwn el rawi am ti hi kân lau pêk cheu.
12,"I beseech you, brethren, become as I am, for I also am become as ye are. Ye did me no wrong:","Unauhai, ka ngên cheu a nih, keia angin um ro, kei khawm nangni angin ka um sih a. Ka pawi iengkhawm in tâwk nawh."
13,but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:,"Chanchin Ṭha in kuoma ka hril hmasak ṭum kha, ka tisa hrâtnawna lei a nih ti in hriet sih a."
14,"and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.","Chun, ka taksaa in ta dinga thlêmna um chu in hmusit naw a, in tirdak naw bawk a; Pathien vântirko angin, Krista Isu ang elin, in mi lâwm lem ta kha."
15,"Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.","Vângnei in intina kha khâwlai am a um tah a? Thaw thei ruol chu ni lem sien la, nangnîn in mithai kheldawkin mi pe tâng in tih ti ka hriet pêk cheu in sawnnaw."
16,"So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?","Chuongchun, thu indiktak ka hril cheu leiin in hmêlma ka lo ni tah a ni maw?"
17,"They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.","Ṭhat tiengah ni dêr si loin, nasatakin an ngaisak hlak cheu a, anni in ngaisak theina dingin keinia inthawka ṭhethlâk cheu tum an ni tak."
18,"But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.","Thu ṭha tienga ruok chu, ieng lai khawmin, ṭhahnemngaitaka zawnga um rawp hi a ṭha a nih, in kuoma ka um lai chau ni loin."
19,"My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you—","Ka nauhai, Krista chu nangnia siem puitlinga a um hmakhat chu nauha invawiin kân vawi nâwk cheu hi."
20,"but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.","Anih, tulai hin in kuoma uma ka rawl sukdanglam kân hâwk thei zie chu, in chungthuah ka lunginzîng sih a."
21,"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?","Dân hnuoia um nuomhai, mi hril ta u, Dân thu chu in ngai hlak naw am a nih?"
22,"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.","Hieng ang hin ziek a ni sih a, “Abrahamin naupasal pahni a nei a, pakhat chu a suoknu leh, pakhat chu a suoknawnu leh."
23,Howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise.,"Nisienlakhawm, suoknu le nau chu tisa dân angin a pieng a, suoknawnu le nau ruok chu thutiem leiin a pieng a nih,” ti hi."
24,"Which things contain an allegory: for these women are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.","Chuong thu chu tekhina a nih: chuong nuhmeihai chu thuthlung pahni an nih, pakhat chu Sinai tlânga mi suok ni dinga nau neitu chu, chu chu Hagar a nih."
25,Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.,"Chun, Hagar hi Arabia rama Sinai tlâng chu a nih Jerusalem tulaia um le hin angkhat an nih; a nauhai leh suokah an um sih a."
26,"But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.","Chungtieng Jerusalem ruok chu suok a ni nawh a, chu ngei chu eini nu a nih."
27,"For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband.","“Nang ching, nau nei ngai lo hlim rawh. Nang nauha invawi ngai lo khêk suok rawh; Pasal nei mi nêk chun khawsâwtnu chun Nauhai a nei tam lem sih a,” ti ziek a ni kha."
28,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.","Chuongchun, unauhai, eini hi Isak ang khan thutiem nauhai ei nih."
29,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so also it is now.","Chun, chuong lai chun, tisa dâna hung pieng khan, Thlarau dâna hung pieng chu a suknawmna a, tu khawm hin chuong ang bawk chu a nih."
30,Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathien Lekha thuin iengtin am a hril a? “Suoknu chu, a naupa leh hnawtdawk rawh, suoknu naupa chun suoknawnu naupa chu ro a hluopui âwm si nawh a,” a tih a."
31,"Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.","Chuongchun, unauhai, suoknu nauhai ei ni nawh a, suoknawnu le nauhai ei ni lem."
