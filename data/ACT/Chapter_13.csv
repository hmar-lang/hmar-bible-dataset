1,"Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.","Chun, Antiokeia kohran lai chun thu hriltuhai le inchûktirhai an um; chuong chu Barnaba hai, Simeon Niger an ti hai, Kurini khuoa Lukia hai, lal Herod unau Manaina hai, Saula hai leh an nih."
2,"And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.","Chun, Lalpa rawng an bâwl a, bu an nghei laiin, Thlarau Inthiengin, “Barnaba le Saula hi anni ka ruot ang san thaw dingin mi suktumpêk ro,” a ta."
3,"Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.","Chuongchun, bu nghei a, an ṭawngṭai zo chun an chungah kut an innghat a, an infetir tah a."
4,"So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.","Chuongchun, Thlarau Inthieng tir suok chun an fe tah a, Selukai khuoah an fe thlah a, chutaka in- thawkin Kupra thlierkârah lâwngin an feh a."
5,"And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant.","Chun, Salamis khuoa an um laiin, Juda inkhâwmna inahai Pathien thu an hril hlak; Johan khawm kha an rawng bâwl dingin an ṭhuoi veh a."
6,"And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus;","Chun, thlierkâr chu Paphos chenin an fang suok a, dawithiem zâwlnei tehlêm, Juda mi pakhat an hmuh a, a hming chu Bar-Isu a nih."
7,"who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.","Ama chu, lal aiawtu, Serjia Paula, mi vartak kuoma um a nih. Chu lal aiawtu chun, Barnaba le Saula chu a ko a, Pathien thu hriet a tum a."
8,"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.","Nisienlakhawm, Elum, (Bar-Isu hming dang umzie hi Dawithiem tina a nih), chu mipa chun, lal aiawtu chu, inringnawtir tumin, anni chu a lo kal a."
9,"But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,","Chuongchun, Saula, (Paula an ti bawk chu), Thlarau Inthiengin a sip a, ama chu a en zing a,"
10,"and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?","“Nang mi hlêm le theidaum tinrênga sippa, nang diebol naupa, nang felna tinrêng kawp nawpa, Lalpa kawng feltakhai hi suksiet ma naw ti ni maw?"
11,"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.","Hre rawh, tuhin Lalpa kut i chungah a tla a ni hi, i mit hung indel a ta, khaw var hmu hri naw ti ni,” a ta. Chuongchun, inthim le sûmin ama a baw nghâl tah a, kuta keitu ding zawngin ân vâk a."
12,"Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.","Chun, Lal aiawtu chun, chuong thil chu a hmuh a, Lalpa inchûktir thu chu mak a ti hleh, a ing tah a."
13,"Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.","Chun, Paula chu a rawihai le chun, Paphos khuoa inthawk chun lawngin an feh a. Pamphulia rama Perga an tlung a; chun, Johan khan anni chu a mâksan a, Jerusalemah a kîr nâwk tah a."
14,"But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chu Pergaa inthawkin an fe pei a, Pisidia rama Antiokei an tlung a; chun, Châwlniin inkhâwmna inah an lût a, an ṭhung a."
15,"And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.","Chun, Dân Lekhabu le Zâwl- neihai lekhabu tiem zoin inkhâwmna hotuhaiin an kuomah mi an tir a, “Unauhai, mihai infuina thu ieng amanih in nei chun hril ro,” an ta."
16,"And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken:","Chun, Paula a ngîr a, kutin a zâp a, a hril a: “Israel mihai le Pathien ṭituhai, ngai ro."
17,"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.","Hieng Israel chihai Pathien hin, ei thlatuhai a thlang a, Aigupta rama an thang zing lai khan a chawimawi a, kut chunghnungin chutaka inthawk chun a ṭhuoi suok tah a."
18,And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.,Kum sâwmli lai thlalêra khan an thilthawhai chu a en thei zing a.
19,"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:","Chun, Kanaan rama hnam sari a suktlâwm zo hnung khan an ram chu hluo dingin a pêk pei a, kum zali sâwmnga sûng po khan."
20,and after these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.,"Chuong hnunga chun, rorêltu- hai a pêk hlak a, zâwlnei Samuel chen khan."
21,"And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.","Chun, chu hnunga chun lal an hnih a; chuongchun, Pathienin Saula, Kis naupa, Benjamin chia mi kha an kuomah a pêk a, kum sâwmli sûnga dingin."
22,"And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will.","Chun, ama chu a sawn hmang hnung khan an lala um dingin David a siem tah a; Pathienin chu thu chu inhriettirin, ‘David, Jessai naupa, ka lungril ang put mi ka hmu suok tah, ama chun ka dit zâwng taphawt thâwng a tih,’ a ta."
23,"Of this man’s seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus;","“Chu thlahai laia chun Pathien- in, thutiem ang peiin, Israelhai Sandamtu Isu a hung intlun a."
24,when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.,A hung hmain Johanin simna baptisma chu Israel mi po po lai a lo hril ta a.
25,"And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not he. But behold, there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.","Chun, Johanin a lampui a hraw suok ding lai chun, ‘Nangnîn tu âm in mi ruot a? Ama chu ka ni nawh ie. Nisienlakhawm, ngai ta u, ka hnungah mi tû amanih a hung ding a nih, kei hi chu a kephaa a kekawk sût tlâk khawm ka ni nawh,’ a ta."
26,"Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.","“Unauhai, Abraham thla nau- hai, nangni laia Pathien ṭi po pohai, eini kuoma hin hieng sandamna thu hi a mi hung inphur suok a ni hi."
27,"For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.","Jerusalema umhaiin, an hotu- hai leh, ama chu an hriet naw lei le, zâwlneihai thu, Châwlni ta- phawta tiem hlak kha, an hriet bawk naw leiin, ama chu thiemnaw in- changtirin, chu thu chu an hlen tah a."
28,"And though they found no cause of death in him, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.","A thina khawp meu a chung- ah iengkhawm an hmu naw khawm- in, Pilat kuomah sukhlum an ngên a."
29,"And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.","Chun, a thu zâwlneihaiin an ziek lâwk po po kha an hlen zo hnungin, thinga inthawk chu an lâk thlâk a, thlânah an inzâl tah a."
30,But God raised him from the dead:,"Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin mi- thi laia inthawkin a keitho nâwk tah a."
31,"and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people.","Chun, Galili rama inthawka Jerusalema ama ruola hang fe vehai kuoma chun ni sâwt tak sûngin ân lâr hlak a; chuong mihai chu tuhin mi kuoma a thu hretuhai an nih."
32,"And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers,","Keini khawmin thlatuhai kuomah thutiem kha a chanchin lâwmum kan hung hril cheu hi,"
33,"that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.","khânga Pathienin Isu a keitho khan, eini an nauhai lei hin chuong chu a hlen a nih, Inpâkna Hla pa- hninaah, ‘Ka naupa i nih ie, vawisûn hin ka nei che a nih,’ ti ziek ang bawk khan."
34,"And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.","Hmawnna hmuna fe nâwk lo dingin Pathienin ama chu mithi laia inthawkin a keitho dingzie thu chu hieng hin a hril a nih, ‘David kuoma lunginsietna ka itiem tlathai kha nanga kuomah pêng ka che,’ tiin."
35,"Because he saith also in another psalm, Thou wilt not give thy Holy One to see corruption.","Chuleiin, Hla dangin, ‘I Mi In- thieng chu hmawn hmang phal naw ti nih a,’ a ti bawk a."
36,"For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:","David chu, Pathien rorêlpêk angin a dam ruolpuihai rawng a bâwl zo khan, a in innghil a, a thlatuhai kuomah an inzâl a, a hmawn hmang tah a nih."
37,but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.,Pathienin a ikeitho ruok kha chu a hmawn hmang naw kha.
38,"Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins:","“Chuongchun, unauhai, hre ro; ama lei chun, suol ngaidamna thu in kuomah hril a ni hi;"
39,"and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.","tûkhawm ama ring taphawt chu, iengkimah ama thiem inchang- tirin a um, chuonga chun, Mosie Dânin thiem inchangtirin in um thei nawh."
40,"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets:","Chuleiin, fîmkhur ro, chuong naw chun, zâwlneihai lekhabua an hril kha in chungah hung tlung a tih,"
41,"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; For I work a work in your days, A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you.","‘Hmusittuhai en ta u, Makti unla, bohmang ro; In dam sûng hin thil kawng khat ka thaw hi, Chu thil chu miin hril hai sienla cheu khawm, Awi tawp naw ti niu,’ a ti kha,” a ta."
42,"And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.","Chun, an suok chun, Châwlni nâwka chuong thu chu hril nâwk dingin an ngên a."
43,"Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.","Chun, inkhâwmhai chu an ṭin phingleh, Judahai le an saphun Pathien ngaisak laia mi tamtakin Paula le Barnaba chu an zui pei a; anni chun an lo biek a, Pathien lunginsietnaa chun um zing dingin an infui a."
44,And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.,"Chun, Châwlni nâwka chun a khuo deu thawin Pathien thu ngai dingin an hung inkhâwm a."
45,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.","Nisienlakhawm, Judahaiin mi- puihai chu an hmu phingleh an îtthîk bêk el a; Paula thu hril chu an sêlkal a, an hrilpâwi hleh a."
46,"And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.","Chun, Paula le Barnaba chun huoitakin an hril dawk a, “Pathien thu hi nangni kuoma hril hmasak hrim ding a nih; nisienlakhawm, in lo dang kîr a, chatuona hring tlâk loa in inruot ta hnung chu, hre ro, Jentailhai kuom tieng ngha ta vêng kan tih."
47,"For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.","Chuong ang chun Lalpain thu a mi pêk a nih. ‘Jentailhai sukvartuah ka ruot che, Kâwlkawdawng chena sandamna in tlun theina dingin,’ ti ziek ang khan,” an ta."
48,"And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.","Chun, Jentailhai chun chuong thu chu an hrietin an lâwm a, Pathien chu an chawimawi a, chun, chatuona hring dinga ruot po chun an ring tah a."
49,And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.,"Chun, Lalpa thu chu, chu lai ram khawvêla chun ân dar tah a."
50,"But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.","Nisienlakhawm, Judahai chun nuhmei inzaum Pathien ngaisakhai le khuoa upahai chu an infui a, Paula le Barnaba chu an insuknawmnatir a, an rama inthawkin an hnawt suok tah a."
51,"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.","Chun, anni chun an chungah an kephaa pilvut an thinthlâk a, Ikoniom an tlung tah a."
52,And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.,"Chun, închûktirhai chu lâwmna le Thlarau Inthiengin an sip tâwl a."
