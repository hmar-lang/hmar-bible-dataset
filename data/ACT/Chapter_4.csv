1,"And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,","Chun, Peter le Johanin mihai kuomah thu an hril leiin, thiempuhai, biekin hotuhai, Saddu- kaihai chu an kuom an hung tlung phut a."
2,"being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.",Mi an inchûktir le Isu leiin mithi laia inthawka thonâwk thu an hril leiin an lungninaw bêk bêk a.
3,"And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.","Chun, an man a, zântieng a ni leiin a zîng chena dingin intângna inah an khum tah a."
4,But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.,"Nisienlakhawm, thu ngaihai a ṭhen tamtakin an awi a; an tam tieng chu patling ruok khawm sâng nga lai an tling a."
5,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;","Chun, a zînga chun an hotuhai, upahai, Dân inchûktirtuhai, Jeru- salemah an um khâwm a,"
6,"and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.","Thiempu Laltak Anna hai, Kaia- pha hai, Johan hai, Alexandra hai, Thiempu Laltak chihai po po le chun."
7,"And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?","Chun, Peter le Johan chu a laiah an inngîrtir a, “Ieng thuneinain am, tu hmingin am hieng hi in thaw a?” an ta, an indawn a."
8,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,","Chuongchun, Peter chu Thlarau Inthiengin a sip a, an kuomah, “Mi po po hotuhai, upahai,"
9,"if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;","mi hrâtnaw sukṭhat thuah, ‘Hi mipa hi ieng leiin am a hung dam tah a?’ tiin vawisûn hin in mi fie a ni chun,"
10,"be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even in him doth this man stand here before you whole.","nangni po poin hre ro, Israel mi po khawmin hre raw se, Nazareth Isu Krista krawsa in hemde Pathienin mithi laia inthawka a ikeitho nâwk kha, ama hming ngeiin hi mipa hi hitaka hin in hmaah damin a ngîr tah a ni hi."
11,"He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.","Nangni in bâwltuhai, in lung dehâwn, a kia lung ṭhangkaitak lo ni ta kha ama hi a nih."
12,"And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.","Mi dang tu kuoma khawm san- damna a um nawh; vânkhuphnuoia mihriem isak lai, a mi sandam ding hming dang hrim a um nawh,” a ta."
13,"Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.","Chun, Peter le Johan huoizie chu an hmu chun lekha thiemnaw le mi narân el an nih ti an hrietin, mak an ti hleh a; Isu kuomah an um tah ti an hriet tah a."
14,"And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.","Chun, mi an sukdam chu an kâwla ngîr an hmuh a, iengkhawm an sawisêl thei si nawh."
15,"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,","Chuongchun, an rorêlnaa in- thawk a an infetir hnungin an inrawn a,"
16,"saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.",“Hieng mihai hi iengtin am thâwng ei ta? Thilmak inthangtak an thaw ti Jerusalema um po poin an hriet ta hi; eini khawmin ei sêl thei si nawh a.
17,"But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.","Nisienlakhawm, mi kuoma ân phuong nâwk zuol nawna dingin, tuta inthawk tû kuoma khawm hi hminga thu an hril nawna dingin vau ei tiu,” an ta."
18,"And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.","Chuongchun, anni chu an ko a, Isu hminga thu hril dêr lo ding an ti tlat a."
19,"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye:","Nisienlakhawm, Peter le Johan- in an kuomah, “Pathien mithmuin, Pathien thu zâwm nêkin nangni thu zâwm ân dik lem am chu, ngaituo ro."
20,for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.,"Keini chu thil kan hmu le kan hriethai kha hril loin kan um thei nawh,” an ta."
21,"And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.","Chun, anni chun an vau nâwk zuol a, an insuo tah a. Mipui leiin hremna remchâng an hmu nawh; an thilthaw lei khan mi po poin Pathien an chawimawi sih a."
22,"For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.",Thilmaka an isukdam chu kum sâwmli nêk hmana ta m lem a ni sih a.
23,"And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.","Chun, Peter le Johan chu an suok chun anni pâwlhai lai an va feh a; thiempu lalhai le upahaiin an kuoma an hril po chu an hril vawng a."
24,"And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:","Chuongchun, a ngaihai chun a ruolin rawl inringtakin Pathien kuomah, “Lalpa, nang hnuoi hai, vân hai, tuisuoriet hai, a sûnga um po pohai siemtu i nih;"
25,"who by the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say, Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples imagine vain things?","nangin Thlarau Inthiengin, kan thlatu i siehlaw David bauin, hieng thu hi i hril a nih:- ‘Jentailhai iengdinga an lunginsen am? Hnam tinin iengdinga thil teplo an ngaituo am a na?"
26,"The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:","Khawvêl lalhaiin an ep huoi huoi a, Hotuhai khawm an pung khâwm a, Lalpa le a Krista chunga chun,’ tiin."
27,"for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,","“Hi khuoa hin i siehlaw in- thieng, i hriek nâl, Isu chunga khan Herod le Pontia Pilat le, Jentailhai le Israel mihai an pungkhâwm tak zet a nih;"
28,to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel foreordained to come to pass.,i kut le i lungrilin tlung dinga i ruot lâwk taphawt kha thaw dingin.
29,"And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,","Chuongchun, tuhin Lalpa, an mi vauzie hi ngai ta; i suokhai hi huoitakin i thu inhriltir la,"
30,while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.,"mihai sukdam dingin i kut phar bawk rawh; i siehlaw inthieng Isu hmingin inchikna le thilmakhai inthawtir bawk rawh,” an ta."
31,"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.","Chun, an ṭawngṭai zo chun an umna in chu a hung inhnîng a, an rêngin Thlarau Inthiengin an hung sip a, huoitakin Pathien thu an hril tah a."
32,And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one of them said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.,"Chun, a ringtu mipuihai chu lungril hmunkhat le ngaituo hmun- khatin an um a; anni laia pakhat khawmin an sum nei, “Ka ta bîk a nih,” an ti nawh; thil po po an inṭâwm lem hlak."
33,And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.,"Chun, tirkohai chun awium- takin Lal Isu thonâwk thu an inhriettir hlak a, an rênga chungah lunginsietna nasatak a um."
34,"For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,","Chun, anni lai khawm tlasam tukhawm an um nawh, hnuoihai, inhai nei taphawtin an zawr a, an thil zawrhai chu a man an hung chawi a,"
35,"and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.",tirkohai ke bulah an sie hlak a; an mamaw dai tâwk sengin an sem seng hlak.
36,"And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,","Chun, Josef, tirkohaiin Barna- ba an ti chu, (chu hming umzie chu “Thlamuongna nau,” tina a nih), Levi chi, Kupra thlierkâra mi a na,"
37,"having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.","a lo nei chu zawrin a man a hung chawi a, tirkohai ke bulah a sie tah a."
