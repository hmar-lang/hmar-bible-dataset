1,"And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.","Chun, Ikonioma chun Judahai inkhâwmna inah an lût rêl a, thu an hril hlak a, chuongchun, Grik le Juda tamtak khawmin an ring ta rau a."
2,"But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren.","Nisienlakhawm, ring nuom naw Judahaiin Jentailhai lungril an infui a, unauhai chu an intheidatir a."
3,"Long time therefore they tarried there speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.","Chuleiin, Lalpa thu huoitaka hrilin chutaka chun sâwt rei an um a, ama chun, inchikna le thilmakhai an kuta inthawtirin, a lunginsiet thu ân hriettir hlak a."
4,"But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.","Chun, khuoa mipuihai chu an inkhing tah a; aṭhenin Judahai chu an ṭan a; aṭhenin tirkohai chu."
5,"And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them,","Chun, Jentailhai, Judahai, an hotuhai le chun, tirkohai chu inzakumtaka siem le lunga dêng tuma an thaw ding laiin anni chun an lo hriet a,"
6,"they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about:","Lukaoni ram bawka chun, Lustra le Derbe khuoa le a vêl ramhaia chun an tlân hmang a;"
7,and there they preached the gospel.,"chuonga chun, Chanchin Ṭha an hril pei a."
8,"And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked.","Chun, Lustraa chun ke zeng tû amanih a ṭhung hlak a, a pieng tîra inthawk keinbai hrim a na, kein a lâwn ngai nawh a."
9,"The same heard Paul speaking: who, fastening his eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,","Ama chun, Paula thu hril a ngai a, chun, Paula chun, ama chu a en zing a, damna dingin ringna a nei ti a hriet a,"
10,"said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.","rawl inringtakin, “I kein ngîr tlûn rawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chu ân châwm tho a, kein a lâwn tah a."
11,"And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.","Chun, mipuihaiin Paula thil- thaw chu an hmu phingleh, Lukaoni ṭawngin inringtakin, “Pathienhai chu mihriem angin ei kuomah an hung ṭum tah a ni hi!” an ta."
12,"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.","Chun, Barnaba chu, “Jupitar” an tih a, Paula chu, thu hriltu lem a ni leiin, “Merkuri” an tih a."
13,"And the priest of Jupiter whose temple was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes.","Chun, Jupitar biekin khaw- hnâwma um chu, a thiempu chun sebâwng chalhai le, pâr ṭhihrui limhai, kawtkhâr kâwlah a hung lâk a, mipuihai le chun biekna dingin that an tum a."
14,"But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out","Nisienlakhawm, tirko Barnaba le Paula chun, chu chu an hriet phing- leh, an puon an keithlêr a, mipui lai chun an inchâwm lût a, an khêk a."
15,"and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:","“Puhai, iengdinga hieng thilhai hi in thaw am a na? Keini khawm in nungchang ang put mihriem kan ni hi; hieng thil teplohai hi in nghatsan a, vân hai, hnuoi hai, tuisuoriet hai, an sûnga um po pohai siemtu Pathien hring kuoma chun in hung kawpna dingin Chanchin Ṭha kan hung intlun cheu a ni hi."
16,who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways.,"Chu Pathien chun, tienlaiin hnam tin mâni lampui seng hraw a phal hlak a."
17,"And yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.","Nisienlakhawm, ama inhriettir- na um loin ân siem ngai nawh. Chuongchun, thil a thaw ṭha hlak a, vâna inthawka ruohai le kum ṭhat kumhai a pêk cheu a, in lungril fâk ding le lâwmnain a suktlaipêk hlak cheu kha,” an ta."
18,And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them.,"Chun, chuong thu chun, mipuihaiin anni biekna dinga ran an that ding chu an khap zo hrâm a."
19,"But there came Jews thither from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.","Nisienlakhawm, Antiokei le Ikonioma mi Juda tuhai amanih chutaka chun an hung a, mipuihai chu an zâwr thlûk tah a; chuongchun, Paula chu lungin an dêng a, thia an ring leiin khuoa inthawk chu an hnûk dawk tah a."
20,"But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.","Nisienlakhawm, inchûktirhai chu a vêla an ngîr laiin, a hung tho a, khuoa chun a lût nâwk tah a. Chun, a zînga chun Barnaba leh Derbeah an fe tah a."
21,"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,","Chu khuohai kuoma chun, Chanchin Ṭha an hril a, inchûktir tamtak an siem hnungin Lustraa hai, Ikonioma hai, Antiokeia hai, an kîr nâwk a."
22,"confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.","“Rinum tamtak tuorin Pathien ramah ei lût ding a ni hrim a nih,” tiin inchûktirhai lungril an sukdet a, ringnaa chun um zing dingin an infui a."
23,"And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.","Chun, kohran tinah upahai an ruot pêk pei a, bu nghei puma an ṭawngṭai zoin, an ring Lalpa kuoma chun an inkawltir pei a."
24,"And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.","Chun, Pisidia ram chu an fang suok a, Pamphulia ram chu an tlung a."
25,"And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;","Chun, Pergaa thu an hril zoin Attaliaah an zu feh a;"
26,"and thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.","chutaka inthawk chun lawngin an suok a, Antiokei chu an hung tlung nâwk tah a, chu chu a thil thaw zo ta chu thaw dinga unauhaiin Pathien lunginsietna inkawltira an suokna kha a nih."
27,"And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles.","Chun, an tlung hnungin ko- hranhai chu an ko khâwm a, Pathienin anni hmanga, thil a thawhai po po le, Jentailhai ta dinga ringna kawtkhâr a hawngpêkziehai chu an hril a."
28,And they tarried no little time with the disciples.,Inchûktirhai lai chun sâwt rei an um tah a.
