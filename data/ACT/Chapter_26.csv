1,"And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:","Chun, Agrippa chun Paula kuoma chun, “I thiemna thu hril thei i tih,” a ta. Chun, Paula chun a kut a phar a, a thiemna thu a hril a,"
2,"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:","“Lal Agrippa, Judahaiin an mi hêkna po poa ka thiemna thu vawisûn hin i hmaa ka hril ding lei hin lâwmin kân hriet;"
3,especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.,"hi hi ka lâwmna tak chu a nih; Judahai laia dân le thubuoi po po kawnga i var ngawt lei hin; chuleiin, muongtaka mi ngai pêk dingin ka ngên che."
4,"My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;","A tîra, ka naupang laia inthawk ka chihai lai le Jerusalema ka um dân kha Judahai po poin an hriet a."
5,"having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.","A tîra inthawka ka chanchin an hriet a, khânga ei sakhuo pâwl kher- mei tak dân pângngaia Pharisaia ka um kha; an nuom phawt chun an mi hrilpui thei a nih."
6,And now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;,"Chun, Pathienin ei thlatuhai kuoma thu a tiem kha beisei kawng thuah tuhin hitaka hin rorêlpêk dingin ka ngîr hi;"
7,"unto which promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!","chu thutiem chu, ei hnam sâwm le pahniin, a sûn a zâna Pathien rawng ṭhahnemngaitaka bâwlin hmu an beisei hlak. Aw, lalpa, chu beiseina lei chun Judahaiin an mi hêk a ni hi."
8,"Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?",“Pathienin mithihai a keitho ti hi iengdinga awium nawa in ruot am a na?
9,I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.,Kei khawmin Nazareth Isu hming kal zâwngin thil tamtak thaw lang ṭhain ka ring hlak a.
10,"And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.","Chuongang chu Jerusalemah ka thaw bawk hlak; chun, thiempu lalhai kuomah thu ka hmuh a, mi inthienghai laia mi tamtak intângna inah ka khum bawk hlak a; chun, an sukhlum laiin sukhlum remti tieng ka ṭhang bawk hlak a."
11,"And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.","Chun, inkhâwmna in tinah ka hrem rawp hlak a, Pathien inhril- siettir ka tum hrâm hlak a; an chungah ka rilo bêk bêk a, ram dang khuo chena khawm ka suknawmna hlak a."
12,"Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,","“Chuong ang thaw dingin, thiempu lalhai thu hmuin le, an tirna lekha chawiin, Damaskaah ka feh a;"
13,"at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.","chun, i aw, lalpa, ka fe laiin, sûnbu fâk pha a nih, vâna inthawkin var ieng amanih, nisa nêka var lem kei le ka fepuihai vêla chun varin ka hmuh a."
14,"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.","Chun, kan rêngin hnuoiah kan tluh a, Hebrai ṭawngin, ‘Saula, Saula, iengdinga nangin i mi suknawmna am a na? Sunna hmawl khêng chu i ta dingin a na ie,’ tiin râwl ka hriet a."
15,"And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.","Chun, keiin, ‘Tu am i na Lalpa?’ ka ta. Lalpa chun, ‘Isu i suknawmnat hi ka nih."
16,"But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;","Nisienlakhawm, tho la, ngir rawh; hieng i thil hmuhai le, i kuoma ka inlarna ding thilhai leh chu rawngbâwla le hretua siem ding chein, i kuomah ka hung inlâr a ni hi."
17,"delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee,",Mi po po le Jentailhai kuta inthawkin sanhim ka ti che.
18,"to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.","An mit sukvar dingin an kuomah ka tir che hi, chuongchun, inthim chu var tieng nghatsan an ta, Setan thuneina chu Pathien tieng nghatsan an tih, suol ngaidamna an hmuna dingin le an mi ringna leia inthieng tahai kuomah ro chan an nei ve theina dingin,’ a ta."
19,"Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:","“Chuleiin, lal Agrippa, vâna mi inlâr chu ka sêl nawh a,"
20,"but declared both to them of Damascus first, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judæa, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.","a tîrin Damaskaa mihai kuomah, chu hnunga chun Jerusa- lema mihai kuoma dâm, Juda ram tina mihai kuoma dâm, Jentailhai kuoma dâm khawm sim hming inbûk tlâka thil thawa, sima, Pathien tieng an nghatna dingin ka hril lem hlak a nih."
21,"For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me.","Chuong lei chun, Judahaiin Pathien biekinah an mi man a, mi sukhlum an tum a."
22,"Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come;","Nisienlakhawm, Pathiena in- thawka ṭhangpuina ka hmu leiin vawisûn chenin mi chînhai le mi lienhai kuomah thu inhriettirin ka la um zing a, zâwlneihai le Mosiein hung tlung ding an ti thu chau naw chu thu dang hril loin;"
23,"how that the Christ must suffer, and how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.","khânga Krista chun rinum tuor a ta; chun, mithi laia inthawka a thonâwk leiin mi po po kuoma le Jentailhai kuoma khawm var inhmutirtu hmasatak nîng a tih, an ti thu kha,” a ta."
24,"And as he thus made his defence, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad.","Chun, chuong anga a thiemna thu a hril laiin, Festa chun rawl inringtakin, “Paula, în vêt a nih, în chûk tamin a sukvêt che a nih,” a ta."
25,"But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula chun, “Festa ṭhatak, kân vêt nawh ie; thu indiktak le thu vartak ka hril lem a ni hi."
26,"For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.","Hieng thu hi lal hin a hriet annâwm, a kuoma khawm ṭi loin ka hril hi; hieng thil hi a kuomah iengkhawm ip a ni nawh ti indiktakin ka hriet deh, hieng hi in kila thaw a ni si nawh a."
27,"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.","Lal Agrippa, zâwlneihai thu i awi am? I awi ti ka hriet,” a ta."
28,"And Agrippa said unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.","Chun, Agrippa chun Paula kuomah, “Sâwtnawtê chau mi thlêm a, Kristiena mi siem i tum a ni hi,” a ta."
29,"And Paul said, I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.","Paula chun, “Sâwt sienla, sâwt naw sienla, nang chau ka ti nawh a, vawisûna ka thu hretuhai po po khawm hi, keia ang bawka um dingin Pathien kuomah ka hni a nih, kawlhai ruok hi chu bun ve loin,” a ta."
30,"And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:","Chun, lal leh, Bawrsâp leh, Berniki le an kâwla ṭhunghai le chun an tho tâwl a;"
31,"and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.","chun, a tumin an feh a, an inbiek a, “Hi mipa hin thina le kawl bunna khawp rau iengkhawm thil a lo thaw luo naw hi,” an ta."
32,"And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cæsar.","Chun, Agrippain Festa kuom- ah, “Hi mipa hin Kaisar kuoma intlun lo tiem ta naw chu ni sienla, a suok el ding bah,” a ta."
