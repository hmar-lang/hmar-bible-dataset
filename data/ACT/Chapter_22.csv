5,"As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.","Thiempu Laltak le upahai po po khawmin chuong thu chu an mi hrietpui thei, an kuoma inthawka unauhai pêk dingin lekha ka hmu kha; chun, Damaskaa um taphawt an hrem dingin, khuop puma Jeru- salema ṭhuoi dingin ka fe kha."

8,"And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.","Chun, keiin, ‘Tu am i na, Lalpa?’ tiin ka dawn a. Ama chun ka kuomah, ‘Nazareth Isu i suknawmnat hi ka nih,’ a ta."

13,"came unto me, and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him.","ka kuomah a hung a, ka kâwlah a ngîr a, ka kuomah, ‘Unau Saula, mitvar nei rawh,’ a mi ta. Chu lai tak chun ka mit chu a hung var a, ama ka hang hmu tah a."

20,"and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him.","chun, i thu hretu Stephan thisen an insuo lai khan kei khawm an kâwlah ka ngîr a, ka lo remtih a, a sukhlumtuhai puonhai dâm ka lo vêng tâwl bawk a nih,’ ka ta."
21,"And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles.","“Chun, ama chun, ‘Fe rawh; hitaka inthawka hlatakah, Jentail- hai kuomah tir lem ka ti che,’ a mi tih a,” a ta."
22,"And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.","Chun, chu thu chen chun an ngai a, rawl inringtakin, “Mi hieng ang hrep hi, khawvêla inthawkin sukbohmang ro, hring tlâk khawm a ni nawh,” an ti tah a."

24,"the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.","chuongchun, sipai hotu laltak chun Paula chu kulbîng sûnga ṭhuoi lût thu a pêk a, a chunga chuong ang lâwma an khêkna san chu hrietna dingin vuok puma suosal dingin a tih a."
25,"And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?","Chun, savun hruia an khuop zoin, Paulain a kâwla ngîr sipai za hotu kuoma chun, “Rom mi hrim hrim in vuok thei am a nih? thiemnaw inchangtir hnung khawm ni si loin,” a ta."
26,"And when the centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, What art thou about to do? for this man is a Roman.","Sipai za hotu chun chu chu a hriet phingleh, sipai hotu laltak kuomah chun a feh a, “I thil thaw ding hi fimkhur raw khai! Hi mipa hi Rom mi a lo nih ie,” a ta, a hril a."
27,"And the chief captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea.","Chun, sipai hotu laltak chu a hung a, a kuomah, “Rom mi i ni maw? Mi hril rawh,” a ta. Ama chun, “Nih e,” a ta."
28,"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am a Roman born.","Sipai hotu laltak chun, “Chu khuoa mi ni dingin kei chu tangka tamtak ka sêng annaw,” a ta, a dawn a. Paula chun, “Kei chu Rom mia pieng hrim ka nih,” a ta."
29,"They then that were about to examine him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.","Chuongchun, sawisak puma suosal tumtuhai chun ama chu an mâksan nghâl tah a; sipai hotu laltak khawmin Rom mi a nih ti a hriet chun a ṭih a, ama a khuop lei khan a ṭi bawk a."
30,"But on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.","Chun, a zînga chun Judahaiin ieng leiin am Paula an hêka ti hriet fel tumin sipai hotu laltak chun ama chu a sût a, thiempu lalhai le rorêltuhai po po inkhâwm dingin thu a pêk a, Paula a ṭhuoi thlâk a, an hmaah ân ngirtir ta a."
