1,"Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Cæsarea.","Chuongchun, Festa chun ram chu a awp tah a; chun, ni thum hnungin Kaisaria inthawk chun Jerusalemah a hang feh a."
2,"And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him,","Chun, thiempu lalhai le Juda hotuhai chun Paula chanchin chu a se tiengin an lo inhriettir a."
3,"asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way.",Jerusalema hung inṭhuoitir ding- in lunginsietna an lo hni rak bawk a; lampuia lo inchâna that an tum a.
4,"Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was kept in charge at Cæsarea, and that he himself was about to depart thither shortly.","Nisienlakhawm, Festa chun, “Paula Kaisariah an vêng zing a nih, kei khawm sâwtnawtêah ka fe ding a nih."
5,"Let them therefore, saith he, that are of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him.","Chuleiin, ama chun suolna a nei chun, nangni laia thuneituhaiin mi zui thla hai sienla, hêk raw hai se,” a ta."
6,"And when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Cæsarea; and on the morrow he sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.","Chun, anni lai chun ni riet amanih, ni sâwm amani chau chu a châm nâwk a, Kaisariah a fe thlah a; chun, a zînga chun rorêlna ṭhungphaah a ṭhung a, Paula chu hung ṭhuoi dingin thu a pêk a."
7,"And when he was come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove;","Chun, ama chu a hung tlung chun, Jerusalema inthawka Juda hung thlahai chu a vêla chun an ngir a, a chungah thupawi tamtak, rik tak tak an hril an hril a, a bul ruok chu an sui suok thei si nawh a."
8,"while Paul said in his defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cæsar, have I sinned at all.","Chun, Paula chun a thiemna thu a hril a, “Judahai Dân chunga dâm, Pathien biekin thua dâm, Kaisar chunga dâm khawm, thil hrim hrim ka suksuol nawh,” a ta."
9,"But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?","Nisienlakhawm, Festa chun Judahai laia hmingṭhat a nuom a, Paula kuoma chun, “Jerusalema hang fea, khitaka ka hmaa i thu rêl i nuom am?” a ta."
10,"But Paul said, I am standing before Cæsar’s judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.","Paula ruok chun, “Kaisar rorêl- na ṭhungpha hmaah, ro rêlpêka ka umna ding hrima chun ngîr ka tih; Judahai chungah thil iengkhawm ka suksuol nawh, nang khawmin chu chu i hriet zing sih a."
11,"If then I am a wrong-doer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those things is true whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. I appeal unto Cæsar.","Mi suol ka nia, thina khawp rau thil thaw ka ni chun, thi khawm ka sêl nawh; nisienlakhawm, hienghai mi hêkna thil hi a bul iengkhawm a um naw chun, tukhawmin an kuomah mi pe thei naw ni hai, Kaisar kuomah intlun ka tih,” a ta."
12,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Cæsar: unto Cæsar shalt thou go.","Chun, Festa chun a rorêlpuitu- hai a biek rawn zoin, “Kaisar kuoma intlun i tum vei a, Kaisar kuomah fe mawl i tih,” tiin a dawn a."
13,"Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Cæsarea, and saluted Festus.","Chun, ni iengzât amani chena chun lal Agrippa le Berniki chu Kaisari an hung tlung a, Festa chibai an bûk a."
14,"And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;","Chun, ni tamtak chutaka chun an châm leiin Festa chun Paula thu- pawi chu lal kuoma chun a hril a, “Felik khan intâng tû amanih a mâksan a."
15,"about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for sentence against him.","Jerusalema ka um lai khan thiempu lalhai le Juda upahaiin a chungchâng thu an mi hril a, thiem- naw inchangtir dingin an ngên a."
16,"To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defence concerning the matter laid against him.","Keiin an kuomah, ‘An ihêk le a hêktuhai an inhmaituok a, an hêkna kawngah a thiemna thu hril vena remchâng a hmu hmakhat chu, mi hrim hrim hrem dinga inthla hi Rom mi dân a ni nawh ie,’ tiin ka dawn a."
17,"When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.","Chun, hitaka an hung tlungin, sâwt riel loin, a zînga chun rorêlna ṭhungphaah ka ṭhung a, ama chu hung ṭhuoi dingin thu ka pêk a."
18,"Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;","Chun, a hêktuhai an ngîr laiin ka ring ang hrimin a chungah suolna thupawi an hril nawh a;"
19,"but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.","an sakhuo dânhai le, Isu mi pakhat thi tahnung, Paula chun, ‘A hring nâwk a nih,’ tiin a hril a; chuong ang a hril lei chun a chungah thubuoihai an lo nei a lo ni lem a."
20,"And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.","Kei chun, chuong thuhai chu ngaituo ngaina hrim ka hriet nawh a, Jerusalemah fe a, khitaka chuong thu chu rêlpêk a nuom le nuom naw kân dawn a."
21,"But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Cæsar.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula chun, Laltak rêl dinga khêk a ngên ta lem a; chuleiin, Kaisar kuoma kân fetir thei hmakhat chu vêng dingin thu ka pêk a,” a ta."
22,"And Agrippa said unto Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.","Chun, Agrippa chun Festa kuoma chun, “Kei khawm chu thu hril chu ngai ka lo nuom rawp hlak hrim a nih,” a ta. Ama chun, “Zingah a thu hril ngai naw ti nîm,” a ta."
23,"So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and the principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.","Chuongchun, a zînga chun, Agrippa le Berniki chu ropuitakin an hung a, thu hrilna inah an hung lût a, sipai hotu lalhai leh, khuoa miṭha deu deuhai leh; chun, Festa thuin Paula an hung inṭhuoilûttir a."
24,"And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.","Chun, Festa chun, “Lal Agrippa le hitaka eini laia um po pohai, hi mipa hi in hmu hi a nih, a chungchâng thuah Judahai po poin, an rêngin hring ta lo dingin, khêk a, Jerusalema le hitaka an mi biekna kha a nih."
25,But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.,"Nisienlakhawm, thina khawp rauin iengkhawm a thaw nawh ti ka hriet a; amiruokchu, ama hin Laltak kuoma intlun a tum leiin tir ka tum a nih,"
26,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.","nisienlakhawm, a thu mumal iengkhawm ka lal kuoma ziek ding ka hriet si nawh a. Chuleiin, in kuomah ka hung ṭhuoi suok hi, lal Agrippa, nanga hmaa hung ṭhuoi bîk deu khawm ka nih, suosal zoa ieng amani bêk ziek ding ka hmu theina dingin."
27,"For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.","Mi intâng Laltak kuoma tir a, a chunga an hêkna thu inhriettir sa naw chu, invêtthlâk niin ka hriet sih a,” a ta."
