1,"And when it came to pass that we were parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:","Chun, anni le chun kan inṭheh a, lawngin kan suok a, chu hnunga chun tlûntakin Kos thlierkâr kan tlung a; chun, a zîngah Rodi thlierkâr kan tlung nâwk a, chutaka inthawkin kan fe pei a, Patara kan tlung a;"
2,"and having found a ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.","chun, Phoiniki ram kai ding lawng pakhat kan hmuh a, kan chuong a, kan fe pei tah a."
3,"And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her burden.","Chun, Kupra thlierkâr kan hmuh a, vawitieng panin kan khêl a, Suria ram tieng kan fe pei a, Turaa chun khawmuolah kan suok phawt a; chu- taka chun lawnga thuomhnaw thak suok ding a nih a."
4,"And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.","Chun, inchûktirhai kan zawng suok a, chutaka chun ni sari kan châm a. Anni chun, Thlarau hrilin, Paula kuomah, Jerusalem sir lo ding an ta."
5,"And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell;","Nisienlakhawm, chuong ni zoa chun kan suok a, kan fe tah a, unauhai chun an rêngin, an nuhmei an nauhai leh khaw kâwl chenin an mi vân thlah a; chun, tuisuoriet panga chun kan dingṭhaṭhuon a, kan ṭawngṭai a."
6,"and we went on board the ship, but they returned home again.","Chun, “Damtakin”, kan in tih a, lawnga chun kan chuong a; anni ruok chu an inah an kîr nâwk tah a."
7,"And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.","Chun, Turaa inthawka lawnga kan fe zo chun Ptolemai kan tlung a, unauhai chibai kan bûk a, an kuomah ni khat kan châm a."
8,"And on the morrow we departed, and came unto Cæsarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.","Chun, a zînga chun kan suok a, Kaisari kan tlung a, Chanchin Ṭha hriltu Philip inah kan lût a, ama chu pasari hai lai khan pakhat a na, a kuomah kan châm a."
9,"Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.","Ama chun naunuhmei pali a nei a, nunghâk inthieng an nih, Pathien thu an hril hlak a."
10,"And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judæa a certain prophet, named Agabus.","Chun, chutaka chun ni tamtak kan châm a, chu lai chun Judai rama inthawkin a hming Agaba, Zâwlnei pakhat a hung thlah a."
11,"And coming to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.","Kan kuomah a hung a, Paula kâwnghrên a lâk a, a kehai, a kuthai ama le ama ân khuop a, chun, “Jerusalema Judahai chun hi kâwnghrên neitu hi hieng ang hin khuop an tih, Jentailhai kutah pe bawk an tih, Thlarau Inthiengin a tih,” a ta."
12,"And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.","Chuong thu chu kan hriet phingleh, keini le chu khuoa mihai chun Paula chu Jerusalema hang fe lo dingin kan ngên ta rak a."
13,"Then Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.","Paula chun a dawn a, “Ieng am in ti a ni leh, in ṭap in ṭap a, ka thla in suksie ie! Lalpa Isu hming lei chun Jerusalema khuop chau ni loin, thi khawm ka huom in sawnnaw,” a ta."
14,"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.","Chun, thlêm ruol a ni naw hnung chun, “Lalpa thu thu ni raw se,” kan ta, kan ma tah a."
15,And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.,"Chun, chu hnunga chun kan thuomhnaw kan siem a, Jerusalemah kan hang feh a."
16,"And there went with us also certain of the disciples from Cæsarea, bringing with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.","Kaisaria mi inchûktir tuhai amanih kan kuomah an fe veh a, anni chun a hming Mnason, inchûktir hmasa pâwl, Kupra thlierkâra mi pakhat, kan tlung-in dingpa chu an ṭhuoi veh a."
17,"And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.","Chun, Jerusalem kan tlung chun unauhaiin hlimtakin an mi lo lâwm a."
18,And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.,A zînga chun Paula rawiin Jakob kuomah kan lût a; chutaka chun kohran upahai po po khawm an um a.
19,"And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry.","Chun, Paulain anni chibai a bûk zoin, a rawngbâwlna hmanga Pa- thienin Jentailhai laia thil ân thawtirhai chu a kip a kawiin a hril a."
20,"And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous for the law:","Chun, unauhai chun chuong thu chu an hrietin Pathien an chawi- mawi a; chun, Paula kuoma chun, “Unau, Judahai laia ringtu tamzie i hmuh a; an rêngin Dân chungah ṭhahnem an ngai bawk a."
21,"and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.","Chun, nangin Jentailhai laia Juda umhai po po kuoma chun an nauhai ser tan lo ding le, dân anga um naw ding tiin, Mosie peithlâkna thu în chûktir hlak ti mi bauah an hriet a."
22,What is it therefore? they will certainly hear that thou art come.,Iengtin am ni tâng a ta? I hung tlung ti an hriet ngei âwm sih a.
23,Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men that have a vow on them;,"Chuleiin, i kuoma kan hril ang hin thaw rawh: Thutiem nei pasal pali kan kuomah an um."
24,"these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.","Chuonghai chu ṭhuoi la, anni lai inthien fai ve la, an lu an vaw theina dingin an ta dingin sum sêng rawh: chuongchun, mi po poin mi baua i thu an hriethai kha, a tak a ni naw hrieng an ta, nang ngei Dân hrawin feltakin i um lem a nih hre el an tih."
25,"But as touching the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.","Jentailhai laia ringtu thu chu, milim biekna thil fâk kawnga dâm, sa thisen fâk kawnga dâm, sa râkhlum fâk kawnga dâm, indit kawnga dâm an insukthieng ding a nih, tiin ei rêl a, ei ziek ta kha,” an ta."
26,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.","Chun, a zînga chun Paulain pasalhai chu a ṭhuoi a, anni lai ân thienfai veh a, Pathien biekina chun a lût a, an ta dinga sa that seng ding a pêk pêk hmakhat chu inthienfainain an nei hri ding a nih ti, thiempu kuoma chun an hril lâwk a."
27,"And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,","Chun, ni sari chu a tling vângin Asia rama Judahai chun Paula chu Pathien biekinah an hmuh a, mipui po po an infui a, ama chu an man a,"
28,"crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.","an khêk a, “Israel mihai, mi ṭhangpui ro, hi mipa hi ram tinah mi po po kuomah, Juda mi dâm, Dân dâm, hi in dâm hi hrilsetu kha a nih; chu naw khawm chu Pathien biekina hin Grik mihai khawm a lûtpui a, hi in inthieng hi a suktirdakum tah a nih,” an ta."
29,"For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.","(Chu hma chun khuoa chun Ephesia mi Trophim chu a kuomah an hmuh a, Paulain ama chu Pathien biekina a lûtpui an ring sih a)."
30,"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.","A khuo chun an inlap ta mer mur a, mihai chu an tlân khâwm a. Paula an man a, Pathien biekina inthawk chun an kei dawk a, kawthai chu an khâr nghâl tah a."
31,"And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.","Chun, ama chu sukhlum an tum lai chun Jerusalema mi po po an buoi ti thu chu sipai pâwl hotu laltak kuom a hang tlung a."
32,"And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.","Ama chun sipaihai le sipai za hotuhai a ṭhuoi nghâl tah a, an kuomah a tlân thlah a. Anni chun sipai hotu laltak le sipaihai an hmu chun Paula vuok chu an ma tah a."
33,"Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.","Chun, hotu laltak chun a hung hnai a, Paula a chel a, khaidiet pahni inbuntir ding thu a pêk a; tû am a ni, ieng am a thaw ân dawn a."
34,"And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.","Chun, mipui lai chun a ṭhen thu pakhatin an khêk a, a ṭhen thu dangin an khêk a. Chu, nasêtum lei chun a ziezâng a hriet thei nawh a, kulbîngah ṭhuoi lût ding thu a pêk a."
35,"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;","Chun, Paula kailâwn a tlung laiin mipuiin an thaw nasat leiin sipaihaiin ama chu an dawm kâng pei a;"
36,"for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.","mi po poin, “Sukbohmang ro” tia khêkin an zui hut hut sih a."
37,"And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?","Chun, Paula chu kulbînga chun an ṭhuoi lût ding laiin, ama chun sipai za hotu laltak kuoma chun, “I kuomah thu bau khat hril thei ka ti?” a ta. Ama chun, “Grik ṭawng i hriet maw?"
38,"Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?","Inhmaa mihai infuia, mihriem philhmanghai sângli thlalêra ṭhuoi suoktu Aigupta rama mi kha i ni naw am a nih?” a ta."
39,"But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people.","Paula chun, “Juda mi, Kiliki rama Tarsa khuoa mi ka nih, khaw namêna um ka ni nawh; mi lunginsiet la, mi po po kuomah thu mîn hriltir rawh,” a ta."
40,"And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,","Chun, a remti phingleh, Paula kailâwna chun a ngîr a, mi po po tona dingin kutin a zâp a; chun an to ṭhuop phingleh Hebrai ṭawngin an kuomah:"
