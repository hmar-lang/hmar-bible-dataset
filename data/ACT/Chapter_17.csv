1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:","Chun, Amphipoli le Apollonia an khêl a, Thessalonika an tlung tah a; chutaka chun Judahai inkhâwmna in a um a."
2,"and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures,","Chun, Paula, a dân pângngaiin, an kuomah a lût a, Châwlni vawi thum Pathien Lekha Thua inthawkin nguntakin a suipui a,"
3,"opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, said he, I proclaim unto you, is the Christ.","Krista chu rinum tuor ding a ni hrimzie dâm, mithi laia inthawka thonâwk ding a ni hrimzie dâm a hrilfieh a; a suklang hlak a, “Hi Isu a thu ka hril cheu hi, ama chu Krista a nih,” a ti bawk hlak a."
4,"And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.","Chuongchun, anni laia ṭhenkhat chu zâwrthlûkin an um tah a, Paula le Sila chu an pâwl tah a; Pathien ngaisak Grik mipui nasatak le nuhmei ṭhuoitu tamtak leh."
5,"But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.","Nisienlakhawm, Judahaiin an huphur a; dâwr hmuna mi suol thabo tuhai amanih an kuomah an ṭhuoi a, mipui an ko khâwm a, khuo po po chu an chawkbuoi a, Jason in an hung ṭhâwng a, vântlâng laia ṭhuoi suok tumin."
6,"And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;","Chun, anni chu an hmu nawh a, Jason le unau dang tuhai amanih khaw hotuhai kuomah an kei lût a, an khêk a, “Khawvêl chawk- buoituhai kha hitaka khawm hin an hung a,"
7,"whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Cæsar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.","Jason hin a lo intlungtir vei a; hienghai po po hi, ‘A hming Isu, lal dang a um,’ tiin Kaisar thu kalin an um hlak a nih,” an ta."
8,"And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.","Chun, mipui le khaw hotuhai chun chuong thu chu an hang hriet chun an buoi tah a;"
9,"And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.","chun, Jason le unau danghai kuoma inthawka an aia hrên ding iengkhat an lâk a, an insuo tah a."
10,And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.,"Chun, unauhai chun a zân a zânin Paula le Sila chu Beroia khuoah an infetir nghâl tah a; chutaka an va tlung chun, Judahai inkhâwmna inah an lût a."
11,"Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the scriptures daily, whether these things were so.","Chutaka mihai chu Thes- salonika mihai nêk chun an lo ṭha lem a, chuongchun, lungril lâwmtakin thu chu an pawm a, an thu hril chu ân dik le ân dik naw hrietna dingin ni tin Pathien Lekhaah an zawng hlak a."
12,"Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few.","Chuongchun, chuong mihai tamtak chun an ring tah a; Grik nuhmei inzaumhai le pasalhai khawmin duoiin an ring ta nawh a."
13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.","Nisienlakhawm, Thessalonikaa Judahai chun Paulain Beroia khuoah Pathien thu a hril ti an hriet phingleh, chutaka khawm chun an va feh a, mipuihai an infui a, an buoi nâwk tah a."
14,And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still.,"Chuongchun, unauhaiin tuisuo- riet chena fe dingin Paula chu an tir suok tah a, Sila le Timothe ruok chu chutaka chun an la um zing a."
15,"But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.","Chun, Paula ṭhuoituhai chun Atheni chenin an ṭhuoi a; chun, Sila le Timothe chu inhmawtaka a kuoma fe vakna ding thu incha chu phurin an kîr tah a."
16,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols.","Chun, Paulain Atheniah anni chu a lo nghâk laiin, khuo chu Pathien lima sipin a hmuh a, a lungril a helkam tah a."
17,"So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met him.","Chuongchun, inkhâwmna inah Judahai le Pathien ngaisakhai a sêl hlak a, dâwr hmuna dâm khawm, chutaka hung um taphawthai chu ni tin a lo sêl bawk hlak a."
18,"And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.","Chun, Epikuria mi le Stoik mi laia mi var tuhai amanih khawmin ama chu an hung sêl a, a ṭhenin, “Hi mipa bautam hin ieng am hril a tum a?” an ta. A ṭhenin, (Isu thu le thonâwkna thu a hril leiin,) “Ram dang pathienhai thu hriltu a ni âwm ie,” an ta."
19,"And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?","Chun, ama chu an chel a, Areopagia chun an hung ṭhuoi a, a kuomah, “Hi inchûktirna thar i hril hlak hi mîn hriettir thei i ti?"
20,For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.,"Thilmak ieng amanih kan naah i hung intlun a nih; chuleiin, hieng thil umzie hi hriet kan nuom,” an ta."
21,"(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)","(Athenia mi po po chu, an khuoa mikhuol umhai khawm, an inhman chang taphawt chu thu thar chu hrilin amanih, ngaiin amani bêk an um zing hlak hrim a na)."
22,"And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye are very religious.","Chun, Paula chu Areopagi lai taka chun a ngîr a, a hril a, “Nangni Athenia mihai, iengkimah sakhaw ngaisaktak mi in ni ti ka hriet a."
23,"For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.","Ka lêng malama, chibai in ibûkhai ka en laiin, mâichâm pakhat, a chungah, ‘HRIET NAW PATHIEN TA DING,’ tia ziek ka hmu a nih. Chuongchun, hre loa chibai in ibûk hlak kha, ama thu chu ka hril cheu a ni hi."
24,"The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;","Pathien, khawvêl le a sûnga thil po po siemtu chu, hnuoi le vân lal a ni leiin, kuta bâwl inhaiah a um nawh."
25,"neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;","Thil tlasam angin mihriem kuta rawngbâwlpêkin a um bawk nawh. Ama ngei chu iengkim kuoma hringnahai, inthuoknahai, le thil po po petu chu a ni lem."
26,"and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;","Chun, hnuoi chung po poa um dingin, bul hmunkhatin hnam tin mi a siem a. An ta dingin hun bihai a ruot a, an umna rihai khawm a khang pêk a;"
27,"that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:","Pathien an zawng a, an dap an dap a, an hmu hrâmna dingin; nisienlakhawm, ama chun a mi hlat naw seng si."
28,"for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.","Ama leiin, ei hring, ei châng, ei um a ni sih a; nangni hlaphuokthiem tuhai amani khawmin, ‘Eini khawm a thlahai ei nih,’ tia an hril ang khan."
29,"Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.","Chuongchun, Pathien thlahai ei ni hnung chu, Pathien pangti chu, rângkachak dâm, tangka dâm, lung dâm, mihriem themthiem le remruot- a suthai ang hi amanih ei ti ding a ni nawh."
30,The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:,"Chuongchun, Pathienin ei hriet naw laihai kha hriet naw tehlêm a thaw hlak a; nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu ram tina mi po po sim ding thu a pêk tah a nih, ni a tiem leiin;"
31,"inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.","chu ni chun, a mi ruot chu, hnuoia mihai ro feltakin inrêltir a tih. Chu thu chu, Pathienin ama chu mithi laia inthawka a keithona chun, mi po po kuomah ân hriettir tah a nih,” tiin."
32,"Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.","Chun, mithi laia inthawka thonâwkna thu chu an hriet phingleh a ṭhenin an nuisan a; a ṭhenin, “Hi thu hi i kuomah la ngai nâwk kan tih,” an ta."
33,Thus Paul went out from among them.,"Chuongchun, Paula chu anni laia inthawkin a suok tah a."
34,"But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.","Nisienlakhawm, mi tuhai ama- nih a kuomah an ṭhang ta tlat a, an ring tah a; anni laia ṭhenkhathai chu Areopagia rorêltu pâwla mi Dionusia le, nuhmei pakhat a hming, Damari le, an kuoma mi danghai le chun an nih."
