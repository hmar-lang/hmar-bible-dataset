1,"Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.","Chun, chuong laia inchûktirhai an pung an pung lai chun, an ni tin thil sema chun an hmeithaihai an ngaisak naw leiin Juda, Grik ṭawng hmanghai chu Juda, Hebrai ṭawng hmanghai chungah an lo chier tah a."
2,"And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables.","Chun, sâwm le pahnihai chun inchûktir mipuihai chu an ko a, “Pa- thien thu hril bân sanin, dawkânahai rawng kan bâwl chun ṭha naw nih."

4,"But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word.","Keini ruok chu ṭawngṭai le thu rawngbâwlin um tlat kan tih,” an ta."
5,"And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaüs a proselyte of Antioch;","Chuong thu chun mipui po po chu a suklâwm a; chuongchun, Stephan, ringna le Thlarau Inthienga sip le, Philip, Prokor, Nikanor, Timon, Parmena le Nikol Judahai saphun Antiokei mi leh an thlang a."
6,"whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.","Chuhai chu tirkohai hmaa chun an inngîrtir a, chun, anni chu an ṭawngṭai a, an chungah an kut an innghat a."
7,And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.,"Chun, Pathien thu chu a hung indar a; Jerusalema inchûktirhai an pung ta bêk bêk a; thiempu laia khawm mi tamtak chu ringna awi mi an ni tah a."
8,"And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.","Chun, Stephan chu zaidamna le thilthawtheinain a sip a, mi lai thilmak le inchikna ropuitak a thaw hlak a."
9,"But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called the synagogue of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.","Nisienlakhawm, Sal suokhai, Kurinia mi dâm, Alexandra khuoa mi dâm, inkhâwmna an tia mi ṭhenkhat leh, Kiliki rama mi dâm, Asia ram mi inkhâwmna ina mi ṭhenkhathai an hung inthawk a, Stephan chu an hung sêl a."
10,And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.,"Nisienlakhawm, a varna le a hrilpuitu Thlarau chu an letthlâk thei nawh a."
11,"Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.","Chun, mihai an tham a; chuhai chun, “Mosie le Pathien a hrilsiet kan hriet,” an ta."
12,"And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council,","Chun, mihai, upahai, Dân inchûktirtuhai, an infui a, Stephan an thawh a, an man a, rorêltuhai kuomah an ṭhuoi a."
13,"and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law:","Chun, hretu tehlêmhai an siem a, chuhai chun, “Hi mipa hin In Inthieng le Dân hi a hrilsiet rawp hlak a;"
14,"for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us.","hi Nazareth Isu hin hi In hi ṭhiek a ta, Mosien dân a mi pêkhai kha sukdanglam a tih tiin a hril kan hriet,” an ta."
15,"And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.","Chun, rorêltuhai ṭhung po po chun Stephan an en zing a, a hmêl chu vântirko hmêl angin an hmuh a."
