1,"After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.","Chuong thil hnunga chun Paula chu Athenia inthawk chu a suok a, Korinthah a fe tah a."
2,"And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them;","Chun, a hming Akuila, Juda pakhat a hmuh a, ama chu Ponto rama pieng a nih; Klaudiin Juda po po Roma inthawka suok thu a pêk leiin a nuhmei Priskilla leh Itali rama inthawka hung hlim an nih."
3,"and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought; for by their trade they were tentmakers.","Chun, Paula chu anni ina chun a tlung tah a; chun, an sinthaw ang thaw a ni leiin anni a hrawn a, an kuomah a thaw ve hlak a; an sinthaw chu puon in siem a nih."
4,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.","Châwlni po leh inkhâwmna inah ṭhahnemngaitakin thu a hril hlak a, Judahai le Grikhai chu thlêmthlûk a tum hlak a."
5,"But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.","Chun, Sila le Timothe chu Makedonia rama inthawka an hung thla chun, Paula chu thu hril chauin a um tah a, Isu kha Krista a nih ti Judahai chu a hrilfie a. Nisien- lakhawm, an kalin an hrilpâwi a,"
6,"And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.","Paulân a puon a thin a, an kuomah, “In thina maw chu nangnîn phur ro, kei chu ka hul a nih, tuta chen chu Jentailhai lai fe tâng ka tih,” a ta."
7,"And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.","Chun, chutaka inthawk chun a feh a, a hming Tita Justa mi pakhat inah a lût a, ama chun Pathien a biek hlak a; a in khawm chu inkhâwmna in le inzawm a nih."
8,"And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.","Chun, Krispa, inkhâwmna hotu chun, a sûnghai po po leh Lalpa an ring a, Korinth khuoa mi tamtak khawmin an hriet a, an ring a, baptisma an chang tah a."
9,"And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace:","Chun, zânah Lalpain Paula kuoma chun mang angin, “Ṭi naw la, to loin thu hril pei rawh,"
10,"for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city.","kei i kuomah ka um annâwm, sukna ding chein tukhawmin i chungah kut thlâk naw ni hai; hi khuoa hin mi tamtak ka nei sih a,” a ta."
11,"And he dwelt there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.","Chun, Paula chu chutaka chun, an kuomah Pathien thu inchûktirin kum khat le thla ruk a um a."
12,"But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat,","Chun, Gallio, Akaia rama lal aiawa a um laiin Judahaiin inthu- ruolin Paula an thaw a, rorêlna ṭhungpha hmaah an ṭhuoi a,"
13,"saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.","“Hi mipa hrep hin Dân naw anga Pathien be dingin mi a thlêm- thlûk hlak a nih,” an ta."
14,"But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:","Chun, Paulain a dawn tâwmin, Gallio chun Judahai kuomah, “Judahai, hieng hi thil indiknaw thu amanih bêk ni sienla, matheiloin ngaisak ka ti cheu a;"
15,"but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters.","nisienlakhawm, thuhai, hming- hai, nangni dân chung thuhai mei mei a ni chun, nangnîn rêl lem ro; kei chu chuong ang thu chu ngaituo ka nuom nawh ie,” a ta."
16,And he drove them from the judgment-seat.,"Chun, rorêlna ṭhungphaa in- thawk chun anni chu a hnawt hmang tah a."
17,"And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.","Chun, Grik mihai po poin inkhâwmna in hotu Sosthen an man a, rorêlna ṭhungpha hmaa chun an vuok a. Gallio chun chuong an thilthaw chu ienga khawm a ngai nawh."
18,"And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreæ; for he had a vow.","Chun, chu hnunga chun, Paula chu ni sâwttak a la châm zing a; chu zoa chun, unauhai chu ṭawng- bauṭhain a ṭheh a, chutaka inthawk chu Suria ram tieng lawngin a fe tah a, a kuomah Priskilla le Akuila chu an fe ve bawk a; Paulain thutiem a nei leiin Kenkrieiah a lu a vâw zet a."
19,"And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.","Chun, Ephesi chu an tlung a, chutaka chun anni chu a mâksan tah a; ama ruok chu inkhâwmna inah a lût a, Judahai kuomah ṭhahnem- ngaitakin thu a hril hrih a."
20,"And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not;","Chun, sâwt deu châm dingin an ngên a, nisienlakhawm, a remti nawh a,"
21,"but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.","“Pathienin a phal chun, in kuomah la hung nâwk ka tih,” tiin ṭawngbauṭhain a ṭheh a; Ephesia inthawk chu lawngin a fe tah a."
22,"And when he had landed at Cæsarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.","Chun, lawnga inthawk chu Kaisariah a suok a, Jerusalemah a hang feh a, kohranhai chu chibai a bûk a; chun, chu zoa chun, Antiokeiah a zu fe tah a."
23,"And having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.","Chun, chutaka chun sâwt rei a um hnungin, a fe nâwk a, inchûktir- hai po po sukdetin Galati ram le Phru- gia ram chu a fang suok vawng a."
24,"Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.","Chun, Juda pakhat a hming Apollo, Alexandria khuoa pieng, thuhril theitak, Ephesia chun a zu feh a; ama chun Pathien Lekha thuhai a hriet nasa bêk bêk a."
25,"This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:","Ama chu Lalpa Lam thu in- chûktir tah a na, lungrila ṭhahnem- ngaitak a ni leiin Isu chanchin nguntakin a hril a, ân chuktir hlak a, Johan baptisma thu chau a hriet sih a."
26,"and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.","Chun, inkhâwmna inah huoi- takin thu a hril phut tah a. Chuongchun, Priskilla le Akuila chun a thu hril an hrietin; an inah an ṭhuoi a, a kuomah Pathien Lam thu fel nâwk zuolin an hrilfie tah a."
27,"And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;","Chun, ama chun Akaia rama fe kai a tum phingleh unauhaiin an infui a, ama an lo lâwmna dingin inchûktirhai kuomah lekha an ziekpêk a. Chun, a tlung chun, Pathien lunginsietna leia ringtuhai chu nasatakin a ṭhangpui a."
28,"for he powerfully confuted the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.","Vantlâng hrietin Judahai chu nasatakin a sêldawng a, Pathien Lekha Thu hmangin Isu kha Krista chu a nih ti ân hriettir hlak a."
