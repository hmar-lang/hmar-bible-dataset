1,"But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,","Saula ruok chun, Lalpa in- chûktirhai a vau thu le that a tum thu chu a la sâksuok ta rawp a."
2,"and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.","Thiempu Laltak kuomah a fe a, Damaskaa inkhâwmna in po poa mihai kuoma pêk dingin lekha a hnih a, chu Lama mi chu tukhawm a hmu chun, nuhmei khawm, pasal khawm, Jerusalema khuop puma hung ṭhuoi theina dingin."
3,"And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven:","Chun, a fe laiin, Damaska a tlung tâwmin, kârloin var vâna inthawkin a vêlah a hung var phut a."
4,"and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?","Chun, hnuoiah a tluh a, a kuomah, “Saula, Saula, nangin iengdinga i mi suknawmna am a na?” tiin rawl a hriet a."
5,"And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:","Chun, ama chun, “Tû am i na, Lalpa?” a ta."
6,"but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.","Lalpa chun, “Isu i suknawmnat hi ka nih; nisienlakhawm, tho la, khuoah lût rawh, chuongchun, i thaw ding lo hril an ti che,” a ta."
7,"And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man.","Chun, ama le fehai chu hril ding hre loin an ngir a, rawl chu an hriet a chu tukhawm an hmu si nawh."
8,"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.","Chun, Saula chu hnuoia inthawk chun a tho a; chun, a hang meng a, iengkhawm a hmu thei ta nawh a; chuongchun, a kutah an kei a, Damaskaa chun an ṭhuoi lût a."
9,"And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.","Ni thum khaw hmu loin a um a, iengkhawm a fâkin a dâwn nawh a."
10,"Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.","Chun, Damaskaa chun inchûk- tir pakhat a hming Anania a um a. Lalpa chun a mang angin a kuomah, “Anania,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Lalpa, en ta, hitaka hin ka um,” a ta."
11,"And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth;","Lalpa chun a kuomah, “Tho la, kawtthlêr, ‘Tlûn’ an tia chun fe la, Juda inah, Tarsa khuoa mi, a hming Saula indawn suok rawh; ngai ta, a ṭawngṭai zing a nih,"
12,"and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.","a hming Anania mi pakhat lûta, a mit sukvar dingin a chunga kut innghatin a hmu tah,” a ta."
13,"But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem:","Chun, Anania chun, “Lalpa, chu mipa chu Jerusalema i mi inthieng- hai chunga a suksuol tamzie thu mi tamtak baua inthawkin ka hriet a nih."
14,and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.,"Hitaka khawm i hming lam taphawt chu khuop dingin thiempu lalhaia inthawkin thu a hmu zing annâwm,” a ta, a dawn a."
15,"But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel:","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpa chun a kuomah, “Fe el rawh, Jentailhai, lalhai, Israel thlahai kuoma ka hming put lûtna dinga ka bêl ruot a nih."
16,for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name’s sake.,"Ka hming leiin rinum ieng anga nasa am a tuor ding a kuomah lân hriettir ka tih,” a ta."
17,"And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.","Chun, Anania chu a va feh a, ina chun a lût a; a chungah kut ân nghat a, “Unau Saula, i mit varna ding le Thlarau Inthieng sipa i um theina dingin, Lalpa, i hungna lampuia i kuoma inlâr Isu khan a mi hung tir a nih,” a ta."
18,"And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized;","Chun, kârloin a mita inthawk chun phuhlip ang ieng amanih a tla nghâl tah a, a mit a var nâwk tah a; chun, a tho a, baptisma a chang tah a."
19,and he took food and was strengthened. And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus.,"Chun, bu a fâk a, a har nâwk tah a. Chun, Damaskaa inchûktir umhai kuoma chun ni iengzat amanih a um a."
20,"And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.",Inkhâwmna inhaia chun Isu chu Pathien Naupa a nizie thu a khêkpui nghâl tah a.
21,"And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havoc of them that called on this name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests.","Chun, a thu hretuhai po po chun mak an ti hleh a; “Hi mipa hi Jerusalema hi hming lamtuhai suknawmna hlaktu kha a ni naw am a nih? Chuong mihai chu thiempu lalhai kuoma khuop puma ṭhuoi, a hung san a ni kha,” an ta."
22,"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.","Saula ruok chu a hung hrât nâwk zuol a, ama chu Krista a ni takzet ti a hrilfieh a, Damaskaa Juda umhai chu a sêldawng rawp hlak a."
23,"And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him:","Chun, ni sâwt tak hnunga chun Saula sukhlum dingin Judahai chu an inrawn a;"
24,but their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him:,"nisienlakhawm, ama chun an thurawt chu a lo hriet tah a. Sukhlum dingin kul kawtkhâr tina chun a sûn a zânin an inchân hlak a."
25,"but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.","Nisienlakhawm, a închûktir- haiin ama chu an ṭhuoi a, zânah kul tukverah bâwmin an thlâk thla tah a."
26,"And when he was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.","Chun, Saula chun Jerusalem a tlung phingleh inchûktirhai chu pâwl a tum a; anni ruok chun an rêngin ama chu an ṭih a, inchûktir a ni ve ti an ring nawh a."
27,"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.","Barnaba ruok chun ama chu a ṭhuoi a, tirkohai kuoma chun a hungpui a, lampuia Lalpa a hmua a biekzie dâm, Damaskaa Isu hminga huoitaka a thu a hrilzie dâm khawm chu an kuomah a hril tah a."
28,"And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem,","Chuongchun, Saula chu Jeru- salema chun an kuoma lût hlak suok hlakin a um tah a, Lalpa hmingin huoitakin thu a hril hlak a."
29,preaching boldly in the name of the Lord: and he spake and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.,"Chun, Grik ṭawng hmang Judahai lai thu a hril a, a sêl a; anni ruok chun ama chu sukhlum an tum a."
30,"And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.","Chun, unauhai chun chu chu an hrietin, Kaisari khuoah an ṭhuoi thlâk a, Tarsa khuoah an tir ta dai a."
31,"So the church throughout all Judæa and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was multiplied.","Chuongchun, kohranhai chu Judai ram vêla dâm, Galili ram vêla dâm, Samari ram vêla dâm chun an det deu deu a, muongtakin an um tah a; chun, Lalpa ṭi dêkin, Thlarau Inthieng ithlamuongin an um a, an hung pung ta deu deu a."
32,"And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.","Chun, Peterin khawvêl a fang malamin, Ludda khuoa mi inthieng umhai kuomah a zu fe bawk a."
33,"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied.","Chutaka chun mi pakhat, a hming Ainia a zeng leia kum riet khuma zâl zing a hmuh a."
34,"And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And straightway he arose.","Chun, Peter chun a kuomah, “Ainia, Isu Krista chun a sukdam che; tho la i puonpha ziel rawh,” a ta. Chuongchun, a tho nghâl tah a."
35,"And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.","Chun, Ludda khuo le Saron phaia um po pohai chun Ainia chu an hmuh a, Lalpa tieng an ngha tâwl tah a."
36,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.","Chun, Joppa khuoah a hming Tabitha, inchûktir pakhat a um a, (Tabitha umzie chu Dorka a nih); chu nuhmei chun thil thawṭhat le thilpêk a hau hleh a."
37,"And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.","Chun, chuong lai chun a damnawh a, a thi tah a; chun an insil fai a, pindan chunghnungah an inzâl a."
38,"And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us.","Chun, Ludda khuo chu Joppa khaw kâwl a ni leiin, inchûktirhai chun Peter chutaka chun a um ti an hriet a, “Sâwt riel loin kan kuomah hung rawh,” tia ngên dingin a kuomah mi pahni an tir a."
39,"And Peter arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.","Chun, Peter chu a tho a, anni leh a fe ve tah a. Chun, a tlung phingleh pindan chunghnunga chun an ṭhuoi a; hmeithai po po chu a kâwla ngîrin, Dorka an kuoma a um laia a zakuo siemhai, a puon siemhai inentir pumin an ṭap tâwl a."
40,"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter chun an rêngin ân suoktir vawng a, a dingṭhaṭhuon a, a ṭawngṭai tah a; chun, ruong tieng chu a nghah a, “Tabitha, tho rawh,” a ta. Chuong- chun, a mit a hung meng a, Peter chu a hmu phingleh a ṭhung tah a."
41,"And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.","Chun, Peter chun a kut a pêk a, a keitho tah a; chun, mi inthienghai le hmeithaihai chu a ko a, damin a khîkhmuh a."
42,And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord.,"Chun, chu chu Joppa khuo po po chun an hriet ta vawng a; mi tamtakin Lalpa chu an ring tah a."
43,"And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.","Chun, Peter chu ni tamtak Joppa khuoa Simon, savun siemtu inah a châm zing a."
