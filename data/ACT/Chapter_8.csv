1,"And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judæa and Samaria, except the apostles.","Chu ni chun, kohran Jerusalema umhai chu miin nasatakin an suknawmna phut tah a; chuongchun, tirkohai bak naw chu Judai le Samari ram khaw tinah an indar ta vawng a."
2,"And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.","Chun, Pathien ngaisak tuhaiin amanih Stephan chu an phûm a, nasatakin an ṭap a."
3,"But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.","Saula ruok chun kohranhai chu a suknawmna bêk bêk a, in tinah a lût a, a nuhmei a pasalin a hnûk dawk a, intângna inah a khum hlak."
4,They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word.,"Chun, ân darhai chu khaw tinah an feh a, thu chu an hril pei a."
5,"And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.","Chun, Philip chu Samari khuoah a zu feh a, an kuomah Krista thu a khêk pui a."
6,"And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.","Mipuihaiin a thu an hriet a, a thilmak thawhai an hmu chun Philip thu hril chu lungril hmunkhatin an ngaisak a,"
7,"For from many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.","khawhri inthiengnawhai chu mi tamtak an imanhai sûnga inthawkin rawl inringtaka khêka an suok leiin le, zeng le keinbai tamtak khawm an hung dam ta leiin."
8,And there was much joy in that city.,"Chun, chu khuoa chun nasatakin an lâwm tah a."
9,"But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:","Chun, a hming Simon, mi pakhat a um a; ama chun, chu khuoa chun dawi hmangin Samari khuoa mihai maktitakin a lo siem ta hlak a."
10,"to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.","Mi po po chun mi setaka inthawka ân laltak chenin, “Hi mipa hi Pathien thilthawtheina, ‘Ropui,’ an ti kha a ni hi,” tiin a thu an ngaisak tâwl hlak."
11,"And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.",A dâwi hmangin sâwttak mak titaka a siem hlak leiin a thu an ngaisak a nih.
12,"But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun Pathien ram chanchin ṭha le Isu Krista hming Chanchin Ṭha Philip hril chu an âwi phingleh, a nuhmei a pasalin baptisma an chang tah a."
13,"And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.","Chun, Simon rau khawmin a âwi ve tah a, chun baptisma a chang zo chun, Philip kuomah a um zing a. Inchikna le thilmak nasatak thawa umhai chu a hmu veh a, mak a ti hle hlak a."
14,"Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:","Chun, tirko Jerusalema umhai khan Samari khuoa mihaiin Pathien thu an awi ti an hrietin, an kuomah Peter le Johan chu an tir a."
15,"who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:",Anni chu an zuk tlung chun Thlarau Inthieng an hmu theina dingin an ṭawngṭaipêk a.
16,for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.,Chu hma chun anni laia tu chunga khawm a la tlung nawh; Lal Isu hmingin baptisma an chang chau a la nih.
17,"Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.","Chun, an chungah an kut an innghat a, Thlarau Inthieng an hmu tah a."
18,"Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,","Chun, tirkohai kut innghat leia Thlarau Inthieng pêk a nih ti Simonin a hmuh a,"
19,"saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.","“Hi thuneina hi mi pe ve ro, tû chunga khawm kut kân nghatna taphawtin Thlarau Inthieng an hmu vena dingin,” tiin an kuomah tangka pêk a tum a."
20,"But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin a kuomah, “I tangka hi nanga ruolin bohmang raw se, Pathien thilpêk tangka suma inchâwk i tum leiin."
21,Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.,"Hieng thua hin i ṭhang ve nawh, chan khawm i nei bawk nawh; i lungril Pathien ngaiin a fel nawh."
22,"Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.","Chuleiin, i suol hi sim la, Lalpa kuomah ṭawngṭai rawh, chuongchun, i lungrila i ngaituo hi a ngaidam che rawi mawh."
23,For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.,"Thil khâkna mîta le, suol khuop thlûkna hmunah i um ti ka hriet a nih,” a ta."
24,"And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.","Chun, Simonin, “In thil hril hi ka chunga iengkhawm a tlung nawna dingin nangnîn Lalpa kuomah mi ṭawngṭaipêk ro,” a ta, a dawn a."
25,"They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.","Chuongchun, anni chun Lalpa thu chu an inhriettira an hril zoin, Jerusalemah an fe nâwk tah a; Samari rama mihai khaw tamtak kuomah Chanchin Ṭha chu an hril pei a."
26,"But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.","Chun, Lalpa vântirko pakhatin Philip chu a biek a, “Tho la, sim tienga Jerusalema inthawka Gaza zuk sun lampuia khan fe rawh, chu lampui chu thlalêra fe thleng a nih,” a ta."
27,"And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;","Chuongchun, a tho a, a fe tah a. Chun, ngai ta, Ethiopia rama mi pakhat, Ethiopia lalnu Kandaki hnuoia mitillâk inlaltak, a ro po po enkawltu, Jerusalemah Pathien be dingin a hang feh a."
28,"and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.",A hung tieng chun a tawlailîra ṭhung pumin zâwlnei Isai lekhabu a tiem pei a.
29,"And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.","Chun, Thlarau chun Philip kuomah, “Saw tawlailîr saw va hnai la, va pâwl rawh,” a ta."
30,"And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?","Chun, Philip chu mitillâk kuoma chun a va tlân a, zâwlnei Isai lekhabu a tiem a hriet a, “I tiem kha a umzie i hriet am?” a ta."
31,"And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.","Ama chun, “Tukhawmin an mi hrilfie naw chun, iengtin am hre thei ka ta?” a ta. Chun, a kuoma hung ṭhung dingin Philip chu a fiel tah a."
32,"Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:","Pathien Lekha a tiem lai chu hi hi a nih:- “That dingin berâm angin ama chu an ṭhuoi a; Berâmtê a hmul vâwtu hmaa a to zing angin, Ama khawmin a bau a ka nawh;"
33,In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth.,"A tlâwm laiin a rorêlna chu lâkpêkin a um a; A thlahai chanchin tuin am hril tâng an ta? Khawvêla inthawkin a hringna an lâkpêk ta sih a,” ti hi."
34,"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?","Chun, mitillâk chun Philip a biek a, a kuomah, “Zâwlneiin hieng thu hi tû thu am a na a hril, ama thu am a ni, mi dang thu? kân dawn che,” a ta."
35,"And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.","Philip chun a hril a, chu Pathien Lekha Thu chu a bulah a phut a, a kuomah Isu thu a hril a."
36,"And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?","Chun, lampuia an fe malamin tui ieng amanih an tlung a; chun, mitillâk chun, “En ta, hitaka hi tui a um, baptisma changna ding iengin am a mi hluo kher leh?” a ta."
37,,"[Chun, Philip chun, “I lungril po poa i ring chun, i chang thei,” a ta. Ama chun, “Isu Krista chu Pathien Naupa a ni ka ring,” a ta, a dawn a]."
38,"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.","Chun, tawlailîr chu ân ngîrtir a, an pahni chun, Philip le mitillâk chu tuia chun an zu feh a; chun, Philip chun ama chu a baptis tah a."
39,"And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.","Tuia inthawk chu an hang suok phingleh, Lalpa Thlarau chun Philip chu a lâk hmang tah a; mitillâk chun ama chu a hmu nâwk ta nawh a, nisienlakhawm, hlimtakin a fe ta pei a."
40,"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea.","Philip chu miin Azota khuoah an hmu nâwk tah a; chun, a fe thleng a, Kaisari khuo a tlung hmakhat chun, khaw tinah Chanchin Ṭha chu a hril pei a."
