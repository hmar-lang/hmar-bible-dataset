1,"And the high priest said, Are these things so?","Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun, “Hieng thu hi ân dik am?” a ta."
2,"And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,","Chun, Stephan chun, “Unauhai, pahai ngai ta u, ei thlatu Abraham Harana a um hmaa, Mesopotamia rama a um lai khan Ropuina Pathien chu a kuomah a hung inlâr a,"
3,"and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.","a kuomah, ‘I khuo tieng le i chihai laia inthawkin suok la, ram ka lân entir ding che tieng chun fe rawh,’ a ta."
4,"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldæans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, God removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell:","Chun, ama chu Kaldaihai rama inthawkin a suok a, Haranah a va um tah a; chun, a pa a thi hnungin chutaka inthawkin hi tuta in umna khuo tieng hin Pathienin ân pêm lûttir a."
5,"and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.","Chun, hitaka hin chu iengkhawm hmun hluo ding, a ke innghatna khawp khawm a pêk nawh a; nisienlakhawm, ama le a hnunga a thlahai chena ro dingin pêk a tiem a, nau a la nei hma ngei khawmin."
6,"And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years.","“Chun, Pathienin hieng ang hin a hril:- ‘A thlahai mi khuo tieng kum za li thang an tih, miin suokah siem an ta,suknawmna bawk an tih,’ tiin."
7,"And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.","Chun, Pathienin, ‘Suoka neitu ding hnam chu keiin la ngaituong ka tih, chun,chu zoa chun hung suok an ta, hi hmuna hin ka rawng la bâwl an tih,’ a ti bawk a."
8,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.","Chun, Pathienin a kuomah ser- tan thu kha a thlung a, chuongchun, Abraham chun, Isak a hung nei a, a ni riet niah a ser a tan a; chun Isak chun Jakob a nei a, Jakob chun chi thlatu sâwm le pahnihai kha a hung nei tah a."
9,"And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,","“Chun, chi thlatuhai khan Josef an îtthik a, Aigupta tieng an zawr a, nisienlakhawm, Pathien a kuomah a um a."
10,"and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.","A rinum tuor po poah a san suok pei a, Aigupta ram lal Pharao khawm ân lunginsiettir a, mi vartak a ni ti ân hriettir bawk a. Chuongchun, ama chun Aigupta ram le a ina mi po po chungah hotuin a siem tah a."
11,"Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.","“Chun, Aigupta le Kanaan ram po poa chun ṭâm a hung tlah a, rinum nasatak a hung tlung tah a; ei thlatuhai chun fâk ding hrim hrim an hmu ta nawh a."
12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.","Nisienlakhawm, Jakob chun Aiguptaah bu a um ti a hriet phingleh ei thlatuhai chu a tir suok a; chu chu an fe phutna tak a nih."
13,And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s race became manifest unto Pharaoh.,"Chun, an fe a vawi hninaa chun, Josef chu a unauhai kuoma chun ân hriettir a, chun Josef unauhai chu Pharao an inhriettir tah a."
14,"And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.","Chun, Josef chun a pa Jakob le a unau po po ân kotir a; anni chu sâwmsari le panga an nih."
15,"And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;","Chuongchun, Jakob chu Ai- gupta ramah a zu feh a, chutaka chun ama le ei thlatuhai chu an thi tah a,"
16,"and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.","Sekem khuo an zâwn tlung a, Abrahamin Sekem khuoa Hamor naupahai kuoma thlân, tangka suma a inchâwka khan an phûm tah a."
17,"But as the time of the promise drew nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,","“Chun, Pathienin Abraham kuoma thu a tiem kha a hung tlung hun chu a tlung dingin, mihai chu Aiguptaa chun an pung a, an tam ta deu deu a,"
18,"till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.",Josef hre naw lal dang a hung um chen khan.
19,"The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live.","Ama chun ei chihai chu a zai- hlêm a, a suknawmna a, an nautêhai dam lo dingin ân pei suoktir hlak."
20,"At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father’s house:","Chu lai chun, Mosie a hung pieng a, a hmêl a ṭha bêk bêk a, a pa inah thla thum an châwm a."
21,"and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.","Chun, an pei suok chun Pharao naunu chun a lâk a, ama nau dingin a châwm tah a."
22,And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.,"“Chun, Mosie chu Aigupta mihai varna po po an inchûktir a, a thu le a thilthawah a ropui bêk bêk a."
23,"But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.","Chun, ama chu kum sâwmli a tling ding vêlin a unau Israel thlahai chu kan a tum a."
24,"And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian:","Chun, anni laia mi pakhat sukrinum tuor lai a hmuh a, a san a, suknawmnatna tuortu phuba chu a lâk a, Aigupta mi chu a sukhlum tah a."
25,and he supposed that his brethren understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not.,"Mosie chun ama kutin Pa- thienin anni a sanhim ding ti a unauhaiin an hriet amanih a ta, nisienlakhawm, an hriet si nawh."
26,"And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?","Chun, a zîngah anni laia mi pahni an insuol laiin an kuom a hung tlung a, ‘Puhai, unau in nih annâwm; iengdinga indiknawtakin in inthaw am?’ tiin anni rem a tum a."
27,"But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?","Nisienlakhawm, a ruolpa chunga a kawmawpa lem chun Mosie a nampei a, ‘Kan chungah rorêltu le hotuin tuin am a siem cheh a?"
28,"Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?","Zânita Aigupta mi i sukhlum ang khan, mi sukhlum i tum a ni maw?’ a ta."
29,"And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.","Chun, chu thu lei chun Mosie a tlân hmang a, Median ramah a thang zing a, chutaka chun naupasal pahni a nei a."
30,"And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.","Chun, kum sâwmli a tling hnungin Sinai tlâng thlalêrah chîmbukah meichawk lai vântirko pakhat a kuomah ân lâr a."
31,"And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord,","Chun, Mosiein a hmu chun, a thil hmu chu mak a ti êm a; chun, en dinga a va hnai laiin, Lalpa rawlin,"
32,"I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold.","‘Kei i thlatuhai Pathien ka nih, Abraham Pathien, Isak Pathien, Jakob Pathien chu,’ a lo tih a. Chuongchun, Mosie chu ân thin a, a en ngam ta nawh a."
33,"And the Lord said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.","Chun, Lalpa chun a kuomah, ‘I kephaa inthawkin i kekawk kha sût rawh, i ngîrna hmun kha hnuoi inthieng a nih."
34,"I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt.","Aiguptaa ka mi umhai chu an rimsikzie ka hmu zing a, anni sanhim dingin ka hung ṭum a nih. Hung ta, Aiguptaah tir ka ti che,’ a ta."
35,"This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.","“Chu Mosie, ‘Hotu le rorêltu dingin tuin am a siem cheh a?’ tia an sêl chu, chîmbuka vântirko a kuoma inlâr khan a ṭhangpui a, Pathienin ama ngei chu hotu le sanhimtu ni fâwm dingin a tir a nih."
36,"This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.","Ama chun Aiguptaa dâm, Tuisuoriet Sena dâm, thlalêra dâm chun kum sâwmli sûngin thilmak le inchiknahai inhmutirin anni a ṭhuoi suok tah a."
37,"This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me.","“Israel thlahai kuomah ‘Pa- thienin kei a mi siem ang hin, in unauhai laia mi zâwlnei pakhat siempêk a ti cheu,’ titu kha a nih, chu Mosie chu."
38,"This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us:",Ama chu thlalêra pungkhâwm- hai laia Sinai tlânga betu vântirko kuoma le ei thlatuhai kuoma um kha a nih; ama chu a mi pêk sâwng dinga thu hringhai latu kha a nih.
39,"to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt,","Ei thlatuhai chun a thu an zâwm nuom nawh a, an sêl a, an lungrilhai chu Aigupta ram tieng a lêt nâwk tah a."
40,"saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.","Aron kuomah, ‘Kan hmaṭhuoitu dingin pathienhai mi siempêk rawh, Mosie Aiguptaa mi ṭhuoi suoktu hlak hi a chanchin kan hriet ta si nawh a,’ an ta."
41,"And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.","Chun, chuonghai chun se- bâwngte lim an siem a, a lim chu ran thatin an biek a, anni kutsuok chunga chun an hlim tah a."
42,"But God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?","Chuongchun, Pathienin a nghat san a, vâna arasihai chibai an bûk theina dingin anni a ensan tah a; Zâwlnei Lekhabua, ‘Israel chihai, thlalêra khan kum sâwmli sûngin, Sa that le ran thatin kei in mi biek am a nih?"
43,"And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, And the star of the god Rephan, The figures which ye made to worship them: And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.","Molok puon in le pathien Rephan arasi khawm chu, Chibai bûk dingin a lim in siemhai kha, In zâwm lem hlak a; Chuleiin, Babulon khaw khêl tieng Ṭhuoi hmang ka ti cheu,’ ti ziek ang khan."
44,"Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.","“A lim a hmu anga siem dinga Mosie hriltuin a ruot ang khan, ei thlatuhaiin thlalêra khan inhriet- tirna puon in chu an nei a."
45,"Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;","Chu bawk chu ei thlatuhai thla nâwk khawmin an nei sâwng pei a, Pathienin ei thlatuhai hmaa Jentail a hnawt suokhai ram an hluo lai khan Josua lût ruolin an lûtpui a; David hung um chen khan chutaka chun a um ta zing a."
46,"who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.","Chu David chu Pathien mithmuin ditsak tlâkin a um a, Jakob Pathien ta dinga umna ding siempêk a hnih a."
47,But Solomon built him a house.,"Nisienlakhawm, Solomonin in chu a bâwlpêk ta lem a."
48,"Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in houses made with hands; as saith the prophet,","Nisienlakhawm, Achunghnung- tak chu kuta bâwl inhaiah a um ngai nawh; zâwlnei chun:-"
49,"The heaven is my throne, And the earth the footstool of my feet: What manner of house will ye build me? saith the Lord: Or what is the place of my rest?","Lalpain, ‘Vân ka ṭhungpha a na, Hnuoi ka kepha innghatna a nih; In ieng angin am mi bâwlpêk in ta? Ka châwlna hmun khawm ieng am a na?"
50,Did not my hand make all these things?,"Keia kutin hieng thil iengkim hi ka siem naw am a nih? a tih, ti ziek ang khan."
51,"Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye.","“Mi kâwmawhai, lungril le na tan nawhai, kumkhuoin Thlarau Inthieng hi in kal rawp el; in thlatuhai thaw ang pei khan in thaw hlak."
52,Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers;,"In thlatuhaiin zâwlnei lai an suknawmnat naw tu am an um a? Mi feltak hung ding thu hril lâwktuhai kha an sukhlum a; chun, Mi Takzet chu inmantirtu le thattuhai nangni tuhin in nih in sawnnaw."
53,"ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.","Vântirkohai ipêk sâwng Dân kha hmu zeta zâwm si lohai,” a ta."
54,"Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.","Chun, chuong thu chu an hrietin an lungril a khei tah a, Stephan chunga chun an ha an rawt a."
55,"But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu Thla- rau Inthienga sip a na, vân tieng a en tlat a, Pathien ropuizie le Pathien changtienga Isu ngir a hmuh a,"
56,"and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.","“Ngai ta u, vân inhawnghai ka hmuh a, Pathien changtienga Mi- hriem Naupa ngîr khawm ka hmuh,” a ta."
57,"But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord;","Chun, anni chu rawl inring- takin an khêk a, an na an hip a, inthuruolin an thawh a."
58,"and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.","Khuoa inthawk chu an hnawt- suok a, lungin an dêng a. A hretuhai chun tlangvâl pakhat a hming Saula ke bula chun an puonhai an sie tâwl a."
59,"And they stoned Stephen, calling upon the Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.","Chuongchun, Stephanin, “Lal Isu, ka thlarau la rawh,” tia Lalpa a ko laiin lungin an dêng mur mur a."
60,"And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.","Chun, a dingṭhaṭhuon a, rawl inringtakin a khêk a, “Lalpa, hi an thil suksuol hi an chungah maw inphurtir naw rawh,” a ta. Chu thu chu a hril zo phingleh a ininnghil tah a. Saula khawm chun a thi chu a remtih a."
