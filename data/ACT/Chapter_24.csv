1,"And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and with an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.","Chun, ni nga chenah Thiempu Laltak Anani a hung tlung thlah a, upa tuhai amanih leh, a hming Tertulla thuhril thiem pakhat leh; chun, Paula chunga thupawi chu Bawrsâp kuomah an hril a."
2,"And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation,","Chun, Paula chu an ko suok hnung chun, Tertulla chun ama a hêk phut a, “Felik ṭha tak, nangma zârin thlamuongtakin kan um lei le, i enkawl leia hi chihai ta dinga suolhai chu khap ṭhata a um hlak leiin,"
3,"we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.",kumkhuoin khâwlai khawm lungawitakin kan lâwm hlak.
4,"But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.","Iengkhawm ni sienla, i ta dinga nghawkum taluo ni ka nuom nawh a, I nunnêmnain thu baukhat ruok chu mi ngaipêk dingin ka hni che a nih."
5,"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:","Hi mipa hi mi theidaumtak, khawvêla Judahai po po chawkbuoitu le, Nazareth pâwla a ṭhuoitu pakhat a nih ti kan hriet a."
6,who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold:,"Pathien biekin sukthieng naw a tum bawk a, chuleiin, kan man a nih; [kan dân anga a chungthu rêl kan nuom a,"
7,,"nisienlakhawm, sipai hotu tak Lusia a hung a, ka kuta mi chu a hung ṭhuoi lui tah a."
8,"from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.","Ama hêktuhai chu i hmaa inlang ding thu a pêk bawk a.] Nang ngeiin suosal la, kan hêkna thil po po hi amaa inthawkin hre thei i tih,” a ta."
9,"And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.","Judahai khawm chun, “Chuong thu chu chuong ang tak chu a nih,” tiin an lo ṭhangpui a."
10,"And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defence:","Chun, Bawrsâp chun thu hril dinga Paula chu kuta a zâp phingleh, ama chun, “Nang kum tamtak hi chihai rorêl pêktu i nih ti ka hriet leiin lâwmtakin ka thiemna thu ka hril ding a ni hi."
11,seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:,Jerusalema Pathien be dinga ka hang fe chen chu ni sâwm le pahni bâk la ni naw nih ti hre thei i tih.
12,"and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.","Pathien biekina khawm, inkhâwmna inahai khawm khuoa khawm tukhawm ka sêl le mipui kân fui annîn an mi hmu bawk nawh,"
13,Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.,tu khawm hin an mi hêkna thu hi i hrietah a bula inthawkin sui suok thei bawk naw ni hai.
14,"But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;","Nisienlakhawm, hi thu hi i kuomah inphuong ka tih, ‘Chi hran,’ an ti, Lam dân angin ei thlatuhai Pathien ka biek hlak, Dân le zâwl- neihai lekhabua ziek po po ringin."
15,"having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.","Chun, mi fel le felnaw thonâwk- na um a tih ti Pathien tieng ka beisei a, hienghai khawm hin chu chu an awi ve bawk si."
16,Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.,"Chuleichun, Pathien kuom tienga le mihriem tienga khawm lungril suol naw mawl hi vawn tlat ka tum hlak."
17,"Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:","Chun, kum tamtak hnunga hin ka chipuihai lai thilpêk ding chawiin, inthâwina inhlân dingin ka hung a."
18,"amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but there were certain Jews from Asia—","Chuong lai chun, mipui le, nasêtum um loin, Pathien biekinah insukthiengin an mi hmuh a."
19,"who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.","Nisienlakhawm, chutaka chun Asia rama mi Juda tuhai amanih an um kha, chuonghai chun ka chungah thu an nei chun, hitaka hin i hmaa umin an mi hêk ding a nih."
20,"Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,","Annawleh, hienghai ngei hin rorêltu hmaa ka ngîr lai khan, ka suksuol ieng am an hmuh a, hril raw hai se,"
21,"except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.","anni laia ngîrin, hi thu baukhat, ‘Mithi thonâwkna thuah vawisûn hin in hmaah suosalin ka um a ni hi,’ ka ti lei kha a ni nghâl naw chun,” a ta, a dawn a."
22,"But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.","Chun, Felik chun Lam thu chu a hriet fel deu leiin, “Sipai hotu laltak Lusia chu a hung tlung thla pha in thu la rem ka tih,” tiin a sie ta hrih a."
23,"And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.","Chun, Paula chu duot deua, a ruolhai rawngbâwlpêk khap loa invêngtir dingin sipai za hotu chu thu a pêk a."
24,"But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.","Chun, ni iengzât chena manih Felik chu a hung nâwk a, a nuhmei Drusilla Juda nuhmei leh, Paula chu ân kotir a, Krista Isu ringna thu chu a ngai a."
25,"And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.","Paula chun, felna thu dâm, insûm thu dâm, ro a la rêl ding thu dâm ṭhahnemngaitaka a hril laiin Felik chun ṭium a ti bêk a, “Fe nâwk phawt ta rawh, hun remchâng ka nei pha ko ka ti che,” a ta."
26,"He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.","Paulain tangka a pêk a beisei bawk a, chuleiin, a ko inzing deu a, a biek hlak a nih."
27,"But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.","Chun, kum hni ân vawi hnungin Porkia Festain Felik chu a thleng tah a; Felik chun Judahai laia hmingṭhat a nuom a, Paula chu khuop sain a mâksan tah a."
