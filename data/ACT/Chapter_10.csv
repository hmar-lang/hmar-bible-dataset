1,"Now there was a certain man in Cæsarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,","Chun, Kaisari khuoah a hming Korneli mi pakhat a um a; Itali pâwl an ti, chu pâwla sipai za hotu a nih."
2,"a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.","Pathien ngaisak mi a na, a sûnghai po po leh Pathien an ṭi hlak a; mihai kuomah thil tamtak a pêk hlak a, Pathien kuoma khawm an ṭawngṭai rawp a."
3,"He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.","Ama chun chawhnung inher hin, mang angin fietakin Pathien vântir- ko pakhat a kuoma lûta, “Korneli,” tiin a hmuh a."
4,"And he, fastening his eyes upon him, and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God.","Chun, Korneli chun ama chu a lo en zing a, a ṭih a, “Lalpa, ieng am a na?” a ta. Chun, ama chun a kuomah, “I ṭawngṭainahai le i thil pêk thuhai kha hriet zing dingin Pathien hmaah a hang tlung tah."
5,"And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:","Tuhin Joppa khuoah mihai tir la, mi pakhat Simon Peter an ti chu, hang inṭhuoitir rawh."
6,"he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side.","Savun siemtu Simon kuoma tlung a nih, a in chu tuisuoriet pangah a um,” a ta."
7,"And when the angel that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;","Chun, vântirko a betu chu a fe phingleh, Korneli chun, a siehlawhai laia mi pahni le a rawngbâwl rawphai laia Pathien ngaisak sipai pakhat a ko a;"
8,"and having rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.","chun, thu po po chu an kuoma a hril zoin Joppa khuoa chun a tir tah a."
9,"Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:","Chun, a zînga an fe laia khaw kâwl an tlung laiin, Peter chu ṭawngṭai dingin, sûnbu fâk hun laiin, in chungah a hang lawn a."
10,"and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance;","Chun a phîng a hung ṭâm a, bu fâk a nuom tah a; nisienlakhawm, fâk ding an siem lai chun zêlin a um tah a."
11,"and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth:","Vân inhawngin, iengkhat bâwm puon lientak ang, a ki palia khita, hnuoiah inkhaithlain a hmuh a."
12,wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven.,"Chu sûnga chun sapheimanli- hai le, thilhring le chunga vate tinrênghai an um a."
13,"And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.","Chun, a kuomah rawlin, “Peter tho rawh; that la fa rawh,” a hung tih a."
14,"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter chun, “Lalpa, ni lo e; thiengnaw le, inthiengnaw iengkhawm ka fâk ngai nawh ie,” a ta."
15,"And a voice came unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.","Chun, rawl chun vawihninaah, “Pathienin a sukthieng ta chu nangin thiengnaw ti naw rawh,” a ta."
16,And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven.,"Chuong ang ruok chun, vawi thum a hung um a; chun, bâwm chu vâ- na zuk khaiin a um nâwk nghâl tah a."
17,"Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s house, stood before the gate,","Chun, Peterin mang anga a hmu chu a ngaina hre loa a lunginzîng laiin, Korneli mi tirhai chun Simon in chu an lo indawn suok tah a, kawtkhâr bulah an lo ngîr a,"
18,"and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there.","an khêk a, Simon, Peter an ti chu, chutaka chun a tlung le tlung naw an indawn a."
19,"And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.","Chun, Peterin a mang thu chu a ngaituo laiin, Thlarauin a kuomah, “Ngai ta, mi pathumin an zawng che."
20,"But arise, and get thee down, and go with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them.","Chuongchun, tho la, ṭum la, iengkhawm ringhla loin anni zui rawh; anni chu ka itir an nih,” a ta."
21,"And Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?","Chuongchun, Peter chu chuhai kâwla chun a ṭum a, an kuomah, “In izawng hi ka nih; ieng am in hungna san?” a ta."
22,"And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and one that feareth God, and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews, was warned of God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee.","Anni chun, “Vântirko inthieng pakhatin, Korneli, sipai za hotu mi feltak, Pathien ṭi Juda hnam po pohai khawma an ingaisâng kuoma chun, i thu hril a hrietna dingin, a inah nang ko ding chein a hril a nih,” an ta."
23,"So he called them in and lodged them. And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.","Chuongchun, mihai chu a ko lût a, ân riek tir tah a. A zînga chun Peter chu a tho a, an kuomah a feh a, Joppa khuoa mi unau tuhai amani khawm anni leh an fe veh a."
24,"And on the morrow they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends.","Chun, a zing nâwk chun Kaisari khuoa chun an lût tah a. Chun, Korneli chun a laibunghai le a ruol dittakhai a ko khâwm a, anni chu a lo nghâk zing a."
25,"And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.","Chun, Peter chu a lût ding lai takin Korneli chun a lo tuok a, a ke bulah a bawkkhup a, Pathien chibai bûk angin a bûk a."
26,"But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin ama chu a keitho a, “Ngîr rawh, kei khawm mihriem ka ni hi,” a ta."
27,"And as he talked with him, he went in, and findeth many come together:","Chun, a kâwla thu hril pumin a lût a, mi tamtak umkhâwm chu a va hmuh a."
28,"and he said unto them, Ye yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come unto one of another nation; and yet unto me hath God showed that I should not call any man common or unclean:","An kuomah, “Juda mîn hnam dang kuoma fe le pâwl a thieng nawzie nangnîn in hriet a nih; nisienlakhawm, tukhawm thiengnaw le inthiengnaw ka ti ding an nawh ti Pathienin a mîn hriettir a nih."
29,"wherefore also I came without gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me.","Chuleiin, in mi hung ko phingle khan sêl loin ka hung a ni hi. Chuongchun, kân dawn cheu, ieng am a na in mi hung ko san?” a ta."
30,"And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel,","Chun, Korneli chun, “Ni li a ni tah, tu phâ ang chen hin, ka inah, chawhnung inher ṭawngṭainaah ka ṭawngṭai a; chun, ngai ta, mi pakhat puon vârtak silin ka hmaah a hung ngîr a,"
31,"and saith, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.","‘Korneli, i ṭawngṭaina kha hrietin a um tah, mi kuoma i thilpêkhai khawm kha Pathienin a hriet zing ie."
32,"Send therefore to Joppa, and call unto thee Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side.","Chuleiin, Joppa khuoah mi tir la, Simon Peter an ti chu, i kuomah ko rawh, ama chu tuisuoriet panga savun siemtu Simon ina tlung a nih,’ a ta."
33,"Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee of the Lord.","Chuleiin, i kuomah mi ka hung tir nghâl tah a nih; i hung hi a ṭha ie. Chuongchun, Lalpain thu a pêk taphawt che hre dingin tuhin Pathien mithmuin kan rêngin hitaka hin kan um a ni hi,” a ta."
34,"And Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:",Peter chun a hril a;— “Pathienin mi ditsak bîk a nei nawh ti indiktakin ka hriet;
35,"but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.","nisienlakhawm, hnam tin lai tû- khawm ama ṭia, feltaka thaw taphawt chu, a lâwm zâwng mi a ni hlak."
36,"The word which he sent unto the children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)—","Ama chun thlamuongna Chan- chin Ṭha Isu Krista baua hrilin Israel thlahai kuomah thu ân phur a, (Isu chu mi po po Lal a nih)."
37,"that saying ye yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judæa, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;","Johanin a khêkpui hlak baptisma zoa khan, thu, Galili rama inthawkin hung inthang phutin, Juda ram po poa inthang suok kha, nangnîn in hriet bawk annâwm."
38,"even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.","Nazareth Isu chungchâng thu kha, khânga ama chu Pathienin Thlarau Inthieng le thilthawtheinaa a vurzie kha; ama chun mi chunga thawṭhain le diebol suknawmnat po po sukdamin a fang vêl hlak, Pathien a kuoma a um leiin."
39,"And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree.",Juda ram le Jerusalema a thilthawhai po po hretu kan nih; ama chu thinglêra khaiin an sukhlum tah.
40,"Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,","Pathienin ama chu ni thum niin a keitho nâwk a, fietakin ân entir a,"
41,"not to all the people, but unto witnesses that were chosen before of God, even to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.","amiruokchu, mi po po kuomah ni loin, a thu hretu ni dinga inhmaa Pathienin a ithlang tah, keini, mithi laia a thonâwk hnunga a kuoma faa dâwntuhai kuoma hin a nih."
42,"And he charged us to preach unto the people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.","Ama chu mithihai le mi hringhai chunga Rorêltua Pathien iruot chu a nih ti, mi kuoma khêkpui le inhriettir dingin Pathienin thu a mi pêk a nih."
43,"To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.","“Tûkhawm ama ring taphawt chu a hming leiin suolhai ngaidamin um an tih ti hieng a chanchin hi zâwlneihai po poin an inhriettir hlak kha a nih,” a ta."
44,"While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word.","Chun, Peterin chuong thu chu a hril lai tak chun, thu hretuhai po po chunga chun Thlarau Inthieng a hung tlung tah a."
45,"And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.","Chun, Sertanhai laia ringtuhai Peter hung zuituhai chun Thlarau Inthieng pêk chu Jentailhai chunga khawm buok a ni leiin mak an ti hleh a;"
46,"For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,","ṭawng hrietnawhaia thu hrilin, Pathien inpâkin an hriet sih a."
47,"Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?","Chun, Peterin a biek a, “Hieng mihai, eini anga Thlarau Inthieng hmuhai hi baptisma an chang nawna dingin miin tui hmang an khap thei am a nih?” a ta."
48,And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.,"Chuongchun, Isu Krista hminga baptisma chang ding thu a pêk a. Chuong zoa chun ni iengzat amani lai châm dingin an ngên a."
