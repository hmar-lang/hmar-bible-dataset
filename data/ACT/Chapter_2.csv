1,"And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place.","Chun, Pentikost ni a hung tlungin, an rêngin hmun khatah an um khâwm vawng a."
2,"And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.","Chun, kârloin vâna inthawkin ri thlipui hrâng angin a hung tlung ta phut a. Chu chun an ṭhungna in chu a suksip ta vawng a."
3,"And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them.","Chun, leihai ama le ama insemin, mei angin an kuomah a hung inlâr ta a."
4,"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.","Chun, an chungah a chuong seng a, an rêngin Thlarau Inthiengin an sip ta vawng a, Thlarauin ân ṭawngtir ang peiin ṭawng danghaiin an lo ṭawng tah a."
5,"Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.","Chun, vânkhuphnuoia hnam tin laia mi Pathien ngaisak Judahai Jerusalemah an châm a."
6,"And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language.","Chun, chu ri chu an hriet phingleh mipui an hung inkhâwm a, mi tinin an ṭawng chu mâni ṭawng sengin an lo hriet leiin an lungrilin an lo buoi a."
7,"And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilæans?","Chun, an rêng chun an lunginzîng a, mak an ti hleh a; “En ta u, hieng a ṭawnghai po po hi Galili rama mi an ni naw am a nih?"
8,"And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?",Iengtiziea ei rênga ei ṭawng piengpui anga ei hriet seng am a na?
9,"Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judæa and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,","Ṭhenkhat Parthai hnam dâm, Medai hnam dâm, Elamatai hnam dâm, ei ni sih a; Mesopotamia rama um dâm, Judai rama um dâm, Kappadoki rama um dâm, Ponto rama um dâm, Asia rama um dâm,"
10,"in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,","Phrugia rama um dâm, Pamphulia rama um dâm, Aigupta rama um dâm, Kurini kâwl vêla Libu rama um ei na,"
11,"Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.","ṭhenkhat Rom khaw mikhuol — Judahai le an saphunhai leh-ei na, ṭhenkhat Kret thlierkâra mi le Arab rama mi ei ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, Pathien thilthaw ropuihai an hril mâni ṭawng sengin ei hriet si hi!” an ta."
12,"And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?","Chun, an rêng chun mak an ti hleh a, a ngaina an hriet nawh a, “Hieng hi iengtizie am a na?” an in tih a."
13,"But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.","Ṭhenkhatin an nuisan a, “Uoin thar an inrui a ni hi,” an ta."
14,"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, saying, Ye men of Judæa, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my words.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter chu sâwm le pakhathai leh an ngîr a, ama chun rawl inringtakin, an kuomah a hril a, “Nangni Judai rama mihai, nangni Jerusalema um po pohai, hieng hi hre unla, ka thu khawm lo ngai ro."
15,"For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is but the third hour of the day;","Hienghai hi in ring angin an inrui nawh, vairik chau a la ni hi."
16,but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel:,Hieng hi zâwlnei Joelin a hril kha a ni lem:
17,"And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh: And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, And your young men shall see visions, And your old men shall dream dreams:","Pathienin, ‘Ni nuhnungahai chun hieng hi nîng a ta, Mi po po chungah ka Thlarau buok ka ta; Chuongchun, in naupahai, in naunuhaiin ka thu hril an tih; In tlangvâlhaiin inlârnahai hmûng an ta, In tarhaiin mangah mang an ta;"
18,Yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.,"Anih, chuong nia chun ka suokpahai, ka suoknuhai chunga khawm, Ka Thlarau buok ka ta, ka thu hril an tih,"
19,"And I will show wonders in the heaven above, And signs on the earth beneath; Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:","Chun, chungtieng vânah thilmakhai, Hnuoi tieng leihnuoiah inchiknahai inhmutir ka tih: Thisen dâm, mei dâm, meikhu hu dâm,"
20,"The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come, That great and notable day:","Nisa inthimin inchang a ta, Thla thisenin inchang a ta, Lalpa ni ropuitak le hminginthangtak chu A hung tlung hma chun;"
21,"And it shall be, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.","Chun, hieng hi nîng a ta, Tûkhawm Lalpa hming lam taphawt chu sandaminum an tih,’ a tih, a ti kha."
22,"Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know;","“Nangni Israel mihai hieng thu hi lo ngai ro; Nazareth Isu chu, Pathienin nangni lai thilthaw mak dâm, thilmak dâm, inchikna dâm inthawtirin ân hriet chiengtir cheu kha,"
23,"him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay:","Nangni ngeiin in hriet ang khan; kha mipa kha Pathien rêl tlat le hriet lâwk angin an inmantir a, nangnîn mi suolhai kutin krawsah in hemdeh a, in sukhlum tah a."
24,"whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.","Kha mipa kha Pathienin thina khuopnahai chu a sûtpêk a, a keitho tah a; ama chu thina chel sawng ruol a ni naw leiin."
25,"For David saith concerning him, I beheld the Lord always before my face; For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:","Chun, David chun ama thu chu a hril a, ‘Ka hmaah kumkhuoin Lalpa chu ka hmu hlak, Kân hnîng nawna dingin ka changtieng a um a nih;"
26,"Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope:","Chuleiin, ka lungril a hlim a, Ka lei khawm a lâwm a; Chuleiin, ka tisa khawm beiseitakin um bawk a tih;"
27,"Because thou wilt not leave my soul unto Hades, Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption.","Ka thlarau mithi khuoah mâksan naw ti nih a, I mi inthieng hmawnhmangna hmu khawm phal naw ti nih a;"
28,Thou madest known unto me the ways of life; Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance.,"Nangin hringna lampuihai i mîn hriettir a, Nangin i hmêlin lâwmin mi suksip i tih,’ tiin."
29,"Brethren, I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us unto this day.","“Unauhai, chi thlatu David chanchin hi ṭi loin in kuomah ka hril cheu a; ama chu a thi a; phûm khawm an phûm tah annâwm, a thlân khawm tu chen hin ei kuomah a la um zing a."
30,"Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set one upon his throne;","Ama chu zâwlnei a na, Pathienin a ṭhalbea mi tû amanih a ṭhungpha chungah ân ṭhungtir ding a nih ti inkhâmin a hril ti a hriet a."
31,"he foreseeing this spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.","Chuongchun, chuong chu a lo hriet lâwk zing leiin, Krista thonâwkna ding thu a hril a nih, ‘Mithi khuoah mâksanin a um nawh a, a ruong khawmin hmawnna a hmu bawk nawh,’ tiin."
32,"This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses.","Chu Isu chu Pathienin a keitho nâwk ta hrim a, chu chu kan rêng hin a hretu kan nih."
33,"Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear.","Pathien kut changtienga chawi- mawiin a um a, Thlarau Inthieng tiem chu Pa kuoma inthawkin a hmuh a, in hmu le in hriet hi a hung buok a ni hi."
34,"For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,","David chu vânah a hang lâwn naw a nih, ama ngeiin, ‘Lalpa chun ka Lalpa kuomah, Ka changtieng ṭhung zing rawh,"
35,Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.,"I hmêlmahai i kepha innghatnaa Ka siem hmakhat chu,’ a tih a, a ti lem a ni kha."
36,"Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.","“Chuongchun, Isu in hemde ngei kha, Pathienin Lal le Krista ni fâwmin a siem tah ti, Israel hnam tinin hre mawl raw se,” a ta."
37,"Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?","Chun, chuong thu chu an hrietin an lungrilah sun ang an lo ni tah a, Peter le tirko danghai kuoma chun, “Unauhai, iengtin am thaw tâng kan ta?” an tih a."
38,"And Peter said unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.","Peter chun an kuomah, “In suolhai ngaidamna dingin, sim unla, Isu Krista hmingin baptisma chang seng ro; chuongchun, Thlarau Inthieng pêk hi hmûng in tih."
39,"For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him.","A tiem kha, nangni ta ding khawmin, in nauhai ta ding khawmin, hlataka mi po po ta ding khawmin, Lalpa ei Pathienin a kuoma a kohai taphawt ta dingin a nih ie,” a ta."
40,"And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.","Chun, thu dang tamtakin a hrilfieh a, “Tulai ruolthar rilohaia in- thawk hin insukhim ro,” tiin ân fui a."
41,They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added unto them in that day about three thousand souls.,"Chun, a thu zâwm taphawt chun baptisma an chang tah a; chu nia chun mi sâng thum lai belsain an um a."
42,"And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.","Chun, tirkohai inchûktirin, in- pâwlin, bei khawiin, ṭawngṭaiin ṭhahnemngaitakin an um zing a."
43,And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.,"Chun, mi tinin an ṭi tah a; tirkohai chun thilmak le inchikna tamtak an thawh a."
44,"And all that believed were together, and had all things common;","Chun, a ring taphawt chun iengkim an inṭâwm a,"
45,"and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.","an thil neihai, an thuom- hnawhai an zawr a, an mamaw dai tâwk seng chauin an rênga kuoma chun an sem hlak."
46,"And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,","Ni tin lungril hmunkhatin Pathien biekina chun ṭhahnem- ngaitakin an um hlak a, an in tieng khawm bei an khawi a, hlimtak le lungawitakin bu an fâk hlak a."
47,"praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved.","Pathien an inpâk a, mi po po lâwmzâwngin an um hlak. Chun, sandama hung um pei taphawthai chu, Lalpain ni tin an kuomah ân ṭhangsatir pei hlak."
