1,"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,","Nisienlakhawm, mi pakhat a hming Anania a nuhmei Saphira leh an um a, Anania chun hnuoi a zawr a, a nuhmei hrietin a man a ṭhen a ip tah a."
2,"and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.","Chun, a ṭhen a hung chawi a, tirkohai ke bula chun a sie a."
3,"But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin, “Ana- nia, Thlarau Inthieng hlêm ding le, hnuoi man a ṭhen ip dingin iengdinga Setanin I lungril a suksip am a na?"
4,"While it remained, did it not remain thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.","A um sûng po khan i ta a ni zing a ni naw am a nih? I zawr hnung khawm khan a man chu i thu thua um a ni naw am a nih? Iengdinga hieng thu hi i lungrila i ngaituo am a na? Mihriem hlêm i ni nawh a, Pathien kuoma khêl hril i ni lem,” a ta."
5,And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it.,"Chun, Anania chun chuong thu chu a hriet phingleh a tluh a, a thi tah a; chun, a hre taphawt chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk a."
6,"And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him.","Chun, tlangvâlhai chu an tho a, an tuom a, an zâwn suok a, an phûm tah a."
7,"And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.","Chun, dârkar thum lai hnunga chun, a nuhmei chu thil umzie chu hre loin a hung lût a."
8,"And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yea, for so much.","Chun, Peterin a kuomah, “Mi hril rawh, Hnuoi chu hieng zât char hin maw in zawr?” a ta. Ama chun, “Uou, hieng zât char hin a nih,” a ta."
9,"But Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out.","Chun, Peterin a kuomah, “Ieng- dinga Lalpa Thlarau infiena dinga in inthuruol am? Ngai ta, i pasal phûmtuhai kepha chu kawtkhâr bulah a hung um tah, nang khawm zâwn dawk an ti che,” a ta."
10,"And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.","Chun, kârloin a ke bula chun a tlu nghâl tah a, a thi ve tah a; chun, tlangvâlhai chu an hung lût a, ama chu a thisain an hung hmuh a, an zâwn dawk a, a pasal kâwla chun an phûm tah a."
11,"And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.","Chun, kohranhai po po le chuong thu hre taphawt chun an ṭi ta bêk bêk a."
12,And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people: and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.,"Chun, mi lai Pathienin tirkohai kutin inchikna le thilmak tamtak a thaw hlak. Annirawi chu an rêngin lungril hmunkhatin Solomon Tuol- pûka chun an inkhâwm hlak."
13,But of the rest durst no man join himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them;,"Mi dang ruok chu tukhawm anni lai an ṭhang ve ngam ta nawh; nisienlakhawm, anni chu miin an inpâk hlak."
14,"and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women:","Chun, a ring tharhai nuhmei le pasal tamtakin Lalpa kuoma chun an hung belsa nâwk zuol hlak a."
15,"insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them.","Chuongchun, mi damnawhai khawm kawtthlêrhaiah an zâwn dawk a, khumahai, puonphaahai an inzâltir a, “Peter fe malamin a hlimin a ṭhen bêk a hlie theina dingin,” an ta."
16,"And there also came together the multitude from the cities round about Jerusalem, bringing sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.","Chun, Jerusalem kâwl vêl khuoa inthawkin mipuihai khawm chu damnawhai, khawhri inthieng- naw isawisakhai hung ṭhuoiin an hung khâwm a; chuonghai khawm chu an hung dam ta seng a."
17,"But the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,","Chun, thiempu Laltak le a ruolhai po po an hung inthawk a, (chuong a ruolhai chu Saddukai pâwl an nih,) an îtthîk bêk bêk a,"
18,"and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward.","tirkohai chu an man a, vântlâng intângna inah an khum tah a."
19,"But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said,","Nisienlakhawm, Lalpa vântirko pakhatin, kawtkhârhai chu a hung hawng a, a ṭhuoi suok tah a,"
20,"Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life.","“Pathien biekinah va ngîr unla, mi kuomah hieng hringna thu po po hi va hril ro,” a ta."
21,"And when they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought.","Chun, chu thu chu an hrietin khawvar hun vêla chun Pathien biekinah an va lût a, an inchûktir a. Nisienlakhawm, Thiempu Laltak le a ruolhai chu an hung a, rorêltuhai le Israel thlahai upahai po po an ko khâwm a, tirkohai chu hung inṭhuoitir dingin intângna ina chun mi an tir a."
22,"But the officers that came found them not in the prison; and they returned, and told,","Nisienlakhawm, manmihai chu an va tlung chun intângna ina chun anni chu an hmu si nawh; chuong- chun, an kîr nâwk a,"
23,"saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.","“Intângna in chu himtaka inkhârin, a vêngtuhai khawm kawt- khâr bula ngîrin kan hmu sih a; nisienlakhawm, kan hei hawng a, a sûngah tukhawm kan hmu si nawh,” tiin an hril a."
24,"Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow.","Chun, Pathien biekin hotu le thiempu lalhaiin chuong thu chu an hrietin, “Hieng hi iengtin tak inphuong a ti maw?” tiin an thua chun an lunginzîng ta bêk bêk a."
25,"And there came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people.","Chun, mi pakhat a hung a, an kuomah, “Ngai ta u, intângna ina mi inkhumhai khan Pathien biekinah ngîrin mi an inchûktir ka ti!” tiin an hung hril a."
26,"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them, but without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.","Chuongchun, hotu chu manmi- hai le chun an va feh a, vântlâng an ṭi leiin tlangtakin an hung ṭhuoi a, chuong naw chun lunga dêng an ṭih a."
27,"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,","Chun, an hung ṭhuoi tlung chun rorêltuhai hmaa chun an inngîrtir a. Chun, Thiempu Laltak chun an kuomah,"
28,"saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.","“Hi hming hin inchûktir lo ding kan ti tlat ta cheu kha; hre ro, in thu inchûktirin Jerusalem in suksip vawng ta hi; chu mipa sukhlum bul chu mîn tumtir in tum a ni hi,” tiin a suosal a."
29,"But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter le tirko- hai chun, “Mihriem thu nêkin Pathien thu kan zâwm lem ding a nih."
30,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.","Nangnîn Isu thinga khaikângin in sukhlum kha, ei thlatuhai Pathienin a keitho nâwk tah a nih."
31,"Him did God exalt with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.","Ama ngei kha Pathienin Lal le Sandamtua um dingin a changtieng a chawimawi tah, Israelhai suol insim- tir ding le ngaidam dingin."
32,"And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.","Chuong thu chu, a hretuhai kan ni hi, Thlarau Inthieng, Pathienin a thu zâwm taphawthai kuoma a pêk kha, a hretu a ni ve bawk a,” an ta, an dawn a."
33,"But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and were minded to slay them.","Chun, anni chun chuong thu chu an hrietin an lungril a khei tah a, sukhlum an tum tah a."
34,"But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while.","Nisienlakhawm, rorêltuhai lai chun, a hming Gamaliel, Pharisai, Dân hretu, mi po po laia hminginthangtak, mi pakhat chu a ngîr a, chuhai chu insuoktir phawt dingin thu a pêk a."
35,"And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do.","Chun, rorêltuhai kuoma chun, “Nangni Israel mihai, hihai chunga in thil thaw tum hi fîmkhur ro."
36,"For before these days rose up Theudas, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nought.","Tuta hma khawm khan, Theo- da, ‘Mi lien ka nih,’ tiin a hung um a, chu mipa kuoma chun mi tamtak, za li lai an lo kawp a. Ama chu sukhlumin a um tah a; a thu zâwm taphawt chu an rêngin an indar ta vawng a, iengkhawm an ni ta nawh."
37,"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the enrolment, and drew away some of the people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.","Chu mipa um hnung chun, hming ziek lai khan Galili rama mi Juda kha a hung um nâwk a, a kuomah mi ṭhenkhat a hîp nâwk a, nisienlakhawm, ama chu a thi tah a, a thu zâwm taphawt chu an rêngin an indar ta vawng a."
38,"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown:","Chuleiin, tuhin ka ti cheu hi, hieng mihai hi tâwk naw unla, um el raw hai se; hieng an thil thaw tum le an thilthaw hi mihriem ithaw suok el a ni chun bohmang a tih;"
39,"but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God.","amiruokchu, Pathien ithaw suok a ni chun anni sukbohmang thei naw ti niu; chuong naw chun, Pathien do ni hlau rawi in tih,” a ta. Chun, a hril chu rem an ti tah a."
40,"And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.","Chuongchun, tirkohai chu an ko a, an vuok a, chu zo chun Isu hminga thu hril lo ding ti tlatin an insuo tah a."
41,"They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.","Chuongchun, rorêltuhai laia inthawk chun an suok a, chu hming leia muolphona tuor tlâka ruot an ni leiin an lâwm hleh a."
42,"And every day, in the temple and at home, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus as the Christ.","Chun, ni tin Pathien biekina le anni inahai, “Isu chu Krista a nih,” tiin inchûktir le hril an ma nawh."
