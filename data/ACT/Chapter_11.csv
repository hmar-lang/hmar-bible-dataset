1,Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judæa heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.,"Chun, Juda rama tirko le unau umhai chun Jentailhai khawmin Pathien thu an zâwm ti an hriet tah a."
2,"And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,","Chuongchun, Peter chu Jeru- salem a hang tlung phingleh, Sertanhaiin an kal a,"
3,"saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.","a kuomah, “Sertan nawhai inah i lût a, an kuomah i fâk vei a,” an ta."
4,"But Peter began, and expounded the matter unto them in order, saying,","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin a bula inthawkin indawt zatin an kuomah a hrilfieh a;"
5,"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me:","“Joppa khuoah ṭawngṭaia ka um laiin zêlin ka um a. Mang angin iengkhat bâwm, puon lientak ang, a ki palia khita, vâna inthawka inkhaithla ka hmuh a; ka kâwla ngei a mi hung hnai a."
6,"upon which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven.","Chu chu ka en zing a, ka ngai- tuoh a, hnuoia mi sapheimanlihai, ramsahai, thilhringhai le chunga vatehai ka hmuh a."
7,"And I heard also a voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.","Chun, rawlin, ‘Peter, tho rawh, that la fa rawh,’ mi tiin ka hriet bawk a."
8,"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.","Nisienlakhawm, keiin, ‘Lalpa, ni lo e, thiengnaw le inthiengnaw ieng- khawm ka bauah a lût ngai nawh,’ ka ta."
9,"But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.","Nisienlakhawm, vâna inthawka rawl chun a vawi hninaah, ‘Pathienin a sukthieng ta chu nangin inthieng- naw ti naw,’ tiin a mi dawn a."
10,And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven.,"Chuong ang ruok chun vawi thum a hung um a; chun, iengkim chu vâna zuk khaiin a um nâwk tah a."
11,"And behold, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Cæsarea unto me.","Chun, ngai ta u, mi pathum, Kaisari khuoa inthawkin ka kuomah an hung tir a, ka umna tuola chun an lo um zing tah a."
12,"And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we entered into the man’s house:","“Chun, Thlarauin lunghimaw- na nei loa anni zui dingin a mi tir a. Hieng unau parukhai khawm hin an mi zui veh a, mi ina chun kan lût a."
13,"and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;","Chun, ama chun kan kuomah, a ina vântirko ngîr a hmuzie le, vântirko chun a kuomah, ‘Joppa khuoah mi tir la, Simon, Peter an ti chu, hung inṭhuoitir rawh;"
14,"who shall speak unto thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.","ama chun thu hril a ti cheh a, ama thu lei chun nang le i sûnghai sandamin um in tih,’ a tizie khawm a mi hril a."
15,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.","Chun, thu ka hang hril hlimin Thlarau Inthieng ei chunga a hung tlung tir lai ang khan an chungah a hung tlung tah a."
16,"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.","Chun, Lalpa thu, ‘Johanin tuiin mi a baptis hlak kha, nangni ruok chu Thlarau Inthiengin baptisma la chang in tih,’ a tizie kha ka hung hriet suok nâwk tah a."
17,"If then God gave unto them the like gift as he did also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?","Chuongchun, Lalpa Isu Krista an ring phingleh, Pathienin thil thlâwnpêk a mi pêk ang kha an kuoma a pêk phawt tahnung chu, kei tê hi Pathien sêl ruol am ka nih?” a ta."
18,"And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life.","Chuong thu chu an hrietin an to tah a, “Chuong a ni chun, Pathienin Jentailhai khawm hring dingin sim a phal tah a ni chu,” tiin Pathien an inpâk tah a."
19,"They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews.","Chun, Stephan leia an suk- nawmnata indarhai kha, Phoiniki ram dâm, Kupra thlierkâr dâm, Antiokei dâm chenin an feh a, Juda- hai kuoma chau naw chu tu kuoma khawm thu an hril nawh a."
20,"But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.","Nisienlakhawm, anni laia a ṭhen chu Kupra thlierkâr le Kurinia mihai an na, chuonghai chu Antiokei an tlung chun Grikhai kuoma khawm, Lalpa Isu Chanchin Ṭha an hril ve tah a."
21,And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord.,"Chun, Lalpa kutin anni a ṭhangpui a; mi tamtakin an ring a, Lalpa tieng chu an ngha tâwl tah a."
22,And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as far as Antioch:,"chun, an chanchin chu Jerusalema kohran umhai naa chun a hung lût tah a; chuongchun, Antiokei chen chun Barnaba chu an tir suok tah a."
23,"who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord:","Chun, ama chu a va tlung a, Pathien lunginsietzie chu a hmu chun a lâwm hleh a; ṭhahnemngai- taka Lalpa chel zing dingin an rêngin ân fui tah a."
24,"for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.","Barnaba chu mi ṭhatak, Thlarau Inthieng le ringnaa sip a nih. Chun, mi tamtakin Lalpa kuomah an belsa tah a."
25,And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul;,"Chun, Barnaba chu Saula zawng dingin Tarsa khuoah a feh a; chun a hmu chun Antiokeia chun a hung ṭhuoi a."
26,"and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught much people; and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.","Chun, kum khat zet kohranhai inkhâwmnaa chun an ṭhang ve hlak a, mi tamtak an inchûktir hlak a. Antiokeia chun a nih inchûktirhai chu “Kristien” an ti hmasa tak chu."
27,Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.,"Chun, chuong lai chun zâwlnei tuhai amanih Jerusalema inthawkin Antiokeia chun an zu feh a."
28,"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.","Chun, anni laia mi pakhat, a hming Agaba, a ngîr a, khawvêl po poah ṭâm nasatak a tlung ding a ni ti Thlalrau hrilin ân hriettir a; chu ṭâm chu Klaudi inlal laiin a hung tlung tah a."
29,"And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judæa:","Chuongchun, inchûktirhai chun, an thei tâwk sengin, Judai rama unau umhai kuoma chun sawmdâwlna ding thawn an tum a."
30,"which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.","Chu chu an thaw ta ngei a, Barnaba le Saula kuta chun upahai kuomah an inphur tah a."
