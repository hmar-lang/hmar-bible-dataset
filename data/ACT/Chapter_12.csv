1,Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.,"Chun, chuong lai vêl chun Lal Herod chun kohrana mi ṭhenkhat suknawmnat tumin a kut ân let tah a."
2,And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.,"Jakob, Johan unau chu, kâwl- hnâmin a sâthlum a."
3,"And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And those were the days of unleavened bread.","Chu chun Judahai chu a suklâwm ti a hrietin, Peter khawm chu man a tum nâwk pei a. (Chuong nihai chu Chawlṭhanglo Bei ruoiṭhe ni a nih)."
4,"And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.","chun, a man hnung chun intângna inah a khum a, sipai pâwl li, pali seng peiin, ân vêng sâwktir a; Fekân Ruoiṭhe zoa mi po po kuoma ṭhuoi suok a tum a na."
5,Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him.,"Chuleiin, Peter chu intângna inah ân umtir hrih a; nisienlakhawm, kohranhaiin ama ta dingin ṭha- hnemngaitakin Pathien kuomah an ṭawngṭaipêk hlak a."
6,"And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison.","Chun, Herod chun a ṭhuoi suok tâwmin, chu zân tak chun Peter chu sipai pahni inkârah khaidiet pahni bunin a in a, a vêngtuhai khawm kawtkhâr bulah an um a, intângna in chu an vêng a."
7,"And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.","Chun, ngai ta, Lalpa vântirko pakhat a kâwlah a hung ngîr a, rip sûnga chun var ieng amanih a hung var a, Peter nâkah a khîk har a, “Tho vak rawh,” a ta. Chun, a khaidiethai chu a kuta chu a tla tah a."
8,"And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.","Vântirko chun a kuomah, “Dier kei la, i kekawk bun rawh,” a ta. Ama chun chuong ang chun a thawh a. Chun vântirko chun a kuomah, “I puon bât ṭha la, mi zui rawh,” a ta."
9,"And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.","Peter chu a suok a, a zui tah a; vântirko chângzie chu a tak a ni ti a hriet nawh a, manga a hmu amanih a sâwn lem a."
10,"And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him.","Chun, vêngtu hmasa le a dawttu chu an khêl hnung chun, tuol suokna ding thîr kawtkhâr chu an va tlung a, chu chu an ta dingin ân hawng fâwm tah a; an suok a, kawtthlêr pakhat an khêl a; chun, vântirko chun a fe san nghâl tah a."
11,"And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.","Chun, Peter chu a har phingleh, “Lalpain a vântirko a tir suok a, Herod kut le Juda mihai beiseina po poa inthawkin a mi sandam ti tuhin indiktakin ka hriet tah,” a ta."
12,"And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying.","Chun, ân ngaituo zo chun, Johan, Marka an ti, chu mipa nu Mari ina chun a va feh a; chutaka chun ṭawngṭaiin mi tamtak an lo um khâwm a."
13,"And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda.","Chun, tuolpûk kawtkhâr a hei nawk phingleh, a hming Rodi, nunghâk pakhat, dawn dingin a va feh a."
14,"And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.","Peter rawl a hriet phingleh, a lâwm leiin kawt chu hawng loin a tlân lût nâwk ta lem a, “Peter chu kawtkhâr bulah a ngîr” tiin a va hril a."
15,"And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel.","Nisienlakhawm, anni chun a kuomah, “în vêt a ni ta hi,” an lo tih a. Ama ruok chu, “Titakzet a nih,” tiin a ṭhang ṭal a. Anni chun, “A vântirko a ni chu,” an ta."
16,"But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.","Nisienlakhawm, Peter chun a nawk zing a; chun, an hei hawng chun, ama chu an hmuh a, mak an ti hleh a."
17,"But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place.","Chuongchun, ama chun an tona dingin kutin a zâp a, Pathienin intângna ina inthawka a ṭhuoi suokzie chu a hril tah a. Chun, “Hieng thu hi Jakob le unauhai kuomah va hril ro,” a ta. Chun, a suok a, ram dangah a fe tah a."
18,"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.","Chun, nisa a suok phingleh, sipaihai chu, “Peter khâwlai am a um tah a?” tiin buoi namênin an buoi nawh a."
19,"And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judæa to Cæsarea, and tarried there.","Herod chun a zawng a, a hmu si nawh a, a vêngtuhai chu a suosal a, sukhlum dingin thu a pêk tah a. Chun, Herod chu Judai rama inthawkin Kaisari khuoah a zu feh a, chutaka chun a um zing a."
20,"Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king’s country.","Herod chu, Tura le Sidon khuoa mihai chunga chun a lungninaw bêk bêk a. Anni chun, Blasta, lal khum vêngtu chu, an ruolah an siem a, inthuruolin a kuomah an hung a, an khuo tiengin lal khuo tienga pûr inchaw hlak an ni leiin inrem an ngên a."
21,"And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration unto them.","A ni tiem ni chun, Herod chun lal puon a sil a, lalṭhungphaah a ṭhung a, an kuomah thu a hril a."
22,"And the people shouted, saying, The voice of a god, and not of a man.","Mi po po chun, “Pathien rawl a ni hi, mihriem rawl a ni naw hi,” an ta, an khêk a."
23,"And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.","Ama chun Pathien kuomah chawimawina chu a pêk naw leiin Lalpa vântirkoin kârloah a man a, rulrukûtin a fâk a, a thi tah a."
24,But the word of God grew and multiplied.,"Pathien thu ruok chu, ân dâr a, a pung ta pei a."
25,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministration, taking with them John whose surname was Mark.","Chun, Barnaba le Saula chun, rawng chu an bâwl zo chun, Jerusalema inthawk chun an kîr nâwk tah a, Johan, Marka an ti chu an kuomah an ṭhuoi veh a."
