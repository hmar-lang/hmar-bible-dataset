1,"And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.","Chun, nasêtum chu a re zo chun, Paulain inchûktirhai ân kotir a, ân fui a, ṭawng bauṭhain a ṭheh a, Makedonia rama fe dingin a suok tah a."
2,"And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.","Chun, thu tamtaka inchûktirhai infui peiin chu ram chu a fang suok a, Grik ram a tlung tah a."
3,"And when he had spent three months there, and a plot was laid against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.","Chun, chutaka chun thla thum a thang hnungin Suria ram tieng lawngin a fe ding a na, Judahaiin ama an phierrûk leiin Makedonia rama fe nghâl a tum nâwk lem tah a."
4,"And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.","Chun, Purrha naupa Sopater Beroia khuoa mi hai, Thessalonikaa mi Aristarka le Sekunda hai, Derbea mi Gaia hai, Timothe hai, Asia ram mi Tukik le Trophim hai, ama leh Asia rama chun an va fe veh a."
5,"But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.","Chuonghai chun kan hma an ṭhuoi a, Troasa chun an mi lo nghâk zing a."
6,"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we tarried seven days.","Keini ruok chu Chawlṭhanglo Bei ruoiṭhe ni po po hnunga chun Philippia inthawk chu lawngin kan suok a, ni nga chenah Troasah an kuom kan tlung a; chutaka chun ni sari kan châm a."
7,"And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight.","Chun, ni saria ni hmasataka chun, bei khawi dinga kan um khâwm laiin, Paulain a zînga fe a tum leiin ṭhahnemngaitakin thu a hril a; zân ril chenin thu a hril pei a."
8,And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.,"Chun, pindan chunghnung kan um khâwmnaa chun khâwnvar tamtak a um a."
9,"And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.","Chun, a hming Eutuk, tlangvâl pakhat tukvera chun a ṭhung a, a lo inlusu a lo inlusuh a. Paula thuhril chu a sâwt ta leiin a îmu suok chu a tuor ta nawh a, in sâwng thumnaa inthawk chun a tla tah a, a thiin an lâk tah a."
10,"And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula a ṭum a, a zu bawh a, a zu pawm a, “Thla- phâng naw ro, a hnuk a la chat nawh,” a ta."
11,"And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.","Chun, Paula a hang lâwn nâwk a, bei chu a khawi a, bu a fâk a, sâwttak, khawvar rakin an kuomah thukhawchâng a hril a, chu hnunga chun a fe tah a."
12,"And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.","Chun, tleirawl chu damin an ṭhuoi a, thlamuong namênin an thlamuong ta nawh a."
13,"But we, going before to the ship, set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.","Chun, keini ruok chu lawngah kan lo fe tah a, Asso pan dingin lawng chun kan suok hmasa a, chutaka chun Paula chu inchuongtir kan tum a; ama chun kea hung a tum leiin chuong ang chun amain a ruot hrim a nih."
14,"And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.","Chun, Assoah a mi hung pâwl nâwk chun kan inchuongtir tah a, Mitulin kan tlung a."
15,"And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.","Chutaka inthawk chun lawngin kan fe nâwk a, a zînga chun Kia thlierkâr zâwn kan tlung a; a zing nâwk Sami thlierkâr kan sir a; chu zîng nâwk chun Mileti kan tlung nâwk a."
16,"For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.","Chun, Paulain Asia rama um sâwt a nuom naw leiin, Ephesi chu lawnga khêl a tum sa hrim a na, a thei chun Jerusalemah Penti- kost ni nang a tum a, a fe inhmaw a nih,"
17,"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.","Chun, Miletia inthawkin Ephe- siah mi a tir a, kohrana upahai a kuomah ân kotir a."
18,"And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time,","Chun, a kuoma an hung tlung chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Asia ram ka sir hlima inthawk tah, in kuoma ka um sûng po khan ka um dân kha in hriet a."
19,"serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews;","Judahaiin an mi phierrûk leia mitthli tla le, thil rinum ka chunga tlahai tuor pumin thuhnuoirawltakin Lalpa rawng ka bâwl hlak kha."
20,"how I shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house,","Khâng khan a sâwt ding thil chu in kuomah iengkhawm hril intîm ka nei nawh a, vantlâng lai dâm inchûktir ka ma naw kha."
21,"testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.","Judahai le Grikhai kuoma khawm Pathien tienga lungril inlet thu le, ei Lalpa Isu Krista tieng ringna ding thu kân hriettir hlak kha."
22,"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:","Chun, hre ro, tuhin lungrila fe lo thei loa kân hriet leiin, Jerusalemah ka fe ding a ni hi, chutaka chun ka chunga thil hung tlung ding chin ka hriet nawh."
23,"save that the Holy Spirit testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.","Thlarau Inthiengin ‘Khuopna le rinumnain a tuok che’, tiin khaw tinah a mîn hriettir hlak, chu chau chu ka hriet a nih."
24,"But I hold not my life of any account as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.","Nisienlakhawm, kân tlânsiekna lam ka hmabâk suo ding le, Pathien lunginsietzie Chanchin Ṭha in- hriettir ding, Lalpa Isua inthawka kha rawngbâwl sin ka hmu kha, thaw zo phawt lang chu, ka hringna khawm thlâkhlâ tlâkah ka ruot nawh."
25,"And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more.","“Chun, hre ro, nangni po po, Pathien ram thu khêkpuia kân vâk kân vâkna hlakhai hin ka hmêl hmu nâwk ta naw ti niu ti ka hriet a."
26,"Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.","Chuleiin, mi po po thisenah ka hul a nih ti vawisûn hin kân hriettir cheu."
27,For I shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God.,Pathien rêl po po arêngin in kuoma hril kân tîm nawh a.
28,"Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood.","Pathien kohran ama thisena a inchâwk chu, châwm dingin, nangni le inrawihai po po chunga chun fimkhur ro, Thlarau Inthiengin an chunga hotuin a siem cheu hi."
29,"I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock;","Ka fe hnungin satene hrânghai nangni lai hung lût an ta, pâwlruol chu hla naw ni hai ti ka hriet."
30,"and from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.","Nangni laia mi khawm, inchûktirhai an kuoma inkawptir dingin thu hran hril la hung um an tih."
31,"Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears.","Chuleiin, ngaiven ro; kum thum rau, mitthli tla pumin asûn azâna, mi tin hal ka ma naw kha hre zing ro."
32,"And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you the inheritance among all them that are sanctified.","“Tuhin Pathien le a lunginsiet- na thu kuomah kân kawltir cheu, chu chun a siem lien thei cheu a, mi inthienghai lai ro chan ân neitir thei bawk cheu a."
33,"I coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.","Tu tangkahai, rângkachakhai, silfênhai khawm kân hnar ngai naw kha."
34,"Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.",Hi kuthai hin kei le ka ruolhai pawimaw chu a them suok hlak kha nangni ngeiin in hriet a.
35,"In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.","Iengkim ka thaw taphawt ka thawhmu hlak cheu kha, chuonga sininrim pum le, Lalpa Isu thu hre zing pumin mi hrâtnawhai in ṭhang- pui ding a nih; ama ngeiin, ‘Iengkhat lâk nêkin pêkin lukhâwng a nei lem’, a ti kha,” a ta."
36,"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.","Chun, chuong ang thu chu a hril zo chun, a dingṭhaṭhuon a, an rêngin a ṭawngṭaipui a."
37,"And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him,","Chun, an rêng chun an ṭap a, Paula chu an kuoh a, an fâwp an fâwp a."
38,"sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought him on his way unto the ship.","A hmêl an hmu nâwk naw ding thu a hril chu an lungngaina tak a nih. Chun, lawng chen chun ama an inthla tah a."
