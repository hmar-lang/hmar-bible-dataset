1,"And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.","Chun, Itali rama lawnga kan fe ding an sukthlûk phingleh, Paula le mi intâng dang tuhai amanih,"
2,"And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.","Augusta pâwla mi sipai za hotu Julia an inkawltir a. Adramuttium khaw lawng Asia ram tuisuoriet panga khaw umhai sir dingah kan chuong a, tuisuorietah kan fe tah a; Makedonia rama mi Aristarka, Thessalonikaa mi kan kuomah a um a."
3,"And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself.","A zîngah Sidon khuo kan sîr a, chun, Julia chun Paula a sukṭha hleh a, insukhar dingin a ruolhai kuomah ân lêng tir a."
4,"And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.","Chun, chutaka inthawkin, tuisuo- rietah kan fe nâwk a, thliin a ni naw tieng a mi nam leiin Kupra thlierkâr phên thli inupna tieng kan zâm a."
5,"And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.","Chun, Kilikia ram le Pamphulia ram dep tuisuoriet kan khêl hnungin, Lukia rama Mura khuo kan tlung a."
6,And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein.,"Chutaka chun sipai za hotu chun, Alexandria khaw lawng, Itali ram sir ding chu a hmuh a: chutaka chun a mîn chuongtir a."
7,"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;","Ni sâwt tak damtê têin kan feh a, Knidos khaw zâwn intak takin kan tlung hrâm a, thliin a mi dangkîr leiin Salmoni hrûlah Kret thlierkâr phên thli inupna tieng kan zâm a;"
8,and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.,"chun intak takin vapang kan hrût kan hrût a, likilkawi, Mawi an ti chu kan tlung tah a; chu kâwla chun Lasai khuo a um."
9,"And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,","chun, ni tamtak ân hmang ta lei le, lawnga fe ṭi a um ta leiin, (Bu nghei ni chu a lo khêl ta sih a), Paula chun anni chu ân fui a,"
10,"and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.","an kuomah, “Puhai, tuta lawnga fe hi sietna le bohmangna nasatak a tlung ding a nih ti ka hriet, thuomhnaw le lawng chunga chau ka ti nawh a; eini chunga khawm ka ti a nih,” a ta."
11,"But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.","Nisienlakhawm, sipai za hotu chun, Paula thu hril nêk chun lawngpu le lawng neitu thu hril a awi lem a."
12,"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there; which is a haven of Crete, looking north-east and south-east.","Chun, thlasik tuorna dingin likilkawi chu a rem naw leiin, a tam lemin chutaka inthawka tuisuorieta fe suoka, Phoiniki tlung hrâma, chutaka thlasik tuor an rawtpui a; Phoiniki chu Kret thlierkâra likil- kawi pakhat a nih, hmâr sak le sim sak sawng a nih."
13,"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.","Chun, sim thli chu damtê tea a hung hrâng phingle chun, an ditzâwng an hmu amanih an sâwn a, thîrchakai chu an khaisuok a, Kret thlierkâr pang chu an hrût an hrût a."
14,"But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:","Nisienlakhawm, sâwt nawtê hnunga chun khawmuol tienga chun thli natak a hung hrâng thla tah a, chu thli chu Eurokuilo an ti hlak."
15,"and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven.","Chun, lawng chu a hung nam fûk a, thli tieng ân nghat thei naw phingleh kan inthla tah a, a mi lên a mi lên el tah a."
16,"And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:","A hming Klauda thlierkâr chîtê phên thli inupna tieng chun kan zâm a, intak takin lawnglêng kan hum thei hrâm a."
17,"and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.","Chun, an keisuok hnungin ṭhangpuina hrui dâm an hmang a, lawng hnuoitieng an lâk vêt a, an khuop a. Puon zarna iengkim an sukthlûk a, chuong naw chun Surtia inlên lût an ṭih a, chuongchun, a mi lên a mi lên tah a."
18,"And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the freight overboard;","Chun, a zîngah tuifâwnin a mi vawr hrep lei chun, lawng thuom- hnaw chu tuiah an pei ṭan tah a."
19,and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.,A zîng nâwk chun anni kut ngeiin lawng thuomhnaw an pei suok nâwk tah a.
20,"And when neither sun nor stars shone upon us for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.","Chun, ni sâwttak nisa khawm, arasi khawm ân lang nawh a, thlipui namênin a mi nuoi nawh a, dam hrim kan inbeisei ta nawh a."
21,"And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.","Chun, bu fa loa sâwttak an um hnungin, Paula anni laiah a ngîr a; “Puhai, Kret thlierkâra khan sût loin, ka thu kha awi unla, hieng sietna le bohmangna hi in tlung naw ding bah."
22,"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.","Nisienlakhawm, tukhawm hin lungmuongtaka um dingin kân fui cheu, nangni lai tukhawmin in hringna inhmang naw ti niu, lawng ruok hi chu ân hmang ding a ni hi."
23,"For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,","A ta ka na, a rawng ka bâwl hlak Pathien kha, ama vântirko pakhat vawizân hin ka kâwlah a hung ngîr a, ka kuomah,"
24,"saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Cæsar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee.","‘Paula, ṭi naw, Kaisar hmaah i ngîr ding a nih; chun, ngai rawh, lawnga i kuoma fehai po po khawm hi Pathienin a pêk che a nih,’ a mi ti a nih."
25,"Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me.","Chuleiin, Puhai, lungmuong- takin um ro; Pathien ka ring a, a mi hril ang peiin a um ding a nih."
26,But we must be cast upon a certain island.,"Chuleiin, thlierkâr ienga manih a mi lên suok ding a nih,” a ta."
27,"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:","Chun, Adria tuisuorietah thliin khing tieng khing tieng a mi lên a mi lên a, zân sâwm le pali a tling zân chun, zân ril vêlah lawng mihai chun khâwlai khawmuol amanih tlung dingin an inhriet a."
28,"and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.","Chuongchun, tui inthûkzie an inkhih a, hlam sâwmhni niin an hriet a; chun, sâwt nawtêah an inkhi nâwk a, hlam sâwm le panga niin an hriet a."
29,"And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.","Chun, lawng mei tieng thîr- chakai pali an thlâk a, chuong naw chun lungkho lai mi lên suok hlau rawi a tih, an tih a; chun, khuo var kâr an nghâkhla hle a."
30,"And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,","Chun, lawng mihai chun lawng lu tieng chun thîrchakaihai thlâk ding anga thaw tehlêmin, lawnglêng chu tuisuorietah an thlâk a, lawng chu tlân san an tum a."
31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.","Chu lai chun Paulain sipai za hotu le sipaihai kuoma chun, “Hienghai hi lawngah an um zing naw chun him thei naw ti niu,” a ta."
32,"Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.","Chuongchun, sipaihai chun lawnglêng hruihai chu an ât tan a, an inthla tah a."
33,"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.","Chun, khawvar tâwm chun Paulain mi po po chu bu fa dingin a tir a, “Vawisûn hi ni sâwmpali a ni tah, iengkhawm fa loin in nghâk a, in nghei zing a nih."
34,Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.,"Chuleiin, bu fa dingin ka tir cheu hi; in damna ding a ni hi; nangni laia tukhawm a samzai pakhat khawm bohmang naw ni,” a ta."
35,"And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.","Chun, chu thu chu a hril zoin bei a lâk a, mi po po hmaa chun Pathien kuomah lâwmthu a hril tah a; chun, a khawi a, a fâk phut tah a."
36,"Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.","Anni khawm thlamuongtakin an um a, bu an fâk ve tah a."
37,And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.,Lawnga mi chu kan rêngin za hni sâwmsari paruk kan nih.
38,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.","Chun, an fâk khawp chun bu chu tuisuorietah an pei a, lawng an sukzâng deu a."
39,"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.","Chun, nisa a suok chun, khawmuol chu khâwlai am a ni an hriet nawh a; nisienlakhawm, khâwlai likilkawi amanih ṭieupho an hmuh a, chu chunga chun a thei chun lawng chu intlan suoktir an tum a."
40,"And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.","Thîrchakai thlungnahai chu an ât tan a, tuisuorietah an mâksan a; chu ruol chun a karherna khuop- nahai chu an sût a, hma tieng puon zar chu thli imût ding zawngin an khai sâng a; ṭieupho chu an pan tah a."
41,"But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.","Nisienlakhawm, tuihrât pahni intuokna hmunah kan lût hlau a, lawng chu hnuoi an insuktir tah a. Chuongchun, lawng lu tieng chu ân tâng tlat a, sukchâng ruol loin a um zing a, a mawngtieng ruok chu tuifâwn a nasat leiin a kawi ṭan tah a."
42,"And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.","Chun, sipaihaiin intânghai chu sukhlum an rawt a, chuong naw chun, tui inhlieu kai dâm um an ta, tlân hmang an tih ti an ṭih a."
43,"But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;","Nisienlakhawm, sipai za hotu chun Paula sanhim a nuom a, an thil tum chu a khap a. Tui inhlieu thei po tuisuorieta chun inchâwm thlâk a, khawmuol lo kai hmasa ding le,"
44,"and the rest, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.","mi danghai chu, a ṭhen thingphêk chunghaiah, a ṭhen lawng thuomhnaw dang chunghaiah kai dingin thu a pêk a. Chuong ang chun an rêngin khawmuolah himtakin an kai seng tah a."
