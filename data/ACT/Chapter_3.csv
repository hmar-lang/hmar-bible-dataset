1,"Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.","Chun, Peter le Johan chu chawhnung inher, ṭawngṭai hun lai chun, Pathien biekina lût ding chun an hang feh a."
2,"And a certain man that was lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;","Chun, patling tu amanih a pieng tira inthawka ke inbai an hung zâwn a, ama chu biekina lûthai kuoma kut daw dingin, biekin kawtkhâr, “Maawi,” an ti bula chun, ni tin an inzâltir hlak a."
3,"who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.","Ama chun Peter le Johan Pathien biekina lût ding chu a hmuh a, kut a dawh a."
4,"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us.","Chun, Peter le Johanin ama chu an en zing a. Peterin, “Keini mi hang en ta,” a ta."
5,"And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them.","Ama chun an kuoma inthawka ieng amanih hmu a beisei a, a hang en a."
6,"But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.","Nisienlakhawm, Peterin, “Tang- ka le rângkachak iengkhawm ka nei nawh; nisienlakhawm, ka nei sun pêng ka ti che; Nazareth Isu Krista hmingin kein lâwn ta rawh,” a ta."
7,"And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength.","A kut changtieng a chel a, a keitho tah a. Chun, kârloin a kehai le a kemit ruhai chu a hung hrât nghâl tah a."
8,"And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.","Chun, ama chu ân châwm tho a, a ngîr a, a kein a lâwn phut tah a. Kea lâwn lâwn le, inchâwm le, Pathien inpâk pum peiin biekina chun a lût ve tah a."
9,And all the people saw him walking and praising God:,"Chun, keâ lâwn le Pathien ân pâk chu mi po poin an hmuh a;"
10,"and they took knowledge of him, that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.","biekin kawtkhâr, Mawi, bula kut dawa ṭhung hlak kha a nih ti an hriet a; a chunga thil tlung chu mak an ti bêk bêk a, an buoi hle el a."
11,"And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.","Chun, ama chun Peter le Johan chu a chel zing laiin, mi po poin mak an ti bêk bêk a, Solomon tuolpûk an tia chun, an kuomah an hung tlân khâwm a."
12,"And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man? or why fasten ye your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?","Peterin chu chu a hmu chun, mihai chu a biek a, “Nangni Israel mihai, hieng hi iengdinga mak in ti am a na? Keini thilthawtheina le Pathien kan ngaisak leia ama hi kan inlâwntir ang el chun iengdinga in mi en zing am?"
13,"The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.","Abraham hai, Isak hai, Jakob hai Pathien, ei thlatuhai Pathien chun, a siehlaw Isu chu a chawimawi ta a ni hi; ama chu in inmantir a, Pilatin insuo a tum khawmin a hmaah in lo dit naw kha."
14,"But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you,","Mi inthieng le feltak kha in dit nawh a, tuolthattu kha in kuoma pêk in ngên ta lem a."
15,and killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.,"Hringna Siemtu chu in that a; nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ama chu mithi laia inthawkin a keitho nâwk tah; chu chu a hretuhai kan nih."
16,"And by faith in his name hath his name made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.","Chun, ama hming ring leiin, a hming chun hi mipa in hmu le in hriet hlak hi a sukhrât tah a nih; anih, ama leia ringna hung um hin, in rênga mithmuah a sukdam var tah a ni hi."
17,"And now, brethren, I know that in ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.","“Nisienlakhawm, unauhai, in hotuhai khawmin an inmâwl leia an thaw ang khan, in inmâwl leiin hieng hi in thaw a nih ti ka hriet."
18,"But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin zâwlnei po po bauah, Krista chun rinum a tuor ding thu ân hriettir lâwk kha; khâng ang khan ân tlungtir ta lem a nih."
19,"Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;","Chuleiin, in suolhai thâibo a ni theina dingin sim unla, ngha kîr nâwk ro,"
20,"and that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you, even Jesus:","chuongchun, Lalpa kuoma in- thawka har hunhai la hung tlung thei a tih, Krista Isu, in ta dinga a iruot khawm kha hung tir thei a tih."
21,"whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old.","Amiruokchu, iengkim siem ṭhat hun a tlung hmakhat chu vânin ama chu a la kawl hri ding a nih; chu siem ṭhat ding thu chu Pathienin leihnuoi insieng tira inthawk a zâwlnei inthieng umhai bauin a hril ta kha."
22,"Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me; to him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you.","Mosie ngeiin, Lalpa Pathienin kei a mi siem ang hin in unauhai lai zâwlnei pakhat siempêk a ti cheu. Ama chun, thu po po in kuoma a hril taphawt chu ngaipêk in tih."
23,"And it shall be, that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.","Chun, mi tûkhawm, chu zâwlnei thu chu ngai naw taphawt chu, mi laia inthawk sukbohmang dai nîng an tih,” a ti kha."
24,"Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.","Anih, Samuel um chena in- thawk zâwlnei po po, an hnunga mihai leh, thu hril taphawt kha, tulai chanchin hi an hril lâwk bawk hlak."
25,"Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.","Nangni hi zâwlneihai le thu- thlung nauhai in nih, Pathienin Abraham kuomah, “ ‘I thlahai leiin khawvêla hnam tin thawveng an tih,’ tiin in thlatuhai kuomah a tiem kha."
26,"Unto you first God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.","Pathienin a Siehlaw chu a ruot a, in suolhai innghatsantir seng cheua mal sâwmpêk ding cheuin, nangni kuomah a hung tir hmasa tak a ni hi,” a ta."
