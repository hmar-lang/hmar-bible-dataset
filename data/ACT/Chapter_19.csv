1,"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples:","Chun, Paula chu khaw sak biel a fang suok zet a, Apollo Korintha a um kâr khan Ephesi chu a tlung a, inchûktir tuhai amanih a hmuh a;"
2,"and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was given.","chun, ama chun an kuomah, “In ring tîr lai khan Thlarau Inthieng in chang am?” a ta. Anni chun a kuomah, “Chang lo, Thlarau Inthieng a um ti khawm kan hriet nawh,” an ta."
3,"And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John’s baptism.","Ama chun, “Ieng baptisma am in chang a?” a ta. Anni chun, “Johan baptisma,” an ta."
4,"And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.","Chun, Paula chun, “Johan khan chu mi kuomah, ‘A mi hung zuitu ding, (Isu chu) in la ring ding a nih,’ tiin simna baptismain a baptis hlak a ni kha,” a ta."
5,"And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.","Chu thu chu an hriet phingleh, Lalpa Isu hmingin baptisma an chang tah a."
6,"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.","Chun, Paulain an chungah a kut ân nghat a, Thlarau Inthieng chu an chungah a hung tlung tah a; chuong- chun ṭawng hrietnaw haiin thu an hril a, Pathien thu khawm an hril tah a."
7,And they were in all about twelve men.,An rêng chun patling sâwm le pahni lai an nih.
8,"And he entered into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading as to the things concerning the kingdom of God.","Chun, Paula chu inkhâwmna inah a lût hlak a, thla thum lai huoitakin thu a hril a, Pathien ram kawng thua chun a sêl a, mi a thlêmthlûk hlak a."
9,"But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.","Nisienlakhawm, a ṭhen chu an kawmaw a, an awi nuom nawh a, mipui hmaah Lam thu chu an hrilsiet phingleh, ama chun anni a fe san a, inchûktirhai chu a kei hran a, ni tin Turanna inchûktirnaah a sêl hlak a."
10,"And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.","Chuong ang ruok chun kum hni lai a thawh a; chuongchun, Asia rama um po po, Judahai le Grikhai khawm- in, Lalpa thu chu an hriet ta rau a."
11,And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:,"Chun, Pathienin Paula kutin thilmak namên ân thawtir nawh a."
12,"insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.","Chuongchun, a taksaa in- thawka inhrûkna puonhai amanih, fênthuohai amanih damnawhai kuomah an hung chawi a, an natna- hai a bo hlak a, an sûnga inthawkin khawhrihai khawm an suok hlak a."
13,"But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.","Chun, Juda invai, thieminzawr tuhaiin amanih, “Paulain a thu a ikhêkpui hlak Isu hmingin kan vau che,” tiin khawhri vawnhai chung- ah Lalpa Isu hming an lam hlak a."
14,"And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.","Chun, Juda mi, thiempu lal pakhat, Skeva chun chuong ang thaw ve hlak naupasal pasari a nei a."
15,"And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?","Nisienlakhawm, khawhri chun an kuomah, “Isu ka awi, Paula khawm ka hriet, nangni ruok chu tuhai am in ni leh?” a ta, a dawn a."
16,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.","Chun, khawhri vawn chun a hung bawh a, an pahni chun a hneh a, a ngam ta lem a, chuongchun, chu ina inthawk chun ruok le hliemin an tlân suok ta rau a."
17,"And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.","Chuongchun, Ephesia um po po, Judahai le Grikhai kuoma chun, chu thu chu ân thang tah a. Chuongchun, an rêngin an ṭih a, Lalpa Isu hming a lien tah a."
18,"Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.","Chun, ringnawhai khawm chu a ṭhen tamtak an hung a, an thilthaw- hai thupha an chawi a, an inphuong tah a."
19,"And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.","Dawihmang a ṭhen tamtak khawmin an lekhabuhai an hung chawi khâwm a, mi po po mithmuah an raw tah a; chun a man an sût a, tangka sîng nga niin an hriet."
20,So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.,"Chuong ang lâwma nasa chun Lalpa thu chu ân dar a, a hne ta pei a."
21,"Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.","Chun, chuong zoa chun Paulain, Makedonia ram le Akaia ram chu fang suok phawt a, Jerusalema fe a lungril a, “Chutaka ka fe zo chun Rom ka sir bawk ding a nih,” a ta."
22,"And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.","Chuongchun, a ṭhangpuitu pahni, Timothe le Erasta chu, Make- doniaah ân fetir zet a, ama ruok chu Asia ramah a um hrih a."
23,And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.,"Chun, chuong lai vêl chun Lam thu lei chun mi buoi namênin an buoi ta nawh a."
24,"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen;","Mi pakhat a hming Demetria, tangkaruo suttu, tangkaruoa Diana biekna in siemtu chun, a siemthiem- hai kuomah inhlawna tamtak a pêk hlak a."
25,"whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth.","Ama chun anni chu a ko khâwm a, an sinthaw ang thawtuhai leh; chun, an kuomah, “Puhai, hi sin hi ei hausakna a nih ti in hriet."
26,"And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:","Hitaka Ephesi chaua hin ni loin Asia ram khawvêl po po deu thawa khawm, hi Paula hin, ‘Kuta siem pathienhai hi Pathien an ni nawh,’ tiin mi tamtak a thlêmthlûk a, ân kaitir zo tah ti nangni ngeiin in hmuin in hriet bawk a."
27,"and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.","Chuongchun, ei sinthaw lân a tih ti chau khawm hi ni loin, pathiennu ropuitak Diana biekin khawm hi hung ngaitlâwm an ta, Asia rama mi po po le khawvêla miin an biek hlak hi, a ropui vei leh, tlâwm a tih ti ṭi a um bawk a nih,” a ta."
28,"And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","Chun, chuong thu chu an hriet phingleh an lunginsen ta bêk bêk a, “Ephesia mi Diana hi ropuitak a nih!” tiin an khêk a."
29,"And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel.","Chuongchun, a khuoin an buoi tah a, Gaia le Aristarka, Makedonia rama mi, Paula hnungzuituhai chu an man a, inthuruolin ennuom siemna inah an tlânpui a."
30,"And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.","Chun, Paulain mipui lai lût a tum chun, inchûktirhai chun an phal nawh a."
31,"And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre.","Chun, Asia rama hotutakhai laia ṭhenkhat tuhai amanih Paula ruolhai an na, a kuomah mi an tir a, ennuom siemna ina chun lût ṭâl lo dingin an ngên a."
32,"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.","Chun, umkhâwmhai chu an buoi a, mi tam lem chun an inkhâwmna san khawm an hriet nawh a, chuleiin ṭhenkhat thu pakhatin an khêk a, ṭhenkhat thu dangin an khêk a."
33,"And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defence unto the people.","Chun, mipui laia mi ṭhenkhatin an thiemna thu hril dân ding chu Alexandra an hril a, Judahaiin ama chu mi hma tieng chun an nam lût a, Alexandra chun a kutin a zâp a, mi po po kuoma chun an thiemna thu hril a tum a."
34,"But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu Juda mi a nih ti an hriet phingleh, dârkâr hni lai, rawl inruoltakin, “Ephesia mi Diana hi ropuitak a nih” ti ruokin an khêk a."
35,"And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?","Chun, khaw lekhaziektuin mi- pui chu a vaudei zo chun, “Ephesia mihai, Diana ropuitak biekin le vâna inthawka milim tla kha, Ephesia mihai hi a vêngtu in ni ti, tû am a hre naw an um a?"
36,"Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.","Chuongchun, hieng thu hi sêl ruol a ni naw hnung chun in to zing ding a nih, thu dâwn loin iengkhawm in thaw ding a ni nawh."
37,"For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.","Hieng mihai hitaka in hung ṭhuoihai hi, biekin suomhmanghai an ni nawh a, ei pathiennu hrilsetu hlak an ni bawk nawh."
38,"If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.","Chuongchun, Demetria le a ruol themthiemhai khawmin tû chunga khawm thupawi an nei chun thupawi hrilna inhai chu hawng zing a nih annâwm, lal aiawtuhai khawm an um a; insâl raw se."
39,"But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.",Thil dang pawi hrim nei in ni chun inkhâwm pângngaiah rem an tih.
40,"For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day’s riot, there being no cause for it: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse.","Vawisûna nasêtum lei hin suosal ṭiumin ei um ta hi, a bul um si loin; chuongchu a ni leiin, hi inkhâwmna san hi iengkhawm ei hril thei âwm naw hi,” a ta."
41,"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.","Chun, chuong ang thu a hril zo chun, umkhâwmhai chu ân ṭintir tah a."
