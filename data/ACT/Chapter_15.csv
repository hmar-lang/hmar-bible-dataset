1,"And certain men came down from Judæa and taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.","Chun, mi tuhai amanih Judai rama inthawkin an hung thlah a, “Mosie dân anga ser in intantir naw chun sandam ni thei naw ti niu,” tiin unauhai chu an inchûktir a."
2,"And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, the brethren appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.","Chuongchun, Paula le Barnaba chu anni le chun insêl namêna an insêl nawa an inkhing tlat leiin, Paula le Barnaba chu, anni laia tuhai amani leh, chu thubuoi chunga chun, Jerusalema tirkohai le upahai kuoma hang fe dingin an ruot a."
3,"They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.","Chuongchun, kohran chun an hang inthlah a, anni chun Jentailhai nghat kîr nâwkzie thu chu hril peiin Phoiniki ram le Samari ram an fang suok tah a; chuongchun, unauhai po po an suklâwm bêk bêk a."
4,"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them.","Chun, Jerusalem chu an hang tlung chun, kohranhai, tirkohai, upahai chun an lo lâwm a, chun, Pathienin anni hmanga thil a thaw- hai po po chu an hril a."
5,"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.","Nisienlakhawm, Pharisai pâwl, ring ve tuhai amanih an tho a, “Jentailhai ser tan ding a nih. Mosie dân zâwm khawm anni chu tiem kher ding a nih,” an ta."
6,And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter.,"Chun, tirkohai le upahai chu, chu thu chu ngaituo dingin an inkhâwm a."
7,"And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.","Chun, an insêl rak hnungin Peter a tho a, an kuomah, “Unauhai, Jentailhaiin keia baua Chanchin Ṭha thu hrea awi dingin, Pathienin inhmaa nangni laia inthawka a mi ruotzie kha in hriet."
8,"And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us;","Chun, lungril hretu Pathienin eini a mi pêk ang bawk khan, Thlarau Inthieng an kuoma pe vein, an chungah a lâwm ti ân hriettir a;"
9,"and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.","chun, anni le eini thlier bîk loin, ringnain an lungril a sukthieng tah a."
10,"Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?","Chuongchun, ei thlatuhai le eini izo ta naw, rîngkawl kha inchûktirhai chungah tuhin innghat tumin ieng- dinga Pathien var in sêlkal am a na?"
11,"But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.","Anni ring ang bawkin eini khawmin Lalpa Isu lunginsietna leia sandam ding niin ei ring sih a,” a ta."
12,And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.,"Chuongchun, mipui po po an to zing a, Barnaba le Paula Pa- thienin anni hmanga Jentailhai laia inchiknahai le thilmakhai a thaw thu kha an hril sûng po chu an ngai a."
13,"And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:","Chun, an hril zoin Jakobin a hril ve thung a; “Unauhai, ka thu lo ngai ta u,"
14,"Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.","Pathienin ama hming put dingin, anni laia mihai la suok dingin Jentailhai a hung kan tîr thu kha, Simeon hin a hril tah."
15,"And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,","Chun, chuong thu le zâwlneihai thu hi ân hme a nih:"
16,"After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up:","‘Chuong zoa chun kîr nâwk ka ta David bâwktê chim kha siem nâwk ka tih, A sietna lai po khawm siem ṭha nâwk ka ta;"
17,"That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,","Mi dang, Jentailhai po po ka hming mîn ṭawmpuihai chun, Lalpa an zawngna dingin Chu bâwktê chu tungding ka tih, tiin,"
18,"Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of old.","Khawvêl siem tîra inthawkin hieng thu inhriettir hlaktu Lalpa chun a tih,’ ti ziek ang khan."
19,"Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;","“Chuleiin, hieng ang hin ka ruot a nih. Jentailhai laia Pathien tieng nghahai chu sukrinum naw inla,"
20,"but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.","milim biekna thil inthiengnaw fâk dâm, indit dâm, sa râkhlum le thisen fâk dâm bân dingin an kuomah ziek lem inla ka ti tak a nih."
21,"For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.","Mosien inhmaa inthawk tah khaw tinah a thu khêkpuitu a nei hlak sih a; inkhâwmna inahai Châwlni taphawt chun a thu chu tiem a ni hlak kha,” a ta."
22,"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:","Chun, tirkohai, upahai kohran po pohai le chun, an pâwla mi thlanga, Paula le Barnaba ruolin Antiokeia infetir ṭha an tih a; an ithlanghai hming chu Juda (Barsaba an ti) le, Sila an nih; anni chu unauhai laia hotu deu an nih."
23,"and they wrote thus by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:","Chun, hieng ang hin an ziek a, an kutah an inphur a; “Tirkohai le unauhai laia upahaiin Antiokeia dâm, Suria rama dâm le Kilikia rama Jentail unau umhai chibai an bûk."
24,"Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;","“Kan pâwl laia mi tuhai amaniin thu hrilin an sukbuoi cheu a, in lungril an suklungzîng ti kan hriet a, an kuomah thu iengkhawm kan pêk si nawh."
25,"it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,","Chuleiin, inthuruola kan in- khâwmin, kan dittak Barnaba le Paula,"
26,men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.,"Lalpa Isu Krista hming leia thi dâwnlohai hung ruol hin, mi thlanga in kuoma hung tir ve ṭhain kan hriet a."
27,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.","Chuongchun, Juda le Sila kan hung tir a ni hi, anni khawmin hieng thu bawk hi ṭawng bauin hril an ti cheu."
28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:","Thlarau Inthieng le keinîn, hieng thu pawimaw naw hi chu phur rik zuol in chungah innghat naw inla, a ṭha kan tih;"
29,"that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.","milim biekna sa fâk dâm, indit dâm ma unla kan tih. Hieng hi in ma chun in ta dingin ṭhâng a tih. Damtakin um ro,” tiin."
30,"So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.","Chuongchun, an itir chun an feh a, Antiokei chu an zu tlung a. Mipui chu an ko khâwm a, lekha chu an pêk a."
31,"And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.","Chun, an tiem zoin thlamuong- na thu lei chun an lâwm ta hleh a."
32,"And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.","Chun, Juda le Sila chu zâwlnei an ni bawk a, thu tamtakin unauhai chu an thlamuon a, an sukdet a."
33,"And after they had spent some time there, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.","Chun, chutaka chun sâwt rei an um hnungin, anni hung tirtuhai kuomah kîr nâwk dingin unauhai chun thlamuongtakin an infetir nâwk tah a,"
34,,(Sila ruok chu chutaka um zing a tum a.)
35,"But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.","Paula le Barnaba ruok chu Antiokeia chun Lalpa thu inchûktir le hrilin an um zing a, mi dang tamtakhai leh."
36,"And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they fare.","Chun, ni iengzat amanih hnunga chun, Paulain Barnaba kuomah, “Tuhin fe nâwk inla, khaw tina Lalpa thu ei hrilna taphawta unau umhai kha kan pei inla, an um dân en ei tih,” a ta."
37,"And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.","Chun, Barnaba chun Johan, (Marka an ti chu), an kuoma ṭhuoi ve a tum a, Paula ruok chun, ama chu an kuoma ṭhuoi chu ṭha a ti nawh a."
38,"But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.","Pamphulia ramah anni a kîr san a, sinthawnaa an kuoma a fe ve ta naw lei khan."
39,"And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus:","Chuongchun, nasatakin an lo insêl tah a, an inṭheh a, Barnaba chun, Marka chu a kuomah a ṭhuoi a, Kupra thlierkâr tieng lawngin a fe tah a."
40,"but Paul chose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.","Paula ruok chun, Sila a thlang a, unauhaiin Lalpa lunginsietna an inkawltir hnungin a fe suok tah a."
41,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.","Chun, kohranhai chu sukdet peiin Suria le Kilikia ram a fang suok tah a."
