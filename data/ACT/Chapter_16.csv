1,"And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.","Chun, Derbe le Lustraa chun a fe bawk a; chun, chutaka chun, a hming Timothe inchûktir pakhat a um; ama chu ringtu Juda nuhmei naupa a na, a pa ruok chu Grik a nih;"
2,The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.,"Lustra le Ikonioma unau umhai chun, ama chu an inpâk hlak a."
3,Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.,"Paulain ama chu a kuoma fe ve dingin a dit a; chuongchun, chu tienga Juda umhai lei chun, a ser a tanpêk a, a pa chu Grik a nih ti an hriet vawng sih a."
4,"And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.","Chun, khaw tinah an fe malamin Jerusalema tirko le upa umhai thurêl kha zâwm dingin unauhai kuomah an pêk pei a."
5,"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.","Chuongchun, kohranhai chu ringnaa chun an det tah a, ni tin an pung ta deu deu a."
6,"And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;","Chun, Thlarau Inthiengin Asia rama thu hril a khap leiin Phrugia le Galati ram chu an fang suok a;"
7,"and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;","chun, Musia ram kâwl an tlungin Bethunia ramah lût an tum a, nisienlakhawm, Isu Thlarauin a phal si nawh."
8,"and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.","Chuongchun, Musia ram chu an khêl a, Troasah an fe thla tah a."
9,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.","Chun, zânah Paulain a mang angin Makedonia rama mi mi pakhat ngîrin, “Makedonia ramah hung kai la, mi ṭhangpui rawh,” tia ngên ngênin a hmuh a."
10,"And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel unto them.","Chun, chu mang chu a mang zo phingleh, Makedonia rama chun fe kan tum tah a, an kuoma Chanchin Ṭha hril dingin Pathienin a mi ko ti kan hriet a."
11,"Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;","Chun, Troasa inthawk chun lawngin kan suok a, tluongtakin Samotrakiah kan riek a, a zînga chun Neapoliah kan fe nâwk a;"
12,"and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a Roman colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.","chun, chutaka inthawk chun Philippiah kan feh a, chu khuo chu Makedonia rama khaw pakhat a nih, chu biela chun khaw pawimaw tak a na, Roma inthawka mi inpêmhai khuo a nih. Chu khuoa chun ni tam rei kan châm a."
13,"And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.","Chun, Châwlniin kul kawtkhâr puo tienga vadung panga, ṭawng- ṭaina hmun ni dinga kan ringa chun kan feh a; chun, kan ṭhunga nuhmei hung khâwmhai kuoma chun thu kan hril a."
14,"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.","Chun, a hming Luda, puon senduk zawrtu, Thuotira khuoa mi, Pathien betu nuhmei pakhatin kan thu a hriet a; chun Paula thu hril zâwm dingin Lalpa chun a lungril a sukvar tah a."
15,"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.","Chun, ama le a sûnghaiin baptisma an chang zo chun, “Lalpa ring tak zeta in mi ruot chun, ka inah hung tlung ro,” tiin a mi ngên a mi ngên a, a mi chel tah a."
16,"And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.","Chun, ṭawngṭaina hmuna kan fe lai chun suok nunghâk tû amanih, khawhri aisânthiem zâwlin a mîn tuokpui a, ama chun a aisân lei chun a puhai chu sum tamtak ân hmutir hlak a."
17,"The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.","Ama chun Paula le keini a mi zui a, “Hienghai, sandamna lampui hriltu cheu hi, Achunghnungtak Pathien suokhai an ni hi,” tiin a khêk a."
18,"And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.","Chuong ang chun, ni sâwt rei a thaw hlak a. Chuongchun, Paula chu a lungni ta nawh a, a nghah a, khawhri kuoma chun, “Isu Krista hmingin a sûnga inthawkin suok thu ka pêk che,” a ta. Chun, chu lai tak chun a suok nghâl tah a."
19,"But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,","Chun, a puhai chun an sum hmuna ân hmang ti an hriet a, Paula le Sila chu an man a, hotuhai hmaah dâwr hmunah an kei lût a."
20,"and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,","Chuongchun, thu rêltuhai kuomah an ṭhuoi a, “Hienghai hi Judahai an na, kan khuo an sukbuoi bêk bêk a,"
21,"and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.","dân kan pawm thiengnaw le kan zâwm thiengnaw dâm an hril a, Rom mi kan ni sih a,” an ta."
22,"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.","Chuongchun, mipuihai khawm chu tirkohai thaw ding chun an hung inthawk veh a, thu rêltuhai chun an puonhai an the thlâkpêk a, hmawla vuok thu an pêk a."
23,"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:","Chun, vawi tamtak an vuok zoin intângna inah an khum a, a vêngtu kuomah himtaka vêng ding an ti tlat a."
24,"who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.","Chuong ang lâwma thu an pêk leiin rip sûngrilah a khum a, an kehaia chun thing kawl ân buntir a."
25,"But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;","Nisienlakhawm, zân rila chun, Paula le Sila chu Pathien kuomah an ṭawngṭai a, hla an sak a, intânghai chun an ngai a;"
26,"and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened; and every one’s bands were loosed.","chun, kârloin simkhawleihnuoi nasatakin a hung inhnîng a; chun, kawtkhâr po po chu ân hawng nghâl a, mi tin kawl bunhai chu a hung insût vawng tah a."
27,"And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.","Chun, a vêngtu a ininnghil chu a hung har a, intângna in kawt- khârhai chu inhawngin a hmuh a, intânghai chu an tlân hmang amanih a ta, kâwlhnâm a phawi a, insukhlum a tum a."
28,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula chu rawl inringtakin a khêk a, “Iengkhawm inlaw naw, kan rêngin hitaka hin kan la um vawng annâwm,” a ta."
29,"And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,","Chun, a vêngtu chun khâwn- varhai a lam a, ân châwm lût a, ṭia inthin pumin Paula le Sila hmaah a bawkkhup a."
30,"and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?","Anni chu a ṭhuoi suok a, “Puhai, sandama um dingin ieng am ka thaw ding?” a ta."
31,"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.","Chun, anni chun, “Lalpa Isu ring la, chuongchun, sandamin um i tih, nang le i sûnghai leh,” an ta."
32,"And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.","Chun, a kuoma le a ina um po pohai kuoma chun Pathien thu an hril a."
33,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.","Chu zân chun, chu lai le le chun, a ṭhuoi a, an vuokna invuolhai chu a sâwpfai a; chun, ama le a sûnghai po po chun baptisma an chang nghâl tah a."
34,"And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.","Chun, a inah a hang ṭhuoi a, fâk ding a pêk a, chun, Pathien an ring leiin, ama chu, a sûnghai po po le chun an hlim ta bêk bêk a."
35,"But when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.","Chun, nisa a suok chun rorêltuhai chun, “Kha hai kha insuo rawh,” ti dingin manmihai an tir a."
36,"And the jailor reported the words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.","Chun, intângna in vêngtu chun, Paula kuomah an thu a hril a, “Rorêltuhai chun insuo ding cheuin mi an hung tir a; chuleiin, tuhin hung suok unla, thlamuongtakin fe ro,” a ta."
37,"But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula chun an kuomah, “Rom mi kan ni sih a, kan thiem le kan thiem naw hre loin vântlâng mithmuin an mi vuok a, intângna inah an mi khum a; tuhin inrûkin an mi hnawt suok vei ding a ni maw? Ni der naw ni; anni ngei hung hai sienla mi hung ṭhuoi suok raw hai se,” a ta."
38,And the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;,"Chuongchun, manmihai chun, chuong thu chu rorêltuhai kuoma chun an hril a. Chun, Rom mi an nih ti an hriet chun an ṭi tah a."
39,"and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.","An va feh a, an thlêm a, an ṭhuoi suok a, khuoa inthawk chun fe hmang dingin an ngên a."
40,"And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.","Chun, intângna ina inthawk chun an suok a, Luda ina chun an lût a; chun, unauhai chu an hmuh a, an thlamuon a, an suok tah a."
