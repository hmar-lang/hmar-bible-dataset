1,"And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.","Chun, Paula chun rorêltuhai chu a en zing a, “Unauhai, vawisûn chen hin Pathien mithmua ṭha tienga ka hriet taphawt chu thawin ka um hlak,” a ta."
2,And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.,"Chun, thiempu Laltak Anania chun, Paula kâwla ngîrhai kuomah, a baua benpêk ding a ta."
3,"Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?","Paula chun a kuomah, “Nang lung bang nâlvârpa, Pathienin ben lem a ti che; nang Dân anga mi ngai- tuo dingin i ṭhung a, Dân naw anga mi ben ding i ti vei a ni maw?” a ta."
4,"And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?","Chun, a kâwla mihaiin, “Pathien thiempu Laltak i hal vei maw?” an ta."
5,"And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.","Chun, Paulain, “Unauhai, thiem- pu Laltak a ni ti ka hriet nawa a nih, ‘I chipuihai hotu chungah thu ṭhanaw hril naw’ ti khawm ziek a ni sih a,” a ta."
6,"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.","Chun, Paulain a ṭhen Saddukai, a ṭhen Pharisaihai an nih ti a lo hrietin rorêltuhai lai chun a khêk a, “Unauhai, Pharisai ka nih, Pharisai naupa khawm ka nih; beiseina le mithi thonâwkna thuah suosalin ka um a ni hi,” a ta."
7,"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.","Chun, chu chu a hril phingleh, Pharisaihai le Saddukaihai an lo insêl a, rorêltuhai chu an inkhing tah a."
8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.","(Saddukaihaiin, “Mithi thonâwk- na hrim a um nawh, vântirkohai, thlarauhai khawm an um bawk nawh,” an ti hlak; Pharisaihai ruok chun chu kawng pahni chu a um an awi sih a.)"
9,"And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?","Chuongchun, nasatakin an buoi tah a; Pharisai tienga mi Dân inchûktirtu ṭhenkhat an ngîr a, an sêl a, “Hi mipa hi a suolna iengkhawm kan hriet nawh ie; thlarau khawmin, vântirko khawmin ama hi be sienla ieng am pawi a ta?” an ta."
10,"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.","Chun, an insêl nasa deu deu leiin, sipai hotu laltak chun Paula an kei nâwi a ṭih a, sipaihai kuomah, zu fea anni laia inthawka kulbînga hung ṭhuoi lût el dingin a ta."
11,"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.","Chun, zâna chun Lalpa chu Paula kâwlah a ngîr a, “Thlamuong- takin um rawh, Jerusalema ka thu în hriettir ang bawkin Roma khawm în hriettir ding a nih,” a ta."
12,"And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.","Chun, nisa a suok chun Judahai an ṭhang ruol a, Paula an that hmakhat chu iengkhawm faa dâwn lo dingin an inkhâm a."
13,And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.,Chu thu phierrutuhai chu sâwmli nêka tam lem an nih.
14,"And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.","Anni chu thiempu lalhai le upahai kuomah an feh a, “Paula kan that hmakhat chu iengkhawm intem lo dingin kan inkhâm tah a nih."
15,"Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.","Chuleiin, nangnîn, rorêltuhai le a thu fel nâwkzuola ngaituo tum angin, in kuoma ṭhuoi thla dingin sipai hotu laltak kuomah pehêl deuin hang hril ro; in kâwl hnai a tlung hma khawmin keini ama that dingin kan inpei zing a nih,” an ta."
16,"But Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.","Nisienlakhawm, Paula farnu naupa chun an inchân thu chu a lo hriet a, kulbînga chun a va lût a, Paula a va hril a."
17,"And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.","Chun, Paula chun sipai za hotu pakhat a ko a, “Hi tlangvâl hi hotu laltak kuoma chun ṭhuoi rawh; a kuomah thu ieng amanih hril ding a nei a ni âwm ie,” a ta."
18,"So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee.","Chuongchun, sipai hotu laltak kuoma chun a va ṭhuoi a, “Paula intâng khan a mi ko a, hi tlangvâl hi i kuoma hung ṭhuoi dingin a mi tir a, i kuomah thu ieng amanih hril ding a nei a ni âwm ie,” a ta."
19,"And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me?","Sipai hotu laltak chun, a kutah a chel a, a fe hranpui a, inrûkin, “Ieng am mi hril ding i nei chu?” a ta, ân dawn a."
20,"And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul to-morrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.","Chun, ama chun, “Paula thu fel nâwk zuola i ngaituo ding angin, zîngah rorêltuhai kuoma ṭhuoi thlâk dingin Judahaiin hni che an remti tlâng a."
21,"Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee.","Nisienlakhawm, an thu lo awi naw rawh; anni laia mi sâwmli nêka tam lemin an inchân zing a, chuonghai chun ama an that hmakhat chu iengkhawm faa dâwn lo dingin an inkhâm a; tuhin i thu nghâkin inpei sa zingin an um a nih,” a ta."
22,"So the chief captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me.","Chun, sipai hotu laltak chun tlangvâl chu ân fetir a, “Hieng thu hi i mîn hriettir tah ti tukhawm hril naw rawh,” a ta."
23,"And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Cæsarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:","Chun, sipai za hotu pahni a ko a, “Zân, zâl hun pha, Kaisari chena fe ding sipai za hni leh, sakawr chung chuong mi sâwmsari leh, fei chawi mi za hni leh siem ro,” a ta."
24,"and he bade them provide beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.","Chun, Bawrsâp Felik kuoma chun, himtaka ân tlun theina dingin, Paula an inchuongtirna dingin sahai lo siem ding a ti bawk a."
25,And he wrote a letter after this form:,"Chun, hieng ang hin lekha a ziek a;"
26,"Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.",“Klaudi Lusiain Felik Bawrsâp ṭhatak chibai a bûk.
27,"This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.","“Hi mipa hi Judahaiin an man a, an that ding laiin an kuomah sipaihai ṭhuoiin ka feh a, Rom mi a nih ti ka hriet a, ka san suok tah a."
28,"And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their council:","Chun, an hêkna san hriet ka nuom a, an rorêltuhai kuomah ka ṭhuoi thlâk a."
29,"whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.","Chuongchun, an dân thu ieng ienga manih hêk a nih ti ka hriet a, nisienlakhawm, an hêkna thuah thina le khuopna khawp rau dingin iengkhawm ka hriet si nawh."
30,"And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee.","Chun, Judahaiin ama an inchân ti miin an mîn hriettir phingleh, i kuomah ama hi ka hung tir nghâl ta a nih, a hêktuhai khawm, a chunga thupawi an nei taphawt chu i hmaa hril dingin thu ka pêk bawk a,” tiin."
31,"So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.","Chuongchun, sipaihai chun a thupêk ang chun, Paula chu a zân a zânin an ṭhuoi a, Antipatri an tlungpui a."
32,"But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:","A zînga chun sakawr chung chuong mihai chu, ama le fe pei dingin an kîr san a, kulbînga chun an fe nâwk tah a."
33,"and they, when they came to Cæsarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.","Chun, anni chu Kaisari khuo chu an tlung a, Bawrsâp kuomah lekha chu an pêk a, Paula khawm a hmaah an inngîrtir a."
34,"And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,","Bawrsâp chun a tiem zoin Paula umna ram ân dawn a. Chun, Kiliki ram mi a nih ti a hriet phingleh,"
35,"I will hear thee fully, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s palace.","“A hêktuhai che an hung tlung phingleh, i thupawi ngaituong ka tih,” a ta. Chun, Herod inah vêng ding thu a pêk a."
