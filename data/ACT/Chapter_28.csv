1,"And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.","Chun, kan kai zo chun, thlierkâr hming chu Malta a nih ti kan hriet tah a."
2,"And the barbarians showed us no common kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.","Chu ram mihai chun lunginsiet namênin an mi lo lunginsiet nawh a; ruo a hung sûr lei le a dei leiin mei an sêm a, kan rêngin an mi lo lâwm a."
3,"But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.","Chun, Paula chun thing têl khat ân khâwm a, meia chun a tih a, a lum leiin rûl a hung suok a, a kutah a chuk a, a kawp zing a."
4,"And when the barbarians saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.","Chun, chu ram mihai chun thilhring a kuta inkhai zing chu an hmu chun, “Hi mipa hi tuolthattu a ni phawt el, tuisuorieta inthawkin tlân suok sienla khawm, Phuba latu chun a dam a awi ta naw a ni hi,” an ta."
5,"Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun thilhring chu meiah a thinthlâk a, iengkhawm a ti nawh a."
6,"But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.","Anni ruok chun ân vûng amanih, kârloa thia a tlûk nghâl amanih an ring a; chun, sâwttak an nghâk zing a, iengkhawm a ti nawh ti an hriet chun an lungril an inlet a, “Pathien a ni hi,” an ti ta lem a."
7,"Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius; who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.","Chun, chu hmun kâwla chun chu thlierkâra laltak a hming Publia ram a um a, ama chun a mi lo lâwm a, ni thum lâwmtakin a mîn tlungtir a."
8,"And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.","Chun, Publia pa chu khawsik le santên invawiin a lo zâl zing a; chun, Paula a kuomah a lût a, a ṭawngṭai a, a chungah a kuthai ân nghat a, a sukdam tah a."
9,"And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:","Chu chu a thaw zo chun, chu thlierkâra natna nei po chu an hung a, an dam tâwl tah a; chuhai chun nasatakin an mi chawimawi a,"
10,"who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.","chun, kan fe dingin kan ma- mawhai chu lawngah an sie tâwl a."
11,"And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.","Chun, thla thum chenah a hming Dioskuri, Alexandria khaw lawng, thlasika thlierkâra um tah, chu lawnga chun kan fe tah a."
12,"And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.","Chun, Surakus kan sir a, chutaka chun ni thum kan châm a."
13,"And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;","Chutaka inthawkin kan fe kuol a, Regium kan tlung a; chun, ni khat chenah sim thli a hung hrâng a, a zîng nâwk chun Puteoli kan tlung nâwk a."
14,"where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.","Chutaka chun unauhai kan hmuh a, an kuoma ni sari châm dingin an mi thlêm a; chuong ang chun Rom tieng kan fe ta pei a."
15,"And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.","Chun, unauhaiin kan chanchin an hriet phingleh chutaka inthawk chun Appia Dâwr le Khuolbûk pathum chenah mi tuok dingin an hung a; anni chu a hmu chun Pathien kuomah Paulain lâwmthu a hril a, ân sukhuoi tah a."
16,"And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.","Chun, Roma kan lût chun, Paula chu a vêngtu sipai kuomah a khât chaua um an phal a."
17,"And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:","Chun, ni thum chenah Paula chun Judahai hotuhai deu deu a ko khâwm a; chun, an hung inkhâwmin, an kuomah, “Unauhai, mi po po le ei thlatuhai dân chungah iengkhawm ka thaw naw khawmin Jerusalema inthawkin Roma mihai kuomah an mîn tângtir a nih."
18,"who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.",Anni chun an mi suosal zoin thina khawp meu ka chungah iengkhawm a um naw leiin mîn suo an tum a.
19,"But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.","Nisienlakhawm, Judahaiin chu chu an sêl leiin Kaisar kuomah intlun naw thei ka ni ta nawh a; nisienlakhawm, ka chihai hêkna neia thaw ka ni nawh."
20,For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with me: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.,"Chuong kawnga chun nangni inhmupui ding cheuin le inbiekpui ding cheuin ka ko cheu a nih; Israelhai beisei kân ṭâwmpui leia hi khaidiet hi bun ka ni sih a,” a ta."
21,"And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judæa concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I chanchin Judai rama inthawkin lekhahaiin kan hmu si nawh a, unau- hai hitaka hungin tukhawmin i chunga thupawi an hrilsuok si nawh, phuong khawm an phuong bawk nawh."
22,"But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.","Nisienlakhawm, hi pâwl hi ram tinah hrilsiet a ni sih a, nangin ieng- tin am i ngai a hriet kan nuom,” an ta."
23,"And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded the matter, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.","Chun, ni an tiem a, chu ni chun a tlung inah mi tamtak a kuomah an hung a, zîngkâra inthawkin zântieng chenin an kuomah chu thu chu a hrilfie a, Pathien ram thu ân hriettir a, Mosie Dân Lekhabu thu le Zâwlneihai Lekhabu thuin Isu tieng anni a thlêm a thlêm a."
24,"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.","Chun, a ṭhenin a thu hril chu an ring a, a ṭhen chun an ring nawh a."
25,"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,","An inngei ta nawh a, Paulain thu baukhat a hril zoin an suok tah a. A thu hril chu hi hi a nih: — “Thlarau Inthiengin zâwlnei Isai bauin in thlatuhai kuoma a hril kha ân dik ngawt el,"
26,"saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:","Hi chihai kuoma hin va hril rawh: ‘Na chun chu hre de ti niu a, a ngaina ruok chu hre tawp naw ti niu, Hmu chu hmûng in ta, hriet chu hre tawp naw ti niu;"
27,"For this people’s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.","Hi chihai lungril hi a lo ngawng tah a, An nahai a lo sêt deu a, An insîm bawk a, Chuong naw chun ei mitin hmûng ei ta, Ei nain hrieng ei ta, Ei lungrilin hre bawk ei ta, Ngha kîr nâwk rawi ei ta, Amain mi sukdam hlau rawi a tih,’ an tih a,” a ti kha."
28,"Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.","“Chuongchun, Pathien sandam- na thu hi Jentailhai kuomah inphur a nih ti hi hre ro, anni chun chu ngai khawm ngai an tih,” a ta."
29,,"[Chuongchun, hieng thuhai hi a hril zo chun, Judahai chu an ṭin a, anni le anni nasatakin an insêl a.]"
30,"And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,","Chun, Paula chu kum hni pumhlûm ama in hawah a um a, a kuoma lût taphawt a lâwm hlak a,"
31,"preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.","Pathien ram thu a hril a, Lal Isu Krista thu khawm huoitakin ân chûktir hlak, tukhawmin ama an khap si nawh a."
