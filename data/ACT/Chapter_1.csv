1,"The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,","Theophil, kha hmaa lekhaa khan, Isu thilthaw le a închûktir phut lai thu po po kha ka ziek a nih;"
2,"until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen:","Thlarau Inthieng ṭhangpuia a tirko thlanghai kuoma thu a tiem zoa, vân tienga ṭhuoia a um ni chena thu kha."
3,"to whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God:","Chu tirkohai kuoma chun rinum chu a tuor hnungin inhriettirna tam- takin hringin ân entir a, ni sâwmli zet an kuomah ân lâr a, Pathien ram thu a hril hlak."
4,"and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye heard from me:","Chun, an umkhâwm dâm a pâwl veh a, “Jerusalem fe san naw ro, Pathien thiltiem ka hril in hriet kha lo nghâk ro,” a ti tlat a."
5,for John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence.,"“Johan khan tuiin a baptis hlak a, nisienlakhawm, ni sâwtnawtêah Thlarau Inthiengin baptisma chang in tih,” a ta."
6,"They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?","Chun, anni chun an hung inkhâwmin a kuomah, “Lalpa, tuhin am a ni Israelhai kuoma ram i pêk nâwk ding?” an ta, an indawn a."
7,"And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority.","Chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Pain a hun le a ni ama thu thua um dinga a ruot chu nangni lo hriet ding a ni nawh ie."
8,"But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judæa and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.","Nisienlakhawm, Thlarau In- thieng chu in chungah a hung tlung pha leh thilthawtheina la nei in tih; chuongchun, Jerusalema dâm, Judai le Samari ram khaw tina dâm, kâwlkawdawng chenin ka thu hretuhai nîng in tih,” a ta."
9,"And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.","Chun, chuong thu chu a hril zoin an hmu zing pumin, vân tienga ṭhuoiin a um a; chun, sûmin an hmu phâk nawah a ṭhuoi hmang tah a."
10,"And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold two men stood by them in white apparel;","Chun, a hang fe laia vân tieng an en zing laiin, mi pahni puon vâr silin an kâwlah an hung ngîr a."
11,"who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.","Chuonghai chun, “Galili rama mihai, iengdinga vân tieng nghaa in ngir am? Hi Isu in kuoma inthawka vân tienga ṭhuoia um hi, vâna a hang fe in hmu ang bawk hin ama ngei hi hung nâwk a tih,” an ta."
12,"Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey off.","Chun, Oliv tlâng an tia inthawk chun Jerusalemah an kîr nâwk tah a; chu tlâng chu Jerusalem kâwl a nih. Châwlnia lêngna tâwk chau a nih."
13,"And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.","Chun, an lûtin an umna pindan chunghnunga chun an hang feh a Peter le Johan leh, Jakob le Andri leh, Philip le Thoma leh, Bartholomai le Matthai leh, Alphai naupa Jakob leh, Simon Zelot pâwla mi le Jakob naupa Juda leh an nih."
14,"These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.","Chuonghai po po chun nuhmei tuhai amani le Isu nu Mari leh, Isu unauhai leh, lungril hmunkhata ṭhahnemngaitaka ṭawngṭaiin an um a."
15,"And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons gathered together, about a hundred and twenty),","Chun, chu ni chun unauhai lai Peter a ngîr a, (an rêng chun za le sâwmhni lai an nih),"
16,"Brethren, it was needful that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.","“Unauhai, Thlarau Inthiengin, David baua, Isu mantuhai ṭhuoitu Juda thu a hrillâwk kha, kha Pathien Lekha Thu kha hung tlung ding a ni hrim a nih."
17,"For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry.","Ama chu eini laia tiemsa a na, hieng rawngbâwlnaa hin chan khawm a nei ve sih a."
18,"(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.","(Chun, ama chun a suol manin hmun pakhat ân chawk a, a bawkkhupin a tlah a, a laiah a puok kawi a, a rîl po po a suok vawng a."
19,"And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)","Chun, chuong thu chu Jerusalema umhai po poin an lo hriet a; chuongchun, chu hmun chu anni ṭawngin, ‘Akeldama,’ an tih a, chu chu, ‘Thisen hmun,’ tina a nih.)"
20,"For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be made desolate, And let no man dwell therein: and, His office let another take.","Inpâkna Hla Buah hi thu hi ziek a nih:- ‘A umna sukramin um raw se A sûngah tukhawm um naw raw se,’ ti le, ‘A hotu nîna chu mi dangin chang raw se,’ ti hi."
21,"Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,","“Chuongchun, Lal Isu eini laia lût hlak, suok hlaka a um sûng po a,"
22,"beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.","Johan Baptisma chena in- thawka ei kuoma inthawka vâna ṭhuoia a um ni chen kha - hieng a mi pâwl hlakhai laia mi pakhat, a thonâwkna mi hrietpuitu dingin a um ding a nih,” a ta."
23,"And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.","Chun, mi pahni an ruot a, pakhat chu Josef Barsabba an ti chu, (a hming dang Justa an ti bawk a). Chun, pakhat chu Matthia a nih."
24,"And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen,","Chun, an ṭawngṭai a, “Lalpa, Nang mihriem po po lungril hretu, hienghai hi a tu lem am i thlang mîn hriettir la;"
25,"to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.","Juda chun ama umnaa a fe theina dinga hieng rawngbâwlna le tirko sin a tlâwmsan ai awtu dingin,” an ta."
26,And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.,"Chun, ai an sânpêk a, an aisân chu Matthia chungah a tlu a. Chuongchun, ama chu tirko sâwm le pakhat hai lai chun tiemsa a ni tah a."
