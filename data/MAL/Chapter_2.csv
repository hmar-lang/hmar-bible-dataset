1,"And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.","“Tuhin, aw nangni thiempuhai, hi thutiem hi in ta ding a nih."
2,"If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, then will I send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.","In ngai a, ka hming sukropui dinga, in lungrila in sie tlat naw chun, Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih, in chunga chun ṭawngsie hung tir ka ta, in malsâwmnahai chu ṭawngsie inphur ka tih; anih, lungrila in sie tlat naw leiin, ṭawngsie kân phur nghâl tah a nih."
3,"Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and ye shall be taken away with it.","Ngai ta u, nangni leiin chu chi chu kâwk ka ta, in inthâwina êkhai chu in hmaihai chunga chun thêng ka ta, chun, a chu le chun nangni chu lâk hmangin um in tih."
4,"And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant may be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Ka thuthlung chu Levi kuoma chun a um theina dingin, hi thupêk hi in kuomah ka hung pêk a nih ti hre tâng in tih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
5,"My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name.","Ka thuthlung chu ama ta ding chun hringna le muongna a na; a ṭi theina ding le, ka hming a ṭina ding le, ka hming ṭiha a ngîr theina dingin a kuoma chun ka pêk a nih."
6,"The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.","Thutak dân chu a baua chun a um a, fel nawna chu a hmûrhaia chun hmu a ni hrim hrim nawh; tluongtak le kei le inremin a khawsa a, mi tamtak chu khawhlonaa inthawkin ân her hmangtir tah a nih."
7,"For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.","Thiempu hmûrhai chun hriet- thiemna a vawng ding a na, a baua inthawk chun miin dân chu an zawng ding a ni sih a: ama chu sipaihai LALPA mitir chu a ni sih a."
8,"But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.","Amiruokchu, nangni chu lam- puia inthawk chun in pêt hmang a, mi tamtak chu dâna chun in insuithlûk- tir a; Levi kuoma thuthlung chu in suksiet tah a nih, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih."
9,"Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.","Chuleiin, nangni khawm mi po po hmaa chun hmusitum le inhnuoiin ka lampuihai in hraw naw ang zûl peiin ka siem cheu a nih; dâna chun mi thlierbîk in lo nei ta si lem a,” tiin."
10,"Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?","Pa hmunkhat seng ei ni naw am a nih? Ei Pathien chun a mi siem seng a ni naw am a nih? Ei thlatuhai thuthlung chu bawsea, iengdinga mi tinin mâni unau chungah khaw- hlotaka ei thaw am a na?"
11,"Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah which he loveth, and hath married the daughter of a foreign god.","Juda chun khawhlotakin a lo thaw tah a, Jerusalem le Israel lai khawm chun tirdakumna chu thaw a lo ni tah a; Juda chun LALPAIN in- thiengna a hmangai chu a lo suk- pawrchein, pathien danglam naunu- hmei chu a lo nei tah a."
12,"Jehovah will cut off, to the man that doeth this, him that waketh and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto Jehovah of hosts.","LALPA chun hi thil thawtu, inchûktirtu le a închûktir chu, Jakob puon ina inthawk sât thlâng a tih, sipaihai LALPA kuoma thilinhlânhai inhlântua inthawk le chun."
13,"And this again ye do: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, neither receiveth it with good will at your hand.","Chun, hi khawm hi in thaw nâwk bawk a, LALPA mâichâm chu mitthli le, ṭapna le, thuokdawngnain in inkhum a, chuong lei chun thil inhlân chu a ngaisak ta nawin, in kuta inthawkin ṭhain a pawm ta naw hrim hrim a nih."
14,"Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.","Nangni chun, “Ieng leiin am ie?” in la ti ta rawp a, I thuthlung nuhmei le i kawppui ni sien khawm, a chunga khawhlotaka i lo thaw tah, i tleirâwl lai nuhmei le nanga kâra chun LALPA chu thuhretu a ni sih a."
15,"And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.","Chun, hringna chi chu a nei leiin, ama chun pakhatah a siem a ni naw am a nih? Ieng leia pakhata siem am a na? Pathien chi chu a zawng a nih. Chuleiin, in thlaraua chun fîm- khur unla mi tukhawma a tleirâwl nuhmei chu khawhlotakin thaw naw raw se."
16,"For I hate putting away, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him that covereth his garment with violence, saith Jehovah of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.","“Inmâk hi ka theida a nih,” LALPA, Israelhai Pathien chun a tih, “mâni silfên inpâwngnêknaa inkhum leh,” sipaihai LALPA chun a tih. Chuleiin, in thlaraua chun fimkhur unla, khawhlotaka in thaw nawna dingin."
17,"Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or where is the God of justice?","In thuhai chun LALPA chu in suksâwl a. Anachu, “Khâwlai am ama chu kan suksâwl a?” in ta. Chutaka bawk chun, “Mi tukhawm thil suol thaw chu LALPA mithmua chun ṭha a na, anni chunga chun a lâwm a; amanih, rorêlna Pathien chu khâwlai am a um a?” in ti bawk a."
