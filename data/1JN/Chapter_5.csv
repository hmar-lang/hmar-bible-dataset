1,Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God: and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.,Tûkhawm Isu hi Krista a ni ti ring chu Pathien inei a nih; tûkhawm a neitu hmangai chun a inei khawm a hmangai hlak.
2,"Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.","Hitaka hin Pathien nauhai ei hmangai ti ei hriet, Pathien ei hmangai a, a thupêkhai ei zâwm hin."
3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.","Pathien ei hmangaina chu hi hi a nih, a thupêkhai ei zâwm hi. A thupêkhai chu a khir si nawh a."
4,"For whatsoever is begotten of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, even our faith.","Pathien inei taphawt chun khaw- vêl a hne pei sih a; hi hi khawvêl hnea ngamna chu a nih, ei ringna hi."
5,"And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?",Isu hi Pathien Naupa a nih ti ringtu chau naw chun tuin am khawvêl a hne hlak a?
6,"This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood.","Hi hi a nih tui le thisena hung chu, Isu Krista hi; tui chauah ni loin, tuia le thisenah a ni lem. Inhriettirtu chu Thlarau hi a nih. Thlarau chu thutak a ni leiin."
7,"And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth.","Inhriettirtu chu pathum an um,"
8,"For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.",Thlarau le tui le thisen chu: chuong pathum chu an inthuruol a nih.
9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son.","Mihriem inhriettirna hman ei pawm chun Pathien inhriettirna chu a ropui lem sih a; Pathien inhriet- tirna chu hi hi a nih, “Ka Naupa chanchin kân hriettir tah,” ti hi."
10,He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in him: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son.,"Pathien Naupa ringtu chun mâniah hrietna a nei a nih; Pathien ringnawtu chun ama chu khêlhlipah a siem a nih, Pathienin a Naupa chanchin ân hriettir chu a ring naw leiin."
11,"And the witness is this, that God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.","Inhriettirna chu hi hi a nih, Pathienin chatuona hringna a mi pêk a, chu hringna chu a Naupaah a um a nih."
12,He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life.,"Naupa neitu chun hringna chu a nei a, Pathien Naupa neinawtu chun hringna chu a nei nawh."
13,"These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, even unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God.","Chatuona hringna in nei ti in hriet theina dingin, nangni Pathien Naupa hming ringtuhai kuomah hieng thu hi ka ziek a nih."
14,"And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us:","Hi hi ama chunga ei huoina chu a nih, iengkhawm a ditzâwng anga ei hni chun amain a mi ngai pêk hlak hi."
15,"and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.","Chuongchun, iengkhawm ei hni taphawt a mi ngaipêk hlak ti ei hriet chun, a kuoma ei thil hni chu ei hmu tah ti ei hriet a nih."
16,"If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request.","Tûkhawmin a unau thina khawp nilo suol thawin hmu sienla, hnipêk a ta, chuongchun, Pathienin a hnitu kuoma chun thina khawp nilo suol thawtuhai ta ding chun hringna pêng a tih. Thina khawp suol a um a; chuong ang tieng chun hnipêk a tih ka ti a ni nawh."
17,All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.,"Felnawna po po hi suol a nih, thina khawp nilo suol khawm a um bawk a nih."
18,"We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not; but he that was begotten of God keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not.",Tûkhawm Pathien inei chun thil a suk suol nawh ti ei hriet; Pathien inei khan ama chu a hum zing a. Mi suol chun tâwk khawm a tâwk thei naw hrim a nih.
19,"We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one.","Chun, Pathiena inthawk ei nih ti le, khawvêl pumpui hi Mi Suol thu thuin a um ti ei hriet."
20,"And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.","Pathien Naupa chu a hung a. Mi Indiktak chu hre thei dingin hriettheina a mi pêk ti ei hriet bawk a; chun, eini, a Naupa Isu Kristaa ei um hin Mi Indiktaka chun ei um a nih. Ama chu Pathien indiktak a na, chatuona hringna khawm a nih."
21,"My little children, guard yourselves from idols.","Nauhai, milima inthawkin in siekieng ro."
