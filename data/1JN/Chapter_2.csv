1,"My little children, these things write I unto you that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:","Ka nauhai, thil in suksuol nâwna dingin hieng thu hi in kuomah ka ziek a ni hi. Tûkhawmin thil a suk- suol chun, Pa kuoma mi hrilpuitu Isu Krista mi fel chu ei nei."
2,"and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.","Ama chu ei suolhai thupha- chawina a nih; eini suol chau ni loin, khawvêl po po suol thuphachawina khawm a nih."
3,"And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.","Chun, a thupêkhai pawm ei ni chun, chutaka chun ama chu ei hriet ti ei inhriet."
4,"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;","A thupêkhai pawm si loin, “Ama ka hriet,” titu chu mi khêlhlip a nih, thutak amaah a um nawh."
5,"but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:",Tûkhawm a thu pawm taphawt chu amaa chun Pathien a hmangaina a famkim takzet tah a nih. Amaah ei um ti hitaka hin ei inhriet a nih.
6,he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.,"“Amaah ka um zing hlak,” titu chu, ama a um ang bawk khan a um ve ding a nih."
7,"Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard.","Dittakhai, thupêk thar chu in kuomah ka ziek nawh a; thupêk hlui a tira inthawka in nei kha, ka ziek lem a nih. Chu thupêk hlui chu in thu hriet ta hnung kha a nih."
8,"Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.","Nisienlakhawm, thupêk thar ziek ni bawk naw ning am, (chu chu amaah le nangniah ân lang a nih), inthim chu a bo zing lei le, var taktak chu tuhin a hung var ta leiin."
9,"He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now.","Mâni unau theida sih a, “Varah ka um,” titu chu, tu chen khawm hin inthimah a la um zing a nih."
10,"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.","Mâni unau hmangaitu chu vara chun a um zing a, amaa chun tlûkna hrim a um nawh."
11,"But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.","Mâni unau theidatu ruok chu inthimah a um a, inthimah ân vâk bawk a nih; inthimin a mit a sukdel ta leiin a fena khawm a hriet ngai nawh."
12,"I write unto you, my little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.","Nauhai, ama hming leiin in suolhai ngaidam a ni tâk leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni hi."
13,"I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the Father.","Pahai, ama, a tira inthawka um zing chu in hriet leiin in kuomah ka ziek a nih. Ruoltharhai, mi suol chu in hne tâk leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni hi."
14,"I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one.","Nauhai, Pa chu in hriet leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni kha. Pahai, ama a tîra inthawka um zing chu in hriet leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni kha. Ruoltharhai, in hrât a, Pathien thu nangniah a um zing a, mi suol chu in hne tâk leiin in kuomah ka ziek a ni kha."
15,"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.","Khawvêl hi hmangai naw unla, khawvêla thil umhai khawm hi hmangai bawk naw ro. Mi tûkhawm- in khawvêl a hmangai chun, Pa a hmangaina amaah a um nawh."
16,"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.","Khawvêla thil um po po, tisa châkna dâm, mit châkna dâm, dam sûng ropuina tehlêm dâm hi Paa inthawka suok a ni nawh a, khawvêla suok a ni lem sih a."
17,"And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.","Khawvêl hi a châkna pumin a bohmang zing a nih, Pathien dit- zawng thawtu ruok chu kumkhuoin um zing a tih."
18,"Little children, it is the last hour: and as ye heard that antichrist cometh, even now have there arisen many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour.","Nauhai, hun nuhnung tak chu a ni tah, Krista kaltu hung a tih ti in hriet ang khan, tu khawm hin Krista kaltu tamtak an hung suok tah; chuleichun, hun nuhnung tak a ni tah ti ei hriet."
19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they all are not of us.","Anni chu eini laia inthawkin an suok a, nisienlakhawm, eini mi tak an ni nawh; eini mi tak ni hai sienla, eini kuomah an um ve pei ding a ni sih a. Nisienlakhawm, an rêngin eini mi tak an ni naw vawng ti ân lang fel theina dingin an mi suoksan ta a nih."
20,"And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things.","Mi Inthieng kuoma inthawkin hriek nâlna in chang a, iengkim in hriet a nih."
21,"I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth.","Thutak thu in hriet naw leiin ka ziek a ni nawh a, in hriet lei le, thutakah khêl iengkhawm a suok ngai naw leiin ka ziek lem a nih."
22,"Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, even he that denieth the Father and the Son.",Isu chu Krista a nih ti awinawtu nêka khêlinhlip tu am um an ta? Tûkhawm Pa le Naupa awinaw chu Krista kaltu a nih.
23,"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also.",Tûkhawm Naupa awinaw chun Pa khawm a pawm chuong nawh; Naupa awitu ruok chun Pa khawm a pawm a nih.
24,"As for you, let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. If that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.","Nangni chun chu, a tira in- thawka in hriet kha, nangniah inum- tir zing ro. Chu a tîra inthawka in hriet chu nangniah a um zing chun, nangni khawm Naupaa le Paa chun um zing in tih."
25,"And this is the promise which he promised us, even the life eternal.","Chun, hi hi a nih, ama ngeiin thil a mi tiem kha — Chatuona hring- na hi."
26,These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray.,"Chuong nangni ṭhuoi hmang tumtuhai thu chu, in kuomah ka ziek a nih."
27,"And as for you, the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, ye abide in him.","Nangni chu ama kuoma in- thawka hriek nâlna in hmu kha nangniah a umzing a, tu inchûktir khawm in ngai nawh, ama hriek nâlna chun thil po po thu ân chûktir lem cheu lei le, indiktak a na, khêl khawm a ni naw leiin, chu chu ân chûktir ang cheu khan amaah um zing ro."
28,"And now, my little children, abide in him; that, if he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.","Chuongchun, nauhai, amaah um zing ro; chuongchun, ama chu hung inlâr sien khawm, a hungin a hmaah inzak loin huoitakin um thei ei tih."
29,"If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him.","Ama chu mi fel a nih ti in hriet chun, mi tûkhawm felna thaw chu ama inei a ni ti in hriet."
