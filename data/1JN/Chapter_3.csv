1,"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.","Ngai ta u, Pain a mi hmangaina chu a va nasa de! “Pathien nauahai,” a mîn bûk ta chu; chuong ang chu ei ni hrim a nih. Hi hi lei hin khawvêlin a mi hriet naw a nih, ama chu an hriet naw leiin."
2,"Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.","Dittakhai, tuhin Pathien nauhai ei na, iengtin am ei um ding ti chu a lân lang hri nawh a; ama a hung inlang pha chun ama angin ei um ding a nih ti chu ei hriet, ama chu a um pângngai angtakin ei hmu ding a ni sih a."
3,"And every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.",Tûkhawm ama chunga chu bei- seina nei taphawt chu ama ân thieng angin ân sukthieng hlak.
4,Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.,Tûkhawm thil suksuol taphawt chun dân khawm a bawsiet a nih; suol hi dân bawsietna a ni sih a.
5,And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.,Ama chu suolhai la hmang dingin a hung inlang tah ti in hriet; amaa chun suol iengkhawm a um si nawh a.
6,"Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.","Tûkhawm amaa um zing chun thil a suksuol nawh; tûkhawm thil suksuol chun ama chu a hmu nawh a, hriet khawm a hriet bawk nawh."
7,"My little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:","Nauhai, tû ihlêm khawmin um naw ro; felna thawtu chu a fel a nih, ama a fel ang bawkin."
8,"he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.","Thil suksuoltu chu Diebola suok a nih; Diebol chun a tîra inthawkin thil a suksuol sih a, Pathien Naupa hung inlang san tak chu Diebol sin- thawhai a sukbohmang theina dingin a nih."
9,"Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.","Tûkhawm Pathien inei chun, Pathien chi amaa a um zing leiin thil a suksuol ngai nawh; Pathien inei a ni leiin thil a suksuol thei bawk nawh."
10,"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.","Hitaka hin Pathien nauhai le Diebol nauhai ân hriet a nih; tû- khawm felna thaw naw chu Pathiena inthawka suok a ni nawh a, a unau hmangai naw khawm chu Pathiena inthawka suok a ni bawk nawh."
11,"For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:","Hi hi a tira inthawka thuincha in ihriet kha a ni sih a, ei inhma- ngaituo seng ding a nih, ti hi;"
12,"not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.","Kaina mi suol laia mi, mani unau thattu ang khan um loin. Ieng- leiin am a that a? Ama thilthawhai a suol a, a unau thilthawhai a fel leiin."
13,"Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.","Unauhai, khawvêlin an theida cheu chun mak ti naw ro."
14,"We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.","Unauhai ei hmangai leiin thi- naa inthawkin ei suok a, hringnaah ei lût tah ti ei hriet. Tûkhawm hma- ngaina nei naw taphawt chu thinaah a la um zing a nih."
15,Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.,Tûkhawm a unau theida chu tuolthat a nih; tuolthattu tûkhawm chatuona hringna nei zing hrim an um nawh ti in hriet sih a.
16,"Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.","Hitaka hin hmangaina chu ieng am a ni ei hriet, ama chun ei ta dingin a hringna a pêk ta leiin, eini khawmin unauhai ta dingin ei hring- na ei pêk ve ding a nih."
17,"But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?","Nisienlakhawm, tûkhawm, khawvêl sum neiin, a unau tlasamin hmu sienla, ama chu lainat si naw sienla, Pathien hmangaina chu ama- ah iengtin am um a ti leh?"
18,"My little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.","Nauhai, thu chauin inhmangai nâwm ei niu, lei chauin inhmangai naw bawk ei tiu; thilthaw le titak- zetin ni lem raw se."
19,"Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him:","Chutaka chun thutaka inthawk ei nih ti inhrieng ei ta, ama mithmu ngeiah ei lungril chu thlêm tlai bawk ei tih,"
20,"because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.","ei lungrilin thiemnaw a mîn changtirna kawnga chun, Pathien chu ei lungril nêkin a ropui lem a, iengkim a hriet sih a."
21,"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;","Dittakhai, ei lungrilin thiem- naw a mîn changtir naw chun, Pathien tieng ei huoi a nih,"
22,"and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.","chuongchun, a thupêkhai ei zâwm a, a mithmuah thil lâwmum ei thaw hlak leiin, ei hni taphawt a kuoma inthawkin ei hmu pei hlak a nih."
23,"And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.","A thupêk chu hi a nih, a Naupa Isu Krista hming awi inla, amain thu a mi pêk angin inhmangai tuo bawk inla."
24,"And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.","A thupêkhai zâwm chu amaah a um zing a, ama khawm chu amaah a um zing bawk a nih. Chun, hitaka hin ama chu einiah a um zing ti ei hriet. Thlarau a mi pêka hin."
