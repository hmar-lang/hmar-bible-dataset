1,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.","Dittakhai, thlarau nazawng chu ring naw ro, amiruokchu, thlarauhai chu Pathiena inthawk an ni le ni naw infie ro; thuhriltu tehlêm tamtak khawvêlah an hung suok ta leiin."
2,Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:,Hi hin Pathien Thlarau chu hrieng in tih; thlarau iengkhawm Isu Krista tisaah a hung inchang ti ṭan chu Pathiena inthawk a nih; thlarau iengkhawm Isu ṭan naw chu Pathiena inthawk a ni nawh.
3,"and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.","Chu chu Krista kaltu thlarau, a hung ding in hriet kha a nih; tu khawm hin khawvêlah a um zing tah a nih."
4,"Ye are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.","Nauhai, Pathiena inthawk in na, chuong chu in hne tah, nangnia um chu khawvêla um nêk chun a ropui lem leiin."
5,"They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world heareth them.","Anni chu khawvêla mi an na, chuleiin khawvêla mi angin an ṭawng a, khawvêlin an thu an ngai hlak a nih."
6,"We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.","Eini Pathiena inthawk ei na; Pathien hretu chun ei thu a ngai hlak a, Pathiena inthawka mi ni lo chun ei thu a ngai ngai nawh. Chuonga chun thlarau indiktak le indiknaw ei hriet a nih."
7,"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.","Dittakhai, inhmangai tuo seng ei tiu; hmangaina hi Pathiena inthawka suok a ni sih a; mi tin, hmangaina nei taphawt chu Pathien inei an ni tah a, Pathien an hriet bawk a."
8,He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.,Hmangaina nei naw chun Pathien a hriet nawh; Pathien chu hmangaina a ni sih a.
9,"Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.","Hitaka hin Pathien hmangaina ei chungah a hung inlang tah, ama leia ei hring theina dinga Pathienin a Naupa nei sun khawvêla a hung tira hin."
10,"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.","Hitaka hin hmangaina a um, einin Pathien ei hmangai ka ti a ni nawh a, amain a mi hmangai a, ei suolhai thuphachawina ni dingin a Naupa a hung tir ka ti lem a nih."
11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.","Dittakhai, Pathienin chuong ang lâwma a mi hmangai chun, eini khawm ei inhmangai tuo seng ding a nih."
12,"No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:","Tûkhawmin ienglai khawmin Pathien an hmu ngai nawh. Ei inhmangai tuo chun Pathien einiah um zing a ta, a hmangaina khawm einiah famkim bawk a tih."
13,"hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.","Amaah ei um zing le ama chu einiah a um zing ti hitaka hin ei hriet, a thlarau a mi pêk ta lei hin."
14,And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.,"Chun, Pain Naupa chu khawvêl sandamtua um dingin a hungtir ti ei hmu tah a, ei inhriettir a nih."
15,"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.","Tûkhawm, “Isu hi Pathien Nau- pa a nih,” tia ṭan taphawt chu, amaa chun Pathien a um zing a, ama khawm chu Pathienah a um zing bawk a nih."
16,"And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him.","Pathienin einia hmangaina a inei chu ei hriet a, ei awi bawk a nih. Pathien chu hmangaina a nih, hmangainaa um zing chu Pathienah a um zing a, Pathien khawm amaah a um zing a nih."
17,"Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.",Hitaka hin ei chungah hma- ngaina a famkim tah; rorêl nia ṭi loa ei um theia hin; ama um anga khawvêla hin ei um leiin.
18,"There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.","Hmangainaa chun ṭitna hrim a um nawh; hmangaina famkimin ṭitna a hnawt suok lem hlak a nih, ṭitnaa chun hremna a um sih a; a ṭitu chu hmangainaah a la famkim naw a nih."
19,"We love, because he first loved us.",Amain a mi hmangai hmasak leiin ei hmangai a nih:
20,"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen.","Miin, “Pathien ka hmangai,” tiin a unau theida si sienla, ama chu khêlinhlip a nih; a unau a ihmu zing ta hman a hmangai naw chun, Pathien a ihmu ngai naw chu iengtin am hmangai thei a ta?"
21,"And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.","Ama kuoma inthawkin hi thupêk hi ei nei “Tukhawmin Pathien a hmangai chun a unau khawm a hmangai bawk ding a nih,” ti hi."
