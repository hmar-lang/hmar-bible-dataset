verse_no,en,hmr
1,"That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life","Hringna Thu a tîra inthawka um kha, kan nâin kan ihriet kha, kan mitin kan ihmu kha, kan en zinga kan kuta kan idap kha, chu chu chanchin chu;"
2,"(and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare unto you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us);","(chu hringna chu a hung inlang tah a, kan lo hmuh a, kan inhriettir bawk a, chu chatuon hringna, Pa kuoma um, kan kuoma hung inlang chu, kan hril cheu a ni hi);"
3,"that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ:","chu kan ihriet le kan ihmu chu in kuomah kan hril ve cheu a ni hi, nangni khawma in mi pâwl ve theina dingin; anih, keini pâwlna chu Pa le a Naupa Isu Krista pâwlna a nih."
4,"and these things we write, that our joy may be made full.","Chuongchun, kan lâwm a fam- kim theina dingin hieng thuhai hi in kuomah kan ziek a ni hi."
5,"And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.","Chun, thuincha a kuoma in- thawka kan hriet a, in kuoma kan hril sâwng ding cheu chu hi hi a nih:— Pathien chu var a nih, amaa chun inthim hrim a um nawh."
6,"If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:","Inthima um siin, “Ama ka pâwl,” ei ti chun khêl ei hril a nih, thutak khawm chu ei zâwm nawh."
7,"but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin.","Amiruokchu, ama chu vara a um angin eini khawm vara um ei ni chun, ei inpâwl tlâng a nih, chun, a Naupa Isu thisenin ei suol po po a mi sâwpfai pêk hlak a nih."
8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.","“Suol ka nei nawh,” ei ti chun mâni le mâni ei inhlêm fâwm a, thutak khawm chu einiah a um naw a nih."
9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.","Ei suolhai thupha ei chawi chun, ei suolhai ngaidam ding le, ei felnaw- na po po sâwpfai dingin ama chu ring a umin a fel a nih."
10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.","“Thil ka suksuol nawh,” ei ti chun ama chu khêlhlipah ei siem a, a thu khawm einiah a um naw a nih."
