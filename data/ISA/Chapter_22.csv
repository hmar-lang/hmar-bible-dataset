But ye looked not unto him that had done this, neither had ye respect unto him that purposed it long ago.","Dîl hlui tui umna dingin kulpui pahni inkâra chun tui intling khâwm- na in siem a; nisienlakhawm, chuong thawtu tieng chu in en si nawh a, inhmaa lo siemtu chu in ngaisak bawk nawh."
12,"And in that day did the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:","Chu nia chun LALPA, sipaihai LALPA chun, ṭap ding le, âwm inchum ding le, lu sukkawl ding le, saiip puon dierkei dingin a ko a;"

15,"Thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, who is over the house, and say,","LALPA, sipaihai LALPA chun, hieng ang hin a tih, “Fe la, hi sum enkawltu hrep kuoma hin, Sebnaa, lal in chunga hotua um ngei kuoma chun fe rawh."
16,"What doest thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out here a sepulchre? hewing him out a sepulchre on high, graving a habitation for himself in the rock!","Chun, a kuomah hieng ang hin hril rawh: Hitaka hin ieng am i thawh a?

20,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:","“Chun, chu nia chun ka siehlaw Eliakim, Hilkia naupa chu, ko ka ta;"
21,"and I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.","ama chu i zakawfuol hi inhâktir ka tih, i kâwngkhi hin sukhrât ka ta, i rorêlna hi a kutah inkawltir ka tih; chuongchun, ama chu Jerusalema umhai ta dingin le Juda sûnghai ta dingin pa nîng a tih."

23,And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father’s house.,"Ama chu kilna hi hmun dettaka an kil tlat angin, sukdet tlat ka ta, chuongchun, ama chu a pa sûnghai ta dingin lalṭhungpha ropuitak ding nîng a tih."
24,"And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flagons.","Amaa chun a pa sûnghai ro- puina po po chu la khai vawng an ta, a nauhai le a thlahai, bûr le bêl chîn tinrêng, berbu bûr le bêla inthawka tui siena bûr le bêl po po chenin."
25,"In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it shall be hewn down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off; for Jehovah hath spoken it.","Chu nia chun, kilna, hmun nghettaka kil tlata um chun la dâwl naw nih; sât thlâka umin, tla tâng a ta, a chunga thil rik um chu sukbo- hmangin um tâng a tih, LALPAIN chu chu a hril ta si, sipaihai LALPA chun a tih,” tiin."
