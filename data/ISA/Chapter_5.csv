1,Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:,"Ka idittak thu, a grêp huon chungchâng thu chu, ka idittak ta dingin hlain sak ka tih."
2,"and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.","Ka idittak chun tlâng hnuoi ṭhatna takah grêp huon a nei a, a vêlin hnuoi a cho khur a; a lunghai chu a rût fai a, grêphrui ṭhatak chi a phun a, a laia chun in insâng a bâwl a, chutaka chun grêp sâwrna khur khawm a cho a; chun, grêp raa ra dingin a beisei a, nisienla- khawm, grêp suok elin a hung ra ta lem a."
3,"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.","Tuhin, aw Jerusalema umhai le Juda mihai, lunginsiettakin kei le ka grêp huon inkâra thu hi mi ngai- tuopêk ta u khai."
4,"What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?",Ka grêp huona hin ka thaw ta ang bâk khan chu a chungah ieng am thaw nâwk chuong ding a la um ta rawp a? Grêp raa ra dinga ka beisei vei le khan ieng leia grêp suoka a hung ra el am a ni aw?
5,"And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:","Tuhin ka grêp huon chunga ka thaw ding chu hril ka ti cheu; a hling pal chu la hmang ka ta, fâk zoin um a ta, a lung pal chu sukchim ka ta, sirdein um a tih."
6,and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.,"Sukrêm vawng ka ta; sâtderin um naw nih a, cho phitin um bawk naw nih; buor le hlohlingneihai mâwng lem a tih; sûmhai khawm a chungah ruo hrim hrim insûrtir lo dingin thu pe bawk ka tih."
7,"For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.","Sipaihai LALPA grêp huon chu Israel sûngkuo hi a na, Juda mihai hi a kûng ditumtak chu an ni sih a; rorêlna fel a beisei a, nisienlakhawm, ngai ta, nêksâwrna a hung um ta lem a; felna a beisei a, nisienlakhawm, ngai ta, khêk ri a hung um ta lem a nih."
8,"Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!","Ram lailia an khât chaua an um theina dinga mi ṭhang vena hmun hrim hrim um lo khawp hiel a, in le in inzawmtir pei le, lo le lo inzawmtir peituhai chung chu a rik ie!"
9,"In mine ears saith Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.","Sipaihai LALPA chun ka naah hieng ang hin a tih, “Titakzetin in tamtak, lientak tak, mawitak takhai chu a thlûttu um loin la ram a ta;"
10,"For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.","Grêp huon ṭin sâwm hmunah bath khat chau la pieng a ta, bu chi homer khat tuin epha khat chau a la pieng ding a ni sih a,” tiin."
11,"Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!","Zu hnawt dinga zîngkâr inhma- taka tho a, uoinin a sukrui bûr hma- khat chena zân sâwttak tak chena um hlakhai chu an chung a rik."
12,"And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.","Ṭingṭang le perkhuonghai, khuongtê le theihlehai, uoin leh an ruoiṭhenaahai chun a um hlak a, nisienlakhawm, LALPA sinthaw chu an ngaisâng ngai nawh a, a kut thil- thaw chu an ngaituo ngai bawk nawh."
13,"Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.","Chuleiin, ka mihai chu, hrietna an nei naw leiin, sala ṭhuoiin an um tah a; an mi inzâumhai chu an phîng a ṭâm a, an mipuihai chu dangchârin an dang ân hil zo tah a."
14,"Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend into it.","Chuleiin, Seol chun a châkna chu a lo suklien a, a bau chu inkhi ruollo khawpin a ka tah a, chuong- chun, an ropuina dâm, an mipuihai dâm, an ropui bûr bûrna dâm, anni laia lâwmtaka umhai le chun an lût thla ta duol duol a."
15,"And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:","Mi chînhai chu sukkûnin an um a, mi lienhai chu suktlâwmin an um a, chapo mithai chu sukhnuoiin a um tah a;"
16,"but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.","sipaihai LALPA ruok chu rorêl- naa chawisângin a um ta lem a, Pathien, Mi Inthieng chu felnaa suk- thiengin a um tah a."
17,"Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.","Chun, berâmtehai chu an tlatna hmuna an tla angin tlâng an ta, mi thau hnekhnukhai hmun rama thil- hai chu invâihaiin fâng an tih."
18,"Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;","Iengkhawm ni lo hruihruola khawhlona kei a, tawlailîr hruihruola kei ang suolna kei hlaktuhai chu an chung a rik ie!"
19,"that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!","“Eini hmuna dingin thaw vak sienla, a thil thaw ding chu thaw vak raw se, ei hriet theina dingin Israel- hai Mi Inthieng remruot chu hung hnaiin hung tlung raw se,” ti hlak- tuhai chu."
20,"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!","Thil ṭha naw chu thil ṭha ti a, thil ṭha chu thil ṭha naw ti hlaka, var chu inthima ngaia, inthim chu vara ngai hlaka, thil thlum chu thil khaa ngaia, thil kha chu thil thluma ngai hlaktuhai chu an chung a rik ie!"
21,"Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!",Mâni ngaia varhai le mâni ngaia bengvârhai chu an chung a rik ie!
22,"Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;","Uoin dâwn kawnga mi hrâttak, zu chawkpawl kawnga thahrui nei mihai chu an chung a rik ie,"
23,"that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!","thamna fâk leia misuol thiem inchangtir hlaka, mi fel felna lâkpêk hlaktuhai chu!"
24,"Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.","Chuleiin, meichawkin bupâwl a liek hmang duok duok hlak ang le, hlohna ṭâwl chu meichawka a tlu zawt zawt angin an zung chu hmawn- na angin um a ta, an pâr chu pilvut angin intung lui lui a tih; sipaihai LALPA dân chu an dit nawh a, Israel- hai Mi Inthieng thu chu an ngainêp leiin."
25,"Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.","Chuleiin, LALPA lung chu a mihai chungah ân thawk a, a kut chu an chungah ân let a, a vuok a, chuongchun, tlânghai chu an inthin dur dur a, an ruonghai chu khawlai dungah hmunhnawk ang elin ân hlum rem rum a. Chuong lâwma a thaw khawm chun a lunginsen chu a la bo chuong nawh a; a kut chu a lân let ta rawp a."
26,"And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.","Hnam tin hlataka mihai ta dingin inchikna târ suok a ta, kâwl- kawdawnga inthawka ko dingin fai- fûk a tih; chuongchun, ngai ta, anni chu inhmâwtakin hung vak an tih."
27,"None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:","Anni laia tukhawm sâwl naw ni hai a, insui bawk naw ni hai; tukhawm inlusu naw ni hai a, ininnghil bawk naw ni hai; an kâwngkhi chu sûtthâwlin um naw nih a, an kekawk khitna chu intan bawk naw nih;"
28,"whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses’ hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:","an thalhai chu inzumtak a na, an thalngulhai po po chu kuoi sain a um ṭhup a; an sakawr tinhai chu meitâwklung ang nîng an ta, an tawlailîr kehai chu thlivir ang ela ngai ni bawk an tih."
29,"their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.","An ri inri dur dur chu sakei- baknei inrûm ang el nîng a ta, sakeibaknei vânglaihai inhûk ang elin inri dur dur an tih; anih, inri dur dur an ta, an sa se ding chu sêng an ta, himtakin fe hmangpui an tih, san- suoktu ding tukhawm um naw ni hai."
30,"And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.","Chu nia chun tuisuoriet inri dur dur angin an chungah inri dur dur an ta, chuongchun, miin ram chu an hei thlîr chun, ngai ta, inthim le lungin- zingna ruok nîng a tih, var hlak chu chutaka sûmahai chun sukthimin a um a."
