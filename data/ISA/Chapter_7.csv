1,"And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.","Uzzia nau Jotham naupa Ahaz inlal lai chun, Suria lal Rezin le Israel lal Remalia naupa Peka chu Jerusalem rûn dingin an hang feh a; nisienlakhawm, an hne thei nawh a."
2,"And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.","Chun, David sûnghai chu, “Suria chu Ephraim leh an ṭhang hmunkhat tah,” tiin an hril a. Chuongchun, a lungril le a khuoletuihai lungril chu, ramhnuoi thinghai thliin a sukhnîng suou suou ang hin, sukhnîngin a hung um tah a."
3,"Then said Jehovah unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller’s field;","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Isai kuomah, “Nang le i naupa Sear-jasub chu, dîl sakhnung lem tuilâkna tâwpah, puon sâwptu phûl lamliena chun, Ahaz chu tuok dingin fe suok unla;"
4,"and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.","a kuomah, ‘Fimkhur la, um ṭawk ṭawk rawh, meiser bawng khu mei mei pahni, Suria le Rezin le Remalia naupa lunginsenna nasatak chu, ṭi naw la, i lungril chu inlau naw raw se."
5,"Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,","Suria le Ephraim le Remalia naupa chun an phierrûk che a,"
6,"Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;","Juda chu hang thawin hang suk- buoi inla, chutaka chun ei ta dinga lûtna ding siemin, a lai takah Tabeel naupa chu lalah inṭhungtir ei tiu, tiin."
7,"thus saith the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.","Chuleichun, Lalpa PATHIEN chun hieng ang hin a tih a: An thu phier chu puitling naw nih a, tluong- tlung bawk naw nih."
8,"For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people:","Suria lu chu Damaska a na, Damaska lu chu Rezin ringawt hi a ni el sih a; kum sâwmruk le kum nga bo hmain Ephraim chu chi ti tlâk loa um dingin suksiet vawngin um a tih;"
9,"and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.","chun, Ephraim lu chu Samari a na, Samari lu chu Remalia naupa ringawt el hi a ni sih a. In ring det naw chun sukdetin um ṭhuoi naw ti niu, tiin,’ ti rawh,” a ta."
10,"And Jehovah spake again unto Ahaz, saying,","Chun, LALPA chun Ahaz chu a biek nâwk a,"
11,"Ask thee a sign of Jehovah thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.","“LALPA i Pathien kuomah in- chikna hni rawh; inthûka manih, chungtieng insângtaka manih hni rawh,” a ta."
12,"But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt Jehovah.","Ahaz ruok chun, “Hni naw ning ah, LALPA khawm infie bawk naw ning ah,” a ta."
13,"And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?","Chun, ama chun, “Aw David sûnghai, tuhin lo ngai ta u, mihriem suksâwl hi thil chiretekah in ruot a ni maw? Ka Pathien chen khawm suk- sâwl in nuom rawp hi."
14,"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.","Chuleiin, LALPA ngei chun inchikna pêng a ti cheu a, ngai ta u, nunghâk inthieng pakhat inrai a ta, naupasal nei a ta, a hmingah Im- manuel sak a tih."
15,"Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good.","Ama chun thil ṭha naw tieng dit naw dân a hriet a, thil ṭha tieng dit nachâng a hriet pha chun nênetui kîng le khuoizu fa hlak a tih."
16,"For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken.",Naupang chu thil ṭha naw tieng dit naw nachâng le thil ṭha tieng dit nachâng a hriet hma khawmin lal pahni i theidahai ram chu rausanin um a tih.
17,"Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—even the king of Assyria.","Ephraim chun Juda a ṭhe nia inthawka la tlung ngailo nihai chu LALPA chun i chunga le, i khuoletui- hai chunga le, i pa sûnghai chunga chun intlungtir a tih; Assuria lal ngei chu,” a ta."
18,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.","Chu nia chun LALPA chu Aigupta vadung tâwp rêta tho um le, Assuria rama khuoi um chu ko dingin faifûk a tih."
19,"And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all pastures.","Chuongchun, hung an ta, an rêngin vadung ruom se rek rukahai, lungpui pûka dâm, hlohlingnei po poa dâm, ran tlatna hmun po poahai fûng an tih."
20,"In that day will the Lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.","Chu nia chun LALPAIN rêpvâw haw, Vadungpui khêl rama, Assuria lal um chu hmangin, lu le ke hmul chu mêt fai a ta, khâk hmul khawm mêt fai vawng a tih."
21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;","Chuongchun, chu nia chun mi pakhatin bâwngla pakhat le berâm pahni chau vâi a tih;"
22,"and it shall come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land.","nisienlakhawm, nênetui tam- tak an la pêk ding a ni leiin nênetui kîng fa hlak a tih; ram sûnga la umhai po chun nênetui kîng le khuoizu an la fâk seng ding a ni sih a."
23,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall be for briers and thorns.","Chun, chu nia chun hmun tin, grêp hrui sâng, tangka sâng man umna taphawt chu, buor le hlohling- nei hmun el hung ni tâng a tih."
24,"With arrows and with bow shall one come thither, because all the land shall be briers and thorns.",Ram po po chu buor le hlohling- nei hmun ruok a hung ni tâk leiin chutaka chun thal le thalngul chawi- in fêng an tih.
25,"And all the hills that were digged with the mattock, thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.","Chun, tlâng bâwngtuthlawa cho ta po poa chun, buor le hlohlingnei ṭi leiin hung naw ti nih a, bâwngchalhai intlâttirna le berâm ichîl el ding ni ta lem a tih."
