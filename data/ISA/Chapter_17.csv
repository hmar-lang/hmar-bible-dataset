5,"And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing grain, and his arm reapeth the ears; yea, it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.","Chuongchun, bu sîktupain bu a lâk a, a vuihai chu kuta a ât bawng ang el hi nîng a tih; anih, Rephaim ruoma mihaiin buvui hmu ṭhel an rût ang el hi nîng a tih."
6,"Yet there shall be left therein gleanings, as the shaking of an olive-tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Nisienlakhawm, oliv thing vuok hnunga a zikpui insângtak lêra ra pahni pathum amanih, thing ratak zâr seitaka hai pali panga amanih a um hlak ang hin chutaka chun hmu ṭhel rût ding la um a tih, LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun a tih."

9,"In that day shall their strong cities be as the forsaken places in the wood and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it shall be a desolation.","Chu nia chun an khaw dettakhai chu rampui le tlâng sîpa hmun tlân- san hnung, Israel thlahai hmaa an tlânsan hnung ang khan nîng a tih; chuongchun, hmun râusan ni tâng a tih."

11,"In the day of thy planting thou hedgest it in, and in the morning thou makest thy seed to blossom; but the harvest fleeth away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.","i phun ni chun în huon vêl hlak a, zîngkâr chun i thil chi chu i sukpâr hlak; nisienlakhawm, a ra lo chu lungngaina le natna nasatak nia chun a bo el hlak."

14,"At eventide, behold, terror; and before the morning they are not. This is the portion of them that despoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.","Zântieng chun ngai ta, thil râp- thlâktak a um a nih; chun, khaw var hmain an um ta nawh. Chu chu râl- lâka mi lâkpêktuhai chan a na, a mîn rûkpêktuhai puol chu a ni bawk a."
