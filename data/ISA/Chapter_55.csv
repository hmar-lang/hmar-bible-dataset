1,"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.","Hung ta u, dangchâr taphawthai, tuiahai hin hung ro, tangka nei nawhai khawm hung unla, inchaw unla, fa ro; anih, hung unla, uoin le nênetui tangka pe loin, a man khawm pe loin inchaw ro."
2,"Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.","Bu ni si loah ieng dinga tangka in sêng am a na? Khawp le tlaina ni si loah ieng dinga in tha in sêng am a na? Ka thu nguntakin ngai unla, thil ṭha chu fa ro, in hringna chu thil thau chun hlim raw se."
3,"Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.","In na hung sit unla, ka kuomah hung ro; ngai unla, chuongchun, in hringna chu hring a tih; chun, in kuomah kumkhaw thu thlung ka tih; David kuoma lunginsietna tiem tlat tahai chu."
4,"Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.","Ngai ta, ama chu mi tin ta dinga hretuah ka ruot a, mi tin ta dingin hotua le ṭhuoituah ka ruot a nih."
5,"Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not; and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.","Ngai ta, i hriet naw hnam chu ko i ta, nangma hre ngailo hnam chu i kuomah hung tlân an ta; LALPA i Pathien lei le, Israelhai Mi Inthieng lei chun; ama chun a chawimawi si cheh a."
6,Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near:,"Hmu awla a um lai hin LALPA chu zawng unla, a hnâi lai hin ko ro;"
7,"let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto Jehovah, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.","mi rilo chun a um dân chu bânsan sienla, mi fel naw chun a ngai- tuonahai chu bânsan bawk raw se; LALPA kuomah kîr nâwk raw se; chuongchun, ama chun lo lunginsiet a ta; ei Pathien kuomah kîr nâwk raw se, ama chun a lo ngaidam nasa khawp âwm sih a."
8,"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah.","Ka ngaituohai hi i ngaituohai a ni si nawh a, i um dânhai chu ka um dân a ni bawk nawh, LALPAIN a tih."
9,"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.","Vân khi hnuoi nêka ân sâng lem angin, ka um dânhai hi i um dânhai nêkin ân sâng lem sih a, ka ngai- tuohai khawm hi i ngaituohai nêkin ân sâng lem a nih."
10,"For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater;","Ruo le vûr chu vâna inthawkin a sûr hlak a, khitienga khin a kîr nâwk ngai nawh a, hnuoi hi a châwm lem a, thil ân mâwngtirin ân dertir a, bu chi thetu kuoma chun bu chi a pêk a, fatu kuoma chun fâk ding a pêk hlak a."
11,"so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.","chuong ang bawkin ka baua inthawka ka thu suok chu um a tih: iengkhawm thaw nei loin ka kuomah hung kîr nâwk naw nih a, ka dit ang chu thaw lem a ta, thil thaw dinga ka tirnaa chun hlawtling bawk a tih."
12,"For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands.","Hlimtaka suokin, lungmuong- taka ṭhuoi suokin in um ding a ni sih a, tlâng lienhai le tlâng chînhai chun in hmaah hla sak suok phut an tih, phûl thing po pohai chun an kut ben bawk an tih."
13,"Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle-tree: and it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.","Hlohlingnei nêk chun fâr mâwng lem a ta, buor nêk chun inhmui mâwng lem a tih; chu chu LALPA ta dinga hmingṭhatna ding le, kum- khawtluonga inchikna sukbohmanga um lo ding nîng a tih."
