1,"Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.",Ram rorêltu ta dingin berâm- tehai chu Sela khuo thlalêr tienga uma inthawk chun Zion naunu tlânga chun inphur ro.
2,"For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.","Chuongchun, Moab naunuhai chu vate a bua inthawka rau dara vuong vuonghai angin Arnon vadung kaia chun an um ding annâwm."
3,"Give counsel, execute justice; make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.","Rem mi ruotpêk la, ro mi rêlpêk rawh; i hlim chu sûn laia zân angin siem la, hnawt suoka umhai chu inbîkhmangtir rawh; tlân hmang chu inmantir naw."
4,"Let mine outcasts dwell with thee; as for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nought, destruction ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.","Moabhai laia hnawt suoka umhai chu i kuomah um raw hai se, an ta dingin suksetu hmêla inthawka inbîkna ni rawh; hlêprutu chu ieng- khawm ni loa siemin a um ta sih a, suksietna a bo tah a; nêksâwrtuhai chu rama inthawk hin sukbohmangin an um tah."
5,"And a throne shall be established in lovingkindness; and one shall sit thereon in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.","Chuongchun, lalṭhungpha chu lunginsietnaa sukdetin um a ta, chu chunga chun, David puon ina chun, mi pakhat, rorêlin, rorêlna fel zawng- in, thil fel inhmâwtaka thaw nghâlin, titakzetin ṭhung a tih."
6,"We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogancy, and his pride, and his wrath; his boastings are nought.","Moabhai chapona thu, an chapo êm êm a ni ti ei lo hriet a, an ṭawng mingemzie le an chapozie le, an lunginsenzie thu chu, an uongnahai chu iengkhawm a ni nawh."
7,"Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail: for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn, utterly stricken.","Chuleiin, Moabhai chu Moabhai chunga chun khêk rak rak an ta, mi tin chu khêk rak rak an tih: Kir-hareseth grêp inhro hlawm chu lungsetakin la ṭâng in tih."
8,"For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches thereof, which reached even unto Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness; its shoots were spread abroad, they passed over the sea.","Hesbon lohai chu a châu zo ta sih a, Sibma grêp hrui leh; hnam tin lalhai chun a kûng ṭha mihai chu an suktliek pheng phung a, Jazer khuo chen chenin ân zâm tâwl a, thlalêrah an inzâm lût a, a kauhai chu ân zâm dar sung a; tuipui chu ân zâm kai tah a."
9,"Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the battle shout is fallen.","Chuleiin, Sibma grêp hrui chu Jazer ṭain ṭâng ka tih; aw Hesbon le Eleale, ka mitthli hin buok ka ti che: i nipui rahai chunga le i bu sîk chunga chun indona ri chu a tla ta sih a."
10,"And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither joyful noise: no treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the vintage shout to cease.","Lâwmna chu lâkpêkin a um tah; lo ṭhataka inthawk dâm chun hlimna chu lâkpêkin a um ta bawk a; grêp huonahai chun hlasak hrim hrim um ta naw nih a, ri hlimum hrim hrim um ta bawk naw ni; grêp sâwrna khurahai chun sir sâwrtu hrim hrim- in uoin sir pût ta naw ni hai a; grêp sîk khêk ri chu ka sukbo tah."
11,"Wherefore my heart soundeth like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-heres.","Chuleiin, ka rîhai chu Moab lunginsiet leiin ṭingṭang angin ân rih a, ka phîng sûng chu Kirheres lungin- siet leiin ṭingṭang angin ân ri bawk a."
12,"And it shall come to pass, when Moab presenteth himself, when he wearieth himself upon the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.","Chun, Moab chu ân lang pha chun bâwlhmuna insuksâwla, ṭawngṭai dinga a hmun inthienga a hung pha chun hlawtling naw nih."
13,This is the word that Jehovah spake concerning Moab in time past.,Chuong chu Moab chungchâng thu LALPAIN kha hmaa a hril kha a nih.
14,"But now Jehovah hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and of no account.","Tu ruok hin chu LALPAIN, “In- hlawfa kum tiema kum thum sûngin Moab ropuina chu, a mipui nasatak- hai pumin hmusituma inumtirin um a ta, a la um sunhai chu tlâwmterek el, hril khawp lo nîng an tih,” tiin a hril tah."
