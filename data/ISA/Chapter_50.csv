1,"Thus saith Jehovah, Where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement, wherewith I have put her away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were ye sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away.","LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, “In nu mâkna lekha, ka mâkna chu, khaw lai am a um a? Annawleh, ka leibatnahai a tu tak kuom âm ka zawr cheu a? Ngai ta u, in khawhlonahai leiin a nih zawra in um chu, in bawsietnahai leiin a nih in nu khawm kha mâka a um chu."
2,"Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.","Ieng leiin am ka hung khan mi hrim hrim an um nawh a? Ieng dinga ka ko khan a mi dawn an um nâwm a na? Ka kut hi intlan thei lo dingin suktâwiin a um hrim hrim am a nih? Annawleh, sanhim dingin thilthaw- theina hrim hrim ka nei nâwm a nih? Ngai ta u, ka kâwknain tuisuoriet ka sukkang hlak a, vadungpuihai chu ram ṭâwlah ka siem hlak, tui hrim hrim a um naw leiin a ngahai chu an thuh a, dangchârin an thi hlak."
3,"I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.","Vân khi inthimnain kân thuom hlak a, saiip puon ân khumna dingin ka siem hlak,” tiin."
4,"The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of them that are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as they that are taught.","Mi sâwltak chu thua ka suksâwl- dam theina dingin LALPA Pathien chun inchûktirhai lei a mi pêk a; ama chun tûk tinin a keihar a, inchûk- tirhaiin an hriet anga hre dingin ka na hi a keihar hlak."
5,"The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun ka na a mi sukhawngpêk a, kei chu ka hel nawh a, ka ngha kîr bawk nawh."
6,"I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.","Ka ruongzâng hi vawtuhai kuom- ah ka dawh a, ka bienghai hi hmul phawituhai kuomah ka daw bawk a; muolphonaa le chilsâkkhumnaah ka hmai ka hup nawh."
7,"For the Lord Jehovah will help me; therefore have I not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.","Lalpa PATHIEN chun a mi ṭhangpui ding a ni sih a; chuleiin, kân zak ngai nawh a; chuleiin, meitâwk- lung ang tlatin ka ngha hlak, muol- pho naw ning ti ka hriet."
8,He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand up together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.,"Thiem mîn changtirtu chu a hnai a, tuin am mi do a ta? Ngîr ve vêng ei tih; a mi dotu chu tu am a ni leh? Mi hung hnai raw se."
9,"Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.","Ngai ta, Lalpa PATHIEN chun mi ṭhangpui a tih; tuin am thiemnaw mîn changtir a ta? Ngai ta, chuonghai po po chu silfên angin la hlui a ta, hângthimin fa se vawng a tih."
10,"Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant? he that walketh in darkness, and hath no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.","Nangni laia LALPA chu ṭih a, a siehlaw thuawi chu, tu am a na? Inthima lênga var hrim hrim nei naw chun LALPA hming chu ring sienla, a PATHIEN chungah innghat raw se."
11,"Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.","Mei sêm a, thingthu tivar hlak po pohai, ngai ta u, in mei vara le in thingthu tihai lai chun lêng ro. Hi hi ka kuta inthawka in la hmu ding chu a nih, lungngaitaka in la zâlna ding chu."
