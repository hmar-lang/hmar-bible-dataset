2,"For all these things hath my hand made, and so all these things came to be, saith Jehovah: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.","Hieng thil iengkim hi ka kutin ka siem a ni sih a, chuongchun, hieng thil iengkim hi a hung um tah a nih, LALPAIN a tih; amiruokchu, hi mi rimsitaka um, lungrila insîr ngawi ngawi, ka thua inthin hlaktu tieng hi en lem ka tih."
3,"He that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as he that breaketh a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation, as he that offereth swine’s blood; he that burneth frankincense, as he that blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations:","Bâwngchal thattu chu mihriem thattu ang a na; berâmtea inthâwitu chu ui rîng suktliektu ang a nih; thilpêk inhlântu chu vawk thisen inhlântu ang a nih; beraw rawtu chu milim malsâwmtu ang a nih, anih, anni lampui chu an thlang tah a, an thil tirdakumahai chun an lungril a lâwm hlak."
4,"I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.","Ka ko lai khan tukhawma an mi dawn nawh a, thu ka hril lai khan nain an hriet nawh a, ka mithmua thil suol chu an thaw lem a, ka thil lâwm naw zâwng chu an thlang leiin kei khawmin anni hlêmna ding chu thlangpêk ka ta, an ṭi zâwnghai chu an chungah intlungtir ka tih,” tiin."
5,"Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, have said, Let Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy; but it is they that shall be put to shame.","A thua inthin hlakhai, LALPA thu hi hre ro, “In unau, nangni thei- datu le ka hming leia nangni hnawt suoktuhai cheu chun, ‘In lâwmna kan hmu theina dingin LALPA chu sukro- puiin um raw se,’ an tih a, nisienla- khawm, inzak lem tâng an tih."
6,"A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies.","Ngai ro, khawpuia sa mur mur ri chu! biek ina ri a ni chu! a hmêlmahai thungtu LALPA ri a ni chu!"

8,"Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.",Chuong ang chu tuin am a hriet hlak a? Chuong ang chu tuin am a hmu hlak a? Ni khatah ram a pieng thut dîm a nih? Vawilekhatah hnam a pieng thut dîm a nih? Zion chun nauhase ân vawi phing chun nau chu a nei el ta sih a.

10,"Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her;","“Jerusalem hmangaitu po po- hai, Jerusalem chu hlimpui unla, lâwmpui ro; ama sûntu po pohai, lâwm leiin hlimpui ro;"
11,"that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.","in nêk, a thlamuongna nêneahai chun in tlai theina ding le, in nêk daa, a ropuina tamtaka chun in lâwm theina dingin,” ti hi."
12,"For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and ye shall suck thereof; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.","LALPA chun hieng ang hin a ti sih a, “Ngai ta u, inremna chu va- dungpui ang elin a kuom chenin inluongtir ka ta, hnam tin ropuina chu vadungtê a kuong liem dûl dûl angin a kuom tlungin inluongtir bawk ka tih, chuongchun, chu chu nêng in tih; hmathlâk a ti cheu a, a khûp chunga chun inchâwmtir a ti cheu."

14,"And ye shall see it, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.","Chun, chu chu hmûng in ta, in lungril chu hlim a ta, in ruhai khawm hlohna hring dup angin inno hlut hlut a tih; chuongchun, LALPA kut chu a siehlawhai tieng a um ti hrieng an ta, a hmêlmahai chunga chun lungni naw ni."
15,"For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.","Ngai ta u, a lunginsenna chu hrîkthla ding le, a kâwkna chu mei- chawkhaia hrîkthla dingin, LALPA chu mei leh a hung ding a ni sih a, a tawlailîrhai chu thlivir ang el nîng a tih."

17,"They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, saith Jehovah.","Huonahai chun an feh a, a laia mi hnunga um nghien dinga insuk- thieng le insukfai hlakhai, vawk sa le thil tirdakum le mazu fa chu bohmang tâwl an tih; LALPAIN a tih."

20,"And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an oblation unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.","Israel thlahaiin an thilinhlân chu bûrlebêl inthiengtaka LALPA ina an hung lâklût hlak ang hin, LALPA kuoma thil inhlân dingin hnam tin laia inthawka in unauhai po po chu sakawr chunga dâm, tawlailîra dâm, zâwnnaa dâm, sabengtung lien chi chunga dâm, sanghâwngsei chunga dâm, Jerusalem ka tlâng inthienga chun hung ṭhuoi an tih; LALPAIN a tih."

23,"And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith Jehovah.","Chun, hieng hi hung nîng a ta, thla thara inthawka thla thar dang chenin, châwlnia inthawka châwlni dang chenin mi po po ka hmaa chibai mi bûk dingin hung zut zut an tih, LALPAIN a tih."
24,"And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.","Chun, fe suok hlak an ta, keia chunga bawsetuhai ruok chu en an tih, an ngêhai chu a thiin, an mei chu sukhlumin a um ding a ni si nawh a, mi po po ta dingin thil tirdakumtak nîng a tih”."
