1,"Behold, Jehovah’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:","Ngai ta u, LALPA kut chu san- dam theilo dingin suktawiin a um nawh a, a na chu hre theilo dingin, a sêt bawk nawh:"
2,"but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear.","in khawhlona chu nangni le in Pathien kâra tlain a sukṭhe lem cheu a nih, naa a hriet nuom nawna dingin in suolnahai chun a hmai chu a hlie- pêk bawk cheu a nih."
3,"For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness.","In kuthai chu thisen sukpawr- chein a um a, in kutpârhai hlak khawhlonaa sukpawrchein a um sih a; in hmûrhai chun khêl a hril a, in lei chu rîtlona thu hrilin a chier num num hlak."
4,"None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.","Tukhawma thubuoi indiktakin an hril nawh a, tukhawma indikna leh thubuoi an hril ngai nawh; thu teplo mei mei an ring a, khêl an hril hlak a; thil suksuolna an vawn a, khawhlona an nei hlak."
5,"They hatch adders’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.","Rûlhmuk tuihai an awp kêu a, aium rîl puon an khâwng hlak; an tui fatuhai chu an thi hlak a, sukkawia a uma inthawk chun rûl a hung suok hlak."
6,"Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.","An aium rîl puon chu silfênahai hung inchang naw nih a, an thil- thawhai chun inbel bawk naw ni hai; an thilthawhai chu khawhlona thil- thawhai a na, thil nunsetaka thawna chu an kutah a um bawk a."
7,"Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.","An kehai chu thil ṭha naw tieng a tlân hlak a, pawitâwklo thisen insuo dingin an inhmaw hlak; an ngaituo- hai chu khawhlona ngaituonahai a ni hlak a; râusanna le sietna chu an lampuia chun a um hlak."
8,The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.,Lungmuongna lampui an hriet nawh a; an fenaahai chun indikna hrim hrim a um nawh; an ta dingin lampui kâwihai an siem a; chutaka fe taphawthai chun lungmuongna an hriet ngai nawh.
9,"Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.","Chuleiin, rorêlna chu einia in- thawka hlatakah a um hlak a, felna chun a mi hnawt phâk ngai bawk nawh: var ei nghâk hlak a, nisienla- khawm, ngai ta, inthim a hung ni hlak; varna ei nghâk hlak a, nisienla- khawm, inthim mupa bawk ei fe hlak."
10,"We grope for the wall like the blind; yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men.","Mitdel angin bang ei themmai zut zut hlak a, anih, mit nei nawhai angin ei themmai hlak; thimbut ang elin sûnah ei insui hlak a; mi hrâthai lai chun mithi ang el ei nih."
11,"We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.","Savawmhai angin ei rêngin ei inhûk dur dur hlak a; vaṭhuhai angin nasatakin ei inrûm nghut nghut hlak; rorêlna ei nghâk hlak a, nisienla- khawm, a um dêr si nawh a; sandam- na ei nghâk hlak a, nisienlakhawm, einia inthawka hlatakah a um hlak."
12,"For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:","Kan bawsietnahai hi i hmaah a pung ta sih a; kan suolnahai hin a mi hêk hlak a nih: kan bawsietnahai hi kan kuomah a um zing sih a, kan khawhlonahai chu kan hriet a nih:"
13,"transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.","kan bawsiet dâm, LALPA kan inphatsan dâm, kan Pathien zui pei loa kan nghatsan dâm, nêksâwr thu le hel thu kan hril dâm, khêl thu kan vawng a, lungrila inthawka kan hril suok hlak hi."
14,"And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.","Chuongchun, rorêlna chun hnungtieng a mîn nghatsan a, felna chun hlatakah a mi ngîrsan tah; thutak chu kawtthlêra chun a tlu zing sih a, indikna hlak chu a lût thei nawh a."
15,"Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.","Anih, thutak a um ta nawh a; thil ṭha naw bânsantu chu râllâkah ân siem hlak; LALPAIN chu chu a hmuh a, indikna hrim hrim um ta naw chun a suklungni ta nawh a."
16,"And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.","Chun, mi hrim hrim an um nawh ti a hriet a, hnipêktu hrim hrim an um nawh ti a hriet a, hnipêktu hrim hrim an um naw chu mak a tih a; chuleiin, ama bân ngei chun san- damna ân siempêk a, ama felna ngei chun ama le ama ân chelngîr tah a."
17,"And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.","Chun, felna chu âwmphawah a hâk a, sandamna lukhum a khum a, chun, inthuomnaa chun phubalâkna silfênhai chu ân bel a, zakawfuola chun ṭhahnemngaina a hâk a."
18,"According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.","An thilthawhai angin, an thil- thawhai ang ngeiin, ama chun thung a tih, ama dotuhai chu lunginsen- nain, a hmêlmahai chu thungnain thung a tih; thlierkârhai chu thung- nain thung a tih."
19,"So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth.","Chuongchun, LALPA hming chu thlangtienga inthawkin ṭîng an ta, a ropuina chu nisa suoknaa inthawkin ṭi bawk an tih; ama chu tui lien thut, LALPA thuoka mût luong vut vut angin a hung ding a ni sih a."
20,"And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.","“Chun, Ziona chun intlantu hung a ta, Jakobhai laia bawsietna nghatsantuhai kuoma khawm hung a tih,” LALPAIN a tih."
21,"And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.","“Kei chu hi hi a nih an kuoma ka thuthlung chu: ka thlarau i chunga um le, ka thu i baua ka siehai chun, tuta inthawka chatuon chen khawmin i bau chu suoksan naw ni hai a, i thlahai thla nâwk sâwng bau khawm suoksan bawk naw ni hai,” LALPAIN a tih."
