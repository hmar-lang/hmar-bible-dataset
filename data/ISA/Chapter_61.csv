1,"The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;","Mi rimsihai kuoma chanchin ṭha hril dingin LALPAIN hriek a mi nâl leiin, Lalpa PATHIEN thla- rau chu ka chungah a um a; ama chun, lungril nahai sukdam ding dâm, salhai kuoma suokna thu le mi intânghai kuoma intângna in hawngna ding thu hril ding dâm,"
2,"to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;","LALPA lungawi kum thu le ei Pathien phubalâk ni thu hril ding dâm, lungngaihai po po thlamuon ding dâm,"
3,"to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified.","vut aia pâr ṭhi hrui dâm, lungngai aiah hlimna hriek dâm, nguina thlarau aiah inpâkna silfên dâm an kuomah pea, Ziona lungngaia umhai ta dinga ruotpêk ding dâmin a mi tir a nih; ama chu chawimawia a umna dingin, felna thing, LALPA phunhai ti an ni theina dingin."
4,"And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.","Chun, hmun hlui se tahai chu rem nâwk an ta, kha hmaa khuo râusana lo um tahai chu inngîr ṭha nâwk an ta, khawpui se tah, suon tamtak râusana um ta chu siem ṭha nâwk an tih."
5,"And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.","Ram dang mihai chun in ran ruolhai chu ngîrin intlattir an ta, hriet ngai naw mihai chu in hnuoi inlettuahai le in grêp hrui enkawl- tuahai um an tih."
6,"But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah; men shall call you the ministers of our God: ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.","Nangni ruok chu, “LALPA thiem- puhai,” tia inbûkin um in tih: mihaiin, “Ei Pathien rawngbâwl- tuhai,” tîng an ti cheu a; hnam tin sum fâng in ta, an ropuina chu insuong phâng in tih."
7,Instead of your shame ye shall have double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be unto them.,"An muolpho aiah a let hniin hmûng an ta; an inzak aiah an chanvoah hlimin hla sak an tih: chu- leiin, an rama chun a let hni hluong an ta, kumkhaw hlimna an kuomah um a tih."
8,"For I, Jehovah, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.","Kei LALPA hin rorêlna fel ka ngaina hlak sih a, khawhlotaka inram el hi ka theida hlak a, chuong- chun, anni ka thungna chu titak- meuin an kuomah pêng ka tih, an kuomah kumkhaw thu thlung bawk ka tih."
9,"And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Jehovah hath blessed.","Chuongchun, an thlahai chu hnam tin lai chun hriet nîng an ta, an nauhai chu mi tin laia hriet ni bawk an tih; anni hmu taphawt chun LALPA malsâwm chi an nih ti hrieng an tih."
10,"I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.","LALPAA chun nasatakin hlim ka ta, ka hringna hi ka Pathiena chun lâwmtakin um a tih; mo neitu ding chu pâr ṭhihruia ân chei hlak ang le, mo ding chu ân cheinahaia ân chei hlak ang hin, ama chun sandamna silfênhai a mi bel a, felna zakawfuolin a mi tuom ta sih a."
11,"For as the earth bringeth forth its bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.","Leihnuoi hin a thil indâwn chu ân suoktir hlak ang le, huon hin a sûnga thil chînghai chu ân mâwngtir ang hin, LALPA Pathien chun felna le inpâkna hnam tinrêng hmaa chun ân dertir ding a ni sih a."
