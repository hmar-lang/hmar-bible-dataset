1,"In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;","Assuria lal Sargon tirin Tartan chu Asdod khuoah a hung a, Asdod khuo chu a thawh a, a lâk kum khan;"
2,"at that time Jehovah spake by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put thy shoe from off thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.","chu lai chun LALPAIN Amoz naupa Isai bauin, “Fe la, i kâwnga saiip puon kha hlîp la, i kea kekawk kha sie rawh,” tiin a hril a. Chuong- chun, chuong ang chun a thawh a, saruok le kekawk bun loin a fe a fe tah a."
3,"And Jehovah said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia;","Chun, LALPA chun, “Ka siehlaw Isai hi Aigupta mihai chunga le Ethiopia mihai chunga thilmak le inchiknaa dingin kum thum sûnga saruok le kekawk bun loa a fe ang hin,"
4,"so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.","Assuria lal chun Aiguptahai manhai le Ethiopiahai salhai chu, a nuhmei a pasalin, saruok le kekawk bun lo le mawng inlangin Aiguptahai muolphona dingin ṭhuoi hmang a tih."
5,"And they shall be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.","Chuongchun, an beisei tak Ethiopia le an ropuina tak Aigupta mihai lei chun lunginzîngtak le muolphotakin um tâng an tih."
6,"And the inhabitant of this coast-land shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and we, how shall we escape?","Chuongchun, chu nia chun hi tuisuoriet panga mi hin, ‘Ngai ta, ka beiseitak, Assuria lala inthawka mi sanhim dinga mi ṭhangpuitu dinga ei tlânna chu, hieng hi a ni ta sih a, eini hi iengtin am tlân suok ei ta?’ la tîng an tih,” a ta."
