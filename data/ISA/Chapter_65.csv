1,"I am inquired of by them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.","A mi lam ngai nawhai zawngin ka um a, a mi zawng ngai nawhai hmuin ka um a; ka hming put naw hnam kuoma chun, “Hitaka hin ka um, hitaka hin ka um,” ka tih a."
2,"I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;","Mi hel hmanghai ta dingin sûnnithlâkin ka bânhai ka phar hlak, chuonghai chu anni ngaituona ang peia lampui ṭha nawa fe hlakhai,"
3,"a people that provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;","huonahai inthâwia, ṭêklei chung- ahai thil rim inhnik rawha, ka hmaisan ngeia mi suklungsen hlak- tuhai,"
4,"that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;","thlân laiahai ṭhunga, hmun fien- rielhaia riek hlakhai, vawk sa faa, an bêlhaia thil tirdakumhai tuihâng um hlakhai,"
5,"that say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.","“Nanga khât chauin ngîr rawh, mi hung hnai naw, nanga nêk chun kân thieng lem hi,” ti hlaktuhai chu an nih; chuonghai chu ka hnâra meikhu um, sûnnithlâka mei hring zing hlak chu a nih."
6,"Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom,","Ngai ta u, ka hmaah ziekin a um a, to zing naw ningah a, thung lem ka tih, anih, an ângsûngah thung ve vêng ka tih,"
7,"your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.","nangni khawhlona le in puhai khawhlona chu, LALPAIN a tih, chuonghai chun tlâng lien chungahai thil rim inhnik an rawh a, tlâng chungahai chun ka hming an hrilsiet hlak; chuleiin, an sinthaw chu a hmasatakin an ângsûngah inkhipêk ka tih."
8,"Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all.","LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, “Grêp bâwrah uoin thar an hmuh a, miin, ‘Sukse naw, khataka khan malsâwmna a um si,’ an ti ang khan, ka siehlawhai leiin ti vêng ka tih, an rênga ka suksiet vawng nawna dingin."
9,"And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.","Chun, Jakoba inthawkin chi pa- khat suksuok ka ta, Judaa inthawkin ka tlânghai hluotu ding chu suksuok bawk ka tih; chuongchun, ka mi thlanghai chun chu chu hluong an ta, ka siehlawhai chu chutaka chun um an tih."
10,"And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.","Ka mi, a mi zawngtuhai ta ding chun, Saron chu berâm ruolhai huon nîng a ta, Akor ruom chu bâwng ruolhai bawkna hmun ding nîng a tih."
11,"But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny;","Nisienlakhawm, nangni LALPA mâksana, ka tlâng inthieng thei- nghila, Vângneina Siemtu ta dinga dawkân buotsaia, Chantâwka Khaw- rêltunu dinga uoin chawkpawl sa suksip hlaktuhai;"
12,"I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.","ka ko lai cheu khan in mi dawn nuom nawh a, thu ka hril lai khan nain in hriet nuom nawh a, ka mithmuah thil suol chu in thaw lema, ka thil lâwm naw zâwng chu in thlang leiin kâwlhnâmin in chantâwk chu rêlpêk ka ti cheu a, in rêngin thatnaa chun kûn vawng in tih."
13,"Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame;","Chuleiin, LALPA Pathien chun hieng ang hin a tih, “Ngai ta u, ka siehlawhai chun fâng an ta, nangni ruok chu phîngṭâmin um in tih: ngai ta u, ka siehlawhai chun dâwn an ta, nangni ruok chu dangchârin um in tih; ngai ta u, ka siehlawhai chu hlim an ta, nangni ruok chu inzak in tih:"
14,"behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.","ngai ta u, ka siehlawhai chu lungrila an lâwm leiin hlimtakin hla sak an ta, nangni ruok chu lungrila in lungngai leiin ṭap in tih, thla- raua in lungngai leiin khêk rak rak in tih."
15,And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay thee; and he will call his servants by another name:,"Chun, in hming chu ṭawng inkhâmna dingin ka mi thlanghai kuoma chun mâksan in ta, Lalpa PATHIEN chun sukhlum a ti cheu a, chun, a siehlawhai chu hming dangin ko tâng a tih;"
16,"so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.","chuongchun, hnuoia hin mâni le mâni mal insâwm fâwmtu chu thutak Pathiena chun mal insâwm a ta; hnuoia hin ṭawng inkhâmtu chu thutak Pathien sâlin ṭawng inkhâm a tih; kha hmaa lunginzîngnahai chu theinghila a um ta leiin le ka mita inthawka thupa a um ta leiin."
17,"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.","Ngai ta u, vân tharhai le hnuoi thar ka siem a ni hi; kha hmaa thilhai chu hriet zingin um ta naw nih a; lungrila khawm lût ta bawk naw ni."
18,"But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.","Nisienlakhawm, ka thil siema chun kumkhuoin lâwmin hlim ro; ngai ta u, Jerusalem chu hlimnaah ka siem a, a mihai chu lâwmnaah ka siem a ni hi."
19,"And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.","Jerusalem chunga chun hlim ka ta, ka mihai chunga khawm lâwm ka tih; a sûnga chun ṭap ri chu hriet ni ta naw nih a, inrûm ri khawm hriet ni ta naw ni;."
20,"There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.","Chutaka inthawka suok chu nautê ni sâwt nawtê dam um naw ni hai a, putar a dam sûng nihai tlingtla naw um bawk naw ni hai: naupang chu kum za mi niin a thi ding a ni sih a, mi suol kum za chau dam chu ṭawngsephur a ni ding a nih."
21,"And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.","Chun, inhai bâwl an ta, chuong- a chun um zing bawk an tih; grêp huonhai siem an ta, a ra fa bawk an tih."
22,"They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.","Mi dang umna dingin in bâwl ta naw ni hai a, mi dang fâk dingin grêp huon siem nâwk ta bawk naw ni hai; thing dam sûng nihai ang hin ka mihai dam sûng nihai chu a um ding a ni sih a, ka mi thlanghai chu sâwttak an thawsuok chunga chun an lâwm ding a nih."
23,"They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.","A thlâwnin sin inrim naw ni hai a, vângduoina el dingin nau nei bawk naw ni hai a, LALPA malsâwm mi thlahai an ni sih a, an nauhai chu an kuomah um zing an tih."
24,"And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.","Chun, hieng hi hung nîng a ta, annin an mi ko hma khawmin dawn ka ta; thu an la hril lai zing khawmin ka nain hrieng ka tih."
25,"The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah.","Satene le berâmte chu tla hmunkhat tâng an ta, sakeibaknei chun bâwngchal angin bupâwl fa tâng a tih; pilvut chu rûl bu ni bawk a tih. Ka tlâng inthienga hrim hrim chun sukna ta naw ni hai a, sukse ta bawk naw ni hai, LALPAIN a tih."
