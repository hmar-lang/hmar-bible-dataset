1,"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.","“Inringtakin khêk rawh, in- dawi naw rawh, tawtawrâwt angin i râwl insuo tuor tuor la, ka mihai kuomah an bawsietna chu hril la, Jakob sûnghai kuoma chun an suolnahai chu hril bawk rawh."
2,"Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.","Anni chun zawng chu ni tin el an mi zawng hlak a, ka lampui thuhai hriet chu an inhâwk hlak; feltaka thaw le an Pathien rorêlna bânsan ngai naw hnam angin, ka kuomah rorêlna feltak an mi hni hlak a. Pathien hung hnai khawm an inhâwk hlak a nih."
3,"Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find your own pleasure, and exact all your labors.","‘Ieng leiin am bu kan nghei a i hriet si naw a, ieng leiin am kan insukrimsih a i hriet si naw maw?’ an ti hlak a. Ngai ta u, in bu nghei ni chun nangni nunkhuo in phâm a, in sinthawtuhai po po in nêksâwr hlak."
4,"Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.","Ngai ta u, innghirnghona le in- sêlna ding el, rîtlona kuttuma inchum dingin a nih, bu in nghei hlak chu: in râwl hi chungtienga inhriettir tlâk zâwngin chu ni chun bu in nghei ngai nawh."
5,"Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?","Chuong ang chu bu ngheina ka dit zâwng chûm a nih? Thielkuong anga a lu kûn ding le, a hnuoia saiip puon phaa vut phul ding am a nih? Chu chu bu ngheina le LALPA ta dinga ni lâwmtlâk i ti ding am a nih?"
6,"Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?","“Hi hi ni lo am a ni bungheina ka idit zâwng chu? Rîtlonaa khuop sût- pêk le, rîngkawl hruihai sûtpêk le, nêksâwra umhai insuoktir le, rîng- kawl tinrêng suktliekpêk hi."
7,"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?","Mâni bu mi phîngṭâmhai kuoma sem le, rimsi hnawtsuoka umhai mâni ina ṭhuoi hi ni lem lo am a nih? Mi saruok hmua puona dêng le, mâni tisa ang put mihaia inthawka inbîk- hmang naw hi ni lem lo am a nih?"
8,"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall be thy rearward.","“Chu pha chun i var chu zîng nisa suok angin hung suok a ta, i damna ding chu hung inder suok vak a tih; i felna chun i hma ṭhuoi a ta; LALPA ropuina chu i hnung dâltu nîng a tih."
9,"Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;","Chu pha chun ko i ta, chuong- chun, LALPA chun dawn a tih; hang ko i ta, chuongchun, ama chun, ‘Hitaka hin ka um,’ tîng a tih. Nangni laia inthawka rîngkawl dâm, kut- chala mi khîk dâm, suoltaka ṭawng- hai hi i sukbo a,"
10,"and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday;","phîngṭâmhai kuoma i dit zâwng pe a, sukrinuma umhai i suktlai bawk chun, i var chu inthim lai chun var suok a ta, în thimna chu sûn ang el ni tâng a tih."
11,"and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.","Chun, LALPA chun ṭhuoi rawp a ti cheh a, hmun ṭâwla khawm sukkhawp a ti che a, i ruhai khawm sukhrât bawk a tih; chun, huon tuia châwm ang le, tuihnâr kang ngai lo ang ni tâng i tih."
12,"And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.","Chuongchun, nangmaa in- thawka la hung insieng dinghai chun hmun hlui se ta hnunghai chu rem nâwk an ta, suon tamtak lungphûm chu hung rem nâwk i tih, chuong- chun, nang chu, ‘A sietna lai siem ṭhatu,’ ‘Mi umna dinga lampuihai siem ṭhatu,’ tîng an ti che."
13,"If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:","“Châwlni bawse lo dinga, ka ni inthienga i nuom zâwng thaw lo dinga i kepha chu în nghatkîrtir a, châwlni chu ni lâwmum le LALPA ni inthieng chu inzaum i tih a, mâni lampui hraw loa, i chawimawi chun,"
14,then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.,"LALPA chunga chun lâwm i ta, leihnuoi hmun insângahai chun inchuongtir ka ti cheh a; i pu Jakob rohluo thilin châwm ka ti che; LALPA bau chun chu chu a hril tah a nih.”"
