21,"Declare ye, and bring it forth; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath showed this from ancient time? who hath declared it of old? have not I, Jehovah? and there is no God else besides me, a just God and a Saviour; there is none besides me.","Hril unla, hung suksuok ro, anih, inrâwn tâwl raw hai se; inhmaa inthawk tah tuin am ân hriettir a? Tienlaia inthawk tah tuin am a hril a? Kei LALPA hin ka thaw a ni naw am a nih? Keima naw chu Pathien dang hrim an um nawh. Keima naw chu a dang hrim an um nawh; Pathien fel le sandamtu ka nih."
22,"Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.","Kâwlkawdawnga mi po pohai, keia tieng hung ngha unla, sandamin um ro; kei hi Pathien ka ni sih a, a dang hrim hrim an um nawh."
23,"By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.","‘Khûp tinrêng chu ka hmaah dingṭhaṭhuon tâng an ta, lei tinrêng khawmin ṭawng inkhâmin thu tiem tâng an tih,’ tiin mâni le mâni insâlin ṭawng kân khâm tah; thu chu felna ruokin ka baua inthawkin a suok tah a, hung kîr nâwk ta naw nih."
24,"Only in Jehovah, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength; even to him shall men come; and all they that were incensed against him shall be put to shame.","Miin, ‘LALPAA chau felna le hrâtna a um,’ tiin, ka chungthu la hril an tih; ama kuoma mi ngei hung an ta, a chunga lungninawhai po po chu muolphotakin um tâng an tih."
