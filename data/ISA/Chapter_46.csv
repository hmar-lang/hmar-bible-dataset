6,"Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; they fall down, yea, they worship.","Mansaa inthawka rângkachak bun suok hlak a, tangka bûknaa bûk hlakhai chun rângkachak suttu an ruoi a, ama chun pathienah a siem hlak a; chuongchun, an bawkkhup a, anih, chibai an bûk hlak."
7,"They bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it standeth, from its place shall it not remove: yea, one may cry unto it, yet can it not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.","An liengkoah an put a, an fepui a, a hmun dinga chun an sie hlak a, a ngîr ta zing a, a umnaa inthawk chun insawn ta naw nih: anih, miin ama chu ko an ta, nisienlakhawm, dawn thei si naw ni a, an lunginzîngnaa inthawkin sansuok thei chuong naw ni."

11,"calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.","khawsak tienga inthawkin vate hnukinrâwltak, ram hlataka in- thawka ka mi ruot chu ka ko a, anih, ka hril tah a, muolsuo bawk ka tih; ka tum tah a, thaw bawk ka tih."
