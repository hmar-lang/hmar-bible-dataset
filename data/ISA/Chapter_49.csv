1,"Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye peoples, from far: Jehovah hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name:","Aw thlierkârhai, ka thu ngai unla, hlataka mi tinhai, lo ngai bawk ro; LALPA chun sula inthawk hrimin a mi ko a; ka nu phîng sûnga inthawk hrimin ka hming a lo hril tah a;"
2,and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me: and he hath made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he kept me close:,"ka bau hi kâwlhnâm ngeitak angin a siem a, a kuta chun a mi thuphmang a, thal nâwt tle varah a mi siem a, a thal bâwma chun a mi khum tlat a;"

5,"And now saith Jehovah that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered unto him (for I am honorable in the eyes of Jehovah, and my God is become my strength);","Tuhin chu LALPA, Jakobhai a kuoma ṭhuoi nâwkna ding le, Israel- hai a kuoma ṭhuoi khâwma an umna dingin siehlawa um dinga sula inthawka mi thlangtu chun a hril a, (LALPA mithmu chun mi inzaum ka ni sih a, ka Pathien chu ka hrâtna a ni ta bawk a) anih,"
6,"yea, he saith, It is too light a thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.","ama chun, “Jakobhai hnam tung- dingna ding le Israelhai laia hum- hima umhai chu inumtir nâwkna dinga, ka siehlawa i um hi, thil chiterek a la na; Jentailhai sukvartua khawm ruot bawk ka ti che; kâwl- kawdawng chena ka sandamna chu a tlung theina dingin,” a ta."
7,"Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall worship; because of Jehovah that is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.","LALPA Israelhai intlantu le an Mi Inthieng chun, nasataka hmusita um le hnamhai iten, rorêltuhai sie- hlaw kuoma chun hieng ang hin a hril, “LALPA ringum, Israelhai Mi Inthieng, nangma thlangtu lei khan lalhaiin hmûng an ta, tho an tih; mi lienhai khawma chibai bûk an tih,” tiin."
8,"Thus saith Jehovah, In an acceptable time have I answered thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages;","LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, “Hun lâwmumah ka dawn cheh a, sandamna niah ka ṭhangpui che; ram inngîr ding le rochan ram râusan ta hnunghai annirawi chu inhluotir dingin ka humhim chein, mihai thuthlung dingin ka ruot che:"
