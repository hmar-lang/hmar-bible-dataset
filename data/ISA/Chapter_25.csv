1,"O Jehovah, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.","Aw LALPA, nang chu ka Pathien i na; chawimawi ka ti cheh a, i hming inpâk ka tih; thil maktak, inhmaa remruothai chu, ringumtak le thutakin i thaw sih a."
2,"For thou hast made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.",Khawpui khawm hnuoi pâwngah în changtir a; khuo kulpui nei khawm khaw ṭawpah în changtir a; ram dang mihai lal in khawm bâwlin um nâwk ta naw nih.
3,Therefore shall a strong people glorify thee; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee.,"Chuleiin, mi hrâttakhai chun chawimawi an ti cheh a, hnam ṭium- tak khawpuihai chun ṭîng an ti che."
4,"For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.","Mi ṭiumhai thuok chu thlipuiin bang a nam sawk sawk anga a hung um lai hin, nang chu mi rimsihai ta dingin kulbîng, pasie lunginzîng laia dinga kulbîng, thlipuia inthawka inhumhimna, nisa sat hlietu i ni hlak sih a."
5,"As the heat in a dry place wilt thou bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low.","Hmun ṭâwla khaw lum chu i sukre hlak ang hin ram dang mihai ri chu sukbo i tih, khaw lum chu sûm hlieha sukboa a um hlak ang hin, mi ṭiumhai hla sak chu sukboin um a tih."
6,"And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.","Chun, hi tlânga hin sipaihai LALPA chun mi tinrênghai ta dingin thil thauhaiin ruoi ṭhêng a tih, uoin- hai a fe le inchie zing, thil thautakhai thlina sip, uoinhai a fe le inchie zing ṭhataka thlit fai chu."
7,"And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.","Chun, mi tinrêng an inkhumna le, hnam tinrêng an inkhumna chu, hi tlânga hin suksieng a tih."
8,He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken it.,Thina chu a lem sawng tah; Lalpa PATHIEN chun mi po po hmaia inthawk chu mitthlihai chu hrufai a tih; a mihai hming sietna chu leihnuoi po po chunga inthawk hin la hmang a tih; LALPAIN chu chu a hril ta sih a.
9,"And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.","Chun, chu nia chun, “Ngai ta u, hi hi ei Pathien a ni hi, ama hi ei nghâk zing a; chuongchun, ama chun mi sandam a tih: hi hi LALPA chu a ni hi; ama hi ei nghâk zing a, a san- damnaa chun hlimin lâwm ei tih,” tîng an tih."
10,"For in this mountain will the hand of Jehovah rest; and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.","Hi tlânga hin LALPA kut chu innghat a ta. Moab chu, bupâwl chu êkthlia sirdea a um hlak ang hin, ama hmunah sirdein a um ding a ni sih a."
11,"And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim; but Jehovah will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.","Chuongchun, tui inhlieuin tui inhlieu dinga a vai ang hin, chu lai chun a kut chu vai a tih; chun, a chapona chu a kut vervêk pum chun LALPA chun sie hnuoi a tih."
12,"And the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.","Chun, i kul banghai, in insâng kulpui chu sukchimin, sie hnuoiin, hnuoiah, pilvut tlung khawp rakin sukthlûng a tih."
