5,"ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?","Nangni thingsaisuo laia, thing buk hnuoi tina insukthafâna, ruom sûnghaia lung kak bula dâm naupang thattuhai."
6,"Among the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?","Vadung ruom lung innâm lai chun i chanvo a um a; chuong, chuonghai ngei chu; i chanpuol chu a nih, chuonghai ta ding ngei chun thil inhlân dâwn mi i buok a, thilpêk khawm în hlân kha.

8,"And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast uncovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them: thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.","Kawtkhârhai le kawtkhâr bieng phênahai chun i hriet zingnahai chu în tung a, keia kuomah ni loin, mi dang kuomah în hlîp a, i hang fe sih a; i khum i zau a, an kuomah thu i thlung a; an khum chu i hmûnaa chun i hmangai a, an saruokna chu i en a."
9,"And thou wentest to the king with oil, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol.","Chun, hriek leh lal kuomah i feh a, i riminhnikhai chu i thaw nasa zuol a, i palaihai chu hlatakah i tir a, Seol tlung rakin în sukhnuoi kha."
10,"Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, It is in vain: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint.","I fena lampui hlat leiin i sâwl a, nisienlakhawm, “Beiseina hrim hrim a um nawh,” i ti si nawh a; i hrâtna sukharna i hmuh a; chuleiin, i châu ta naw kha."
11,"And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and thou fearest me not?","Tu am i ṭih a, în lau a, khêl i hril hlak a, kei i mi hriet ta nawh a, i lungrila i ngaituo ta naw hi?

13,"When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that taketh refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.","I khêk pha chun i lâk khâwmhai chun sanhim raw se che; nisien- lakhawm, anni rawi chu thliin lâng a ta, thuokin lên hmang vawng a tih; kei mi ringtu ruok chun ram hi nei a ta, ka tlâng inthieng hi hluong a tih."
14,"And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.","Chun, ama chun, “Sung pâwng ro, sung pâwng ro, lampui buotsai ro, ka mihai lampuia an tlûkna ding chu pei ro,” tîng a tih."
15,"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.","Mi chunghnung, chawisâng, chatuona um, a hming inthieng chun hieng ang hin a ti sih a; “Kei hmun chunghnung le inthiengah ka um a, mi thuhnuoirawlhai lungril sukhar ding le insîr ngawi ngawihai lungril sukhar dingin mi lungrila insîr ngawi ngawia thuhnuoirawltak kuoma khawm ka um a nih."

17,"For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid my face and was wroth; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.","A duâm khawhlona leiin ka lunginsen a, ka vuok a, ka hmai ka hip a, ka lung a sen a nih; ama hlak chu a lungril um dân pângngaihaiah kâwmâwtakin a um pei a."
18,"I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.","A um dânhai chu ka hmuh a, ama chu sukdam ka tih; ṭhuoi bawk ka ta, ama le a sûnpuituhai kuomah lungmuongnahai pe nâwk ka tih."
19,"I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith Jehovah; and I will heal him.","Kei chun hmûrhai ra ka siem hlak a, ‘Inremna, inremna, hlataka um kuoma le hnaitaka um kuoma chun um raw se,’ LALPAIN a tih, ama chu sukdam ka tih."
20,"But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.","Mi rilohai ruok chu tuisuoriet fâwn fâwn hlakhai ang chu an na; an um ṭawk ṭawk thei si nawh a, a tuihai chun hmunhnawk le chirhak a vawr suok hlak,” tiin."
21,"There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.","Ka Pathien chun, “Mi rilohai ta ding chun lungmuongna hrim hrim a um nawh,” a tih."
