2,"then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel.","chu pha chun Ariel hi suklung- zîng ka ta; chuongchun, sûnna le ṭapna um a tih; chun, ama chu ka ta dingin Ariel ang chu nîng a tih."
3,"And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee.","Chun, nang chu thaw tumin i vêla chun ep ka ti cheh a, kul siemin inhuol vêl bawk ka ti cheh a, thaw ding chein inhuol vêlna kulbînghai siem bawk ka tih."
4,"And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.","Chuongchun, sukthlûkin um i ta, hnuoi hnuoia inthawkin thu hril i ta; i ṭawng chu pilvut lai chun damtein inri suok a tih: i râwl chu khawhri aisânthiem râwl ri ang chauin hnuoi hnuoia inthawk chun hung suok a tih; i ṭawng chu pilvut laia inthawk chun hung suok sê sêng a tih."
5,"But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.","Nisienlakhawm, nanga dotu mipuihai chu pilvut inditak angin um an ta, mi ṭiumhai mipuihai chu busi bohmang hlak ang hin um bawk an tih; anih, chu chu mitkhapkâr loin um thut a tih."
6,"She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.","Vâninrûm dâm, simkhawleihnuoi inhnîng dâm, ri nasatak dâm, thlivir dâm, thlipui dâm, thil kâng hmang thei meichawk dâmin ama chu sipaihai LALPA hremin um a tih."
7,"And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.","Chuongchun, Ariel dotu hnam po po mipuihai, ama le a kulbîng thaw- tuhai po po leh ama suklungzîng- tuhai po po chu mang ang chau nîng an ta, zâna inlâr ang chau el hi."
8,"And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.","Mi phîngṭâmin mang a nei chun bu a lo fâk hlak a; nisienlakhawm, a hang har a, a phîng chu a lo la ruok zing ang hi nîng a tih; annawleh, mi dangchârin mang a nei chun tui a lo dâwn hlak a, nisienlakhawm, a hung har a, a lo la châu zingin, tui a la du rawp ang hi nîng a tih; Zion tlâng thawtu hnam po po mipuihai chu, chuong ang chu an ni ding a nih."
9,"Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.","Ngîr zing unla, makti ro, nuom- tâwl unla, mitdelin um ro; an inrui a, nisienlakhawm, uoin lei a ni nawh; an pêm an pêm a, nisienlakhawm, zu lei a ni nawh."
10,"For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered.","LALPA chun îmu hêna thlarau chu in chungah a buok a, in mit, zâwlneihai chu, ân sîmtir a; in lu, hmutheituhai chu, ân khum ta sih a."
11,"And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed:","Chuongchun, inlârna hrim hrim in ta dingin lekhabu châr tlata thu ang a ni tah a, chu chu mihaiin lekha thiem mi kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin hi hi tiem rawh,” tiin an pêk hlak a; chun, ama chun, “Ka tiem thei nawh, châr tlat a ni hi,” a ti hlak;"
12,"and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.","chun, lekhabu chu lekha thiem naw mi kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin hi hi tiem rawh,” tiin a pêk hlak a; chun, ama chun, “Lekha ka thiem nawh,” a ti hlak."
13,"And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh unto me, and with their mouth and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught them;","Chun, LALPA chun, “Hieng mihai hin an mi hung hnai a, an bau le an hmûr hin an mi chawimawi hlak deha chu, an lungril chu keia hlatah an sawn hlak a, an mi ṭina chu mihriemhai thupêk miin an inchûktir el chu a nih;"
14,"therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.","chuleiin, ngai ta, hienghai lai hin thilmak thaw nâwk nghâl ka ta, thilmak, thilmaktak el chu; chuong- chun, an mi varhai varna chu bohmang tâng a tih, an mi bengvârhai hrietna chu thupin um tâng a tih,” a ta."
15,"Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?","An remruot chu LALPA kuoma thup dinga inthûktaka zawngtuhai chu an chung a rik ie! an thilthawhai chu inthim hnuoiah a um a, “Tuin am mi hmûng a ta? Tuin am hriet khawm mi hrieng a ta?” an ta."
16,"Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?","Thilhai hi in suklinglet vawng hlak de aw! Bêlhemtu chu bepil ang chaua ngaiin a um ding am a nih? Thilsiem chun a siemtu chu, “Ama mi siem ka ni hlak lêm” a ti el chu? annawleh, thil inngîra um chun ân ngîrtu chu, “Hrietna hrim a nei nawh,” ti am a ni leh?"
17,"Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?","Sâwt nawte hnungah ni lo am a ni, Lebanon chu hnuoi ṭhatak hmuna inchangtira uma, hnuoi ṭhatak hmun chu ramhnuoia ngaia a um ding chu?"
18,"And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.","Chu nia chun nasêthai chun lekhabu thu chu nain hre tâng an ta, mitdelhai mithai chun inthim hnuoi le inthim laia inthawkin hmu tâng an tih."
19,"The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.","Thuhnuoirawlhai khawmin LALPAA chun an hlimna chu sukpung tâng an ta, mihriem laia rimsihai chu Israelhai Mi Inthienga chun lâwm tâng an tih."
20,"For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;","Mi ṭium chu iengkhawm ni loa siemin um tâng a ta, hmusittu chu a bo tah a, khawhlona nghâkhlatuhai po po chu sukbohmangin an um ta sih a,"
21,"that make a man an offender in his cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.","chuonghai chun mi chu thupawi thuah suksuoltuah an siem hlak a, kul kawtkhârah kâwktu âwkna ding- in châng an kam hlak a, mi fel chu thil teplo mei meiin an inkhêltir hlak."
22,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.","Chuleiin, LALPA, Abraham in- tlantu chun, Jakob sûnghai chung- châng thuah hieng ang hin a tih, “Jakobhai chu tuhin chu muolpho ta naw ni hai a, an hmai chu dâng ta bawk naw ni."
23,"But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.","An nau, ka kutsuokhai chu, anni laia an hmu chun, ka hming chu sukthieng lem tâng an tih; anih, Jakobhai Mi Inthieng chu sukthieng an ta, Israelhai Pathien chu ṭi tâng an tih."
24,"They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction.","Thlaraua invâkhmanghai khawm chun hrethiem tâng an ta, mi chierhai chun thuinchûktir chu in- chûktir tâng an tih,” tiin."
