1,"Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Jehovah, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness","Aw Jakob sûng, Israel hming inṭâwmpuia, Juda tuihaia inthawk suok a, thutakah ni si loa, felnaa khawm ni bawk si lo, LALPA hming sâla ṭawng inkhâma, Israelhai Pathien hming lam hlaktuhai, hi hi lo ngai ro."
2,"(for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; Jehovah of hosts is his name):","(Khawpui inthienga mi an inti si hlak a, Israelhai Pathien chungah ringna an innghat bawk a nih; a hming chu sipaihai LALPA a nih)."
3,"I have declared the former things from of old; yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.","Kha hma thilhai chu tiena tlângah ka lo hril tah a, anih, ka baua inthawkin a suok a, kân hriettir a; kârloin ka muolsuo thut a, a hung tlung tah a."
4,"Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;","Mi kâwmaw in na, in rîng chu thîr tha a na, in chal chu dâr a ni ka hriet leiin,"
5,"therefore I have declared it to thee from of old; before it came to pass I showed it thee; lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.","tienlaia inthawkin in kuomah ka hril a, a hung tlung hma khawma in kuomah kân hriettir cheu kha; chuong naw chun, “Ka milim chun a ti a nih, ka milim siem fâwm le ka milim sung chun thu a pêk a nih,” ti rawi in tih."
6,"Thou hast heard it; behold all this; and ye, will ye not declare it? I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known.","In hriet de kha; hieng po po hi en ro; nangnîn in hril ding a ni lem ta naw am a nih? Tuta chen chu thil thar inhriettir tâng ka ti cheu, thil inthup in hriet ngai nawhai chu."
7,"They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.","Chuong chun inhmaa siem ni loin, tuta siem a nih; vawisûn ni hma khan chu in na khawma in hriet ngai nawh; chuong naw chun, “Ngai ta, chuong chu kan hriet zing annâwm,” ti rawi in tih."
8,"Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou didst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.","Anih, in nain in hriet ngai nawh a; anih, in lungrilin in hriet ngai bawk nawh; anih, inhma hrim hrim khan in na chu hawngin a um ngai nawh; vervêktak takin in thaw hlak ti le, sula inthawk hrimin bawsetuhai an ti hlak cheu ka hriet sih a."
9,"For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.","Ka sukbohmang nawna ding cheuin, ka hming leiin ka lunginsen chu khêk hrîng ka ta, inpâk ka hlawna dingin in chungah insûm ka tih."
10,"Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.","Ngai ta u, ka sukthieng cheu a na, nisienlakhawm, tangka suk- thieng ang chun a ni nawh; rinumna raw tuina meia chun ka fie cheu a nih."
11,"For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do it; for how should my name be profaned? and my glory will I not give to another.","Keima le keima leiin, anih, keima le keima lei ngawtin a nih ka thaw ding chu; ka hming hi ieng dingin am suksietin um a ta? Ka ropuina hi mi dang kuomah pe naw ning ah."
12,"Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.","Aw Jakobhai le ka ko Israelhai, ka thu hi ngai ro; kei hi ama chu ka nih; a hmasa tak chu ka na, a nu- hnung tak khawm ka nih."
13,"Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.","Anih, ka kut hin leihnuoi innghatsan chu a phûm a, ka kut changtieng hin vânhai khi a keiphar a; ka ko phingleh an ngîr khâwm hlak."
14,"Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; who among them hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah loveth shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.","Nangni rawi po pohai, inkhâwm unla, ngai ro; anni lai chun tuin am hieng thil hi a hril hlak a? LALPA chun ama chu a hmangai a, ama chun Babulon chunga chun a dit zâwng thâwng a ta, a bân chu Kaldaihai chungah inletin um a tih."
15,"I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.","Kei, keima ngei hin thu ka hril tah a; anih, ama chu ka ko a, ka ṭhuoi a, a lampui chu suktluong pei ka tih."
16,"Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit.","Nangnirawi hin mi hung hnai unla, lo ngai ro; a tira inthawk khan arûkin thu ka hril ngai nawh a; a um tîr laia inthawk khan chutaka chun ka um a; tuhin LALPA Pathien chun keima le a thlarau chu a mi tir tah a."
17,"Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.","LALPA, nangni intlantu, Israel- hai Mi Inthieng chun hieng ang hin a tih, “Kei hi LALPA in Pathien, in ṭhatna dinga nangni inchûktirtu, in fena lampuia ṭhuoitu ding cheu chu ka nih."
18,"Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:","Aw nangni hin ka thupêkhai chu lo ngai chu ni unla chu aw! In chungah inremna chu vadung ang ela umin, in felna chu tuisuoriet fâwnhai ang elin a um ding bah;"
19,"thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.","in thlahai khawm ṭieu phaiphin zâta umin, in rîla rahai khawm ṭieu pilvut mal tê tê zât rauin an um ding bah: an hming chu ka hmaa inthawka thaihmangin um naw nih a, sukbo- hmangin um bawk naw ni,” tiin."
20,"Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob.","Babulona inthawkin suok unla, Kaldaihai chu tlân hmangsan ro, hi hi hla sak riin inhriettir unla, hril unla kâwlkawdawng chen khawma sukri ro, “LALPA chun a siehlaw Jakobhai chu ân tlan tah,” ti ro."
21,"And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.","Thlalêrahai chun a ṭhuoi lai khan an dang a châr nawh a; lung- puia inthawk chun an ta dingin tuihai ân luong suoktir a; lungpui chu a sukkawi a, chuongchun, tuihai chu a hung suok ta zur zur a."
22,"There is no peace, saith Jehovah, to the wicked.","LALPA chun, “Mi rilohai ta ding chun muongna hrim hrim a um nawh,” a tih."
