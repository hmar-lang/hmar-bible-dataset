10,"For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.","Tlâng lienhai chu fe hmang an ta, tlâng chînhai chu sawnin um bawk an tih; ka zainêmna ruok hi chu i kuoma inthawkin fe hmang naw nih a, ka remna thuthlung chu sawnin um bawk naw ni, LALPA a lungin- siettu che chun a tih."
