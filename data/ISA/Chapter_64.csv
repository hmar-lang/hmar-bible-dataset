1,"Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,",Tlânghai chu i hmaa an luong thlâk dûl dûl theina dingin vân kha sukthlêrin hung ṭum thei hrâm la chu aw!
2,"as when fire kindleth the brushwood, and the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!","meiin thing nawi a suk chawk a, tui dâm a sukso ang hin, hnam tin i hmaah an inthin a, nangma dotuhai che kuoma chun i hming chu in- hriettir a ni theina dingin."
3,"When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.","Kan beisei naw thil râpthlâk i thaw lai khan i hung ṭum a, tlânghai chu i hmaah an luong thlâk dûl dûl kha."
4,"For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him.","Tienlaia inthawk tah mihaiin, nangma chau naw chu, anni nghâktuhai ta ding thawpêk hlaktu Pathien an hriet ngai si nawh a, nain an hriet ngai nawh a, mit khawma an hmu ngai bawk nawh."
5,"Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them have we been of long time; and shall we be saved?","Nang chun hlimtaka uma, fel- taka thawtu, i lampuihaia nangma hre zing hlaktuhai chu, i tuok hlak a; ngai ta, nang i lunginsen a, keinin thil kan suksuol a; chuongahai chun sâwttak kan lo um tah a, chuong- chun, sandamin la um thei kan ti?"
6,"For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.","Mi inthieng naw angin kan lo um vawng ta sih a, kan felnahai po po khawm silfên inthieng naw ang a na; kan rêng hin hna angin kan vuoi hlak a; kan khawhlonahai hin thli angin a mi lên hmang hlak."
7,"And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.","Chuongchun, i hming lama, nangma chel dinga mâni insukhar tukhawm an um dêr nawh a, keini kuoma hin i hmai i thup ta sih a; kan khawhlonahai hmangin i mi sukbo- hmang tah a nih."
8,"But now, O Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.","Tu ruok hin chu aw LALPA, nang chu kan pa i na; keini hi bepil kan na, nang chu a mi hemtu i na, chuong- chun, kan rêng hin i kutsuok kan nih."
9,"Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.","Aw LALPA, lunginsen talaw naw la, khawhlonahai khawm kumkhaw- tluong chun hre zing naw rawh; ngai ta, lunginsiettakin mi en la, kan rêng hin i mihai kan ni hi."
10,"Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.","I khawpui inthienghai chu thlalêrah a hung inchang a, Zion chu thlalêrah a hung inchang a, Jerusa- lem chu hmun râusanah a hung inchang ta hi."
11,"Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.","Kan in inthieng le kan in mawitak, kan puhaiin an lo inpâkna hlak che chu, meia raw a na; kan thil ditumhai po po hlak chu suksietin a um ta vawng sih a."
12,"Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O Jehovah? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?","Aw LALPA, chuong thilahai chun în sûm thei ding am a nih? I to zingin i mi sukrimsi nasa zing ding am a nih?"
