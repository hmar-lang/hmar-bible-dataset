11,"He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and will gently lead those that have their young.","Ama chun berâm vêngtu angin a pâwl chu châwm a ta, berâmtehai chu a bânin pawm khâwm a tih, a âng- sûnga siein fepui a ta, te ṭhuoi laihai chu damtêin ṭhuoi diel diel a tih,” ti rawh."
12,"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?","Tuin am tuihai chu a kutpha zâwla chau inkhih a, vân khi khâp chaua inkhih a, hnuoia pilvut hi te- khâwng pakhat chaua thun vawng a, tlânghai chu khaina chaua bûk a, muol pâwng hai chu bûkna chaua bûk kha le?"

26,"Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.","Chungtienga khin in mithai hang inlên unla, khienghai khi tu siem am an na, en ta u: ama chun sipaihai khi indawt peiin a ṭhuoi suok hlak a, an hmingin a ko seng hlak a; a hrâtna nasat lei le, thilthawtheina tienga a hrât leiin pakhat khawm kim naw an um ngai nawh."
27,"Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah, and the justice due to me is passed away from my God?","Iengdinga, aw Jakobhai, hieng anga in thaw am a na, iengdinga, aw Israelhai, hieng anga in hril am a na, “Ka lampui hi LALPAA inthawka thup a na, ro a mi rêlpêkna hi ka Pathiena inthawka lâk hmang a ni tah,” ti hi?"
28,"Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? The everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding.","In lungrilin in hriet zing hlak nâwm a nih? In nain in hriet ngai nâwm a nih? Kumkhaw Pathien, LALPA, kâwlkawdawng chen Siemtu chu, a châu ngai nawh a, a sâwl ngai bawk nawzie hi; a hrietthiemzie chu zawng suok ruol a ni nawh."
