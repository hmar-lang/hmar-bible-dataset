2,"Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing, will he cast down to the earth with the hand.","Ngai ta, LALPA chun mi hrât thilthawtheitak a nei a; ama chun riel nasatak tla dur dur, thlipui thil sukse rem rum ang le, tuilien nasatak lien zur zur ang elin, hnuoiah pei chawr a tih."
3,The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot:,Ephraimhai zu inruihmang chapona lallukhum chu sirdein um a ta;
4,"and the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the first-ripe fig before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.","an mawina ropui pâr ṭuoi mêk, ruom ṭhatakin a khum chu, nipui hmaa theichang hmin hmasa tak, a entuin a hmuh a, a kuta a um phinga a fâk zo el hlak ang chu nîng a tih."
5,"In that day will Jehovah of hosts become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people;","Chu nia chun sipaihai LALPA chu, a mi la um sunhai ta dingin ropuina lallukhum dâm, mawina lukhum dâm,"
6,"and a spirit of justice to him that sitteth in judgment, and strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate.","rorêl dinga ṭhung ta dinga rorêlna thlarau dâm, kul kawtkhâr bula hung thawtuhai dangkîrtuhai ta dinga hrâtna nîng a tih."
7,"And even these reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they stagger with strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.","Nisienlakhawm, chuonghai khawm chu uoin leiin an thle an thle a, zu leiin an pêm an pêm a, thiempuhai le zâwlneihai chu zu leiin an thle a, uoin lem zoin an um a, zu leiin an pêm an pêm a; inlârna thuah an thle an thle hlak a, rorêlna thuah an pêm an pêm hlak."
8,"For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.",Hmun fai hrim hrim um naw khawpin dawkân po po chu luok le thil pawrchein a sip a nih.
9,"Whom will he teach knowledge? and whom will he make to understand the message? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?",Hrietna tieng chu tu hîm ân chûktir ding a ni leh? Thucha chu tu hîm ân hriettir ding a ni leh? Nene nêk bân chauhai le nêne innêktir ta lohai hîm an ni ding?
10,"For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.","Thununna thu chunga thu- nunna thu inchuon a, thununna thu chunga thununna thu inchuon a, dân chunga dân inchuon a, dân chunga dân inchuon a; hitakah tlâwmte, sawtakah tlâwmte, ti ruok a ni sih a."
11,"Nay, but by men of strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to this people;","Anih, nisienlakhawm, hmûr danglam put mi hmangin, ṭawng dangin hieng mihai kuoma hin thu hril lem tâng a tih:"
12,"to whom he said, This is the rest, give ye rest to him that is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.","“Hi hi a nih châwlna chu, sâwl- hai chu inchâwltir ro; hi hi a nih insukharna chu,” a tihai chu: nisien- lakhawm, an ngai nuom si nawh."
13,"Therefore shall the word of Jehovah be unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.","Chuleiin, an feh a, an thala an tlûk a, an kawinawi a, chânga an âwk a, mana an um theina dingin, LALPA thu chu annirawi ta ding chun, thu- nunna thu chunga thununna inchuon a, thununna thu chunga thununna inchuon a, dân chunga dân inchuon a, dân chunga dân inchuon a; sawtakah tlawmte, hitakah tlâwmte ti ruok ni el a tih."
14,"Wherefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scoffers, that rule this people that is in Jerusalem:","Chuleichun, mi hmusit hmang- hai, hieng mihai, Jerusalema umhai ro rêlpêktuhai, LALPA thu hi hre ro."
15,"Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:","“Thina kuomah thu kan thlung tah, Seol leh thu kan intiem tah; vuokna tui lien liem chu a luong tlang pha khawm keini chen chun luong naw nih; khêl thu dâm kan inhumhim- na dingin kan hmang a, khêl hnuoi- ah kan inbihmang ta sih a,” in ti leiin;"
16,"therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not be in haste.","chuleiin, Lalpa Pathien chun hieng ang hin a hril, “Ngai ta, lung, lung fie hnung, a kia lung hlutak ka phûm, dettak chu, Ziona chun lung- phûm dingin ka rem hi; ama ringtu chu inhmaw naw nih."
17,"And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.","Rorêlna fel chu a suktlûnna hruiin hmang ka ta, felna chu a dârmûmkhaiah hmang ka tih, riel chun inhumhimna khêl thuhai chu dêng hmang vawng a ta, tuihai chun inbîkhmangna chu chîm tlum a tih."
18,"And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.","Chun, thina kuoma in thu- thlung chu sûtin um a ta, Seol le in thutiem khawm chu ngir suok naw ni, vuokna tui lien liem chu a luong tlang pha chun, chu pha chun sirdein um in tih."
19,"As often as it passeth through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night: and it shall be nought but terror to understand the message.","A luong tlang po leh la pei a ti cheu a; tûk tin tûk tinin, a sûn a zânin, a luong tlang âwm sih a; thu incha umze hriet chu thil râpthlâk ruok nîng a tih,” tiin."
20,For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.,Khum chu inthluongna dingin a tawi ta law sih a; puonthuo chu inkhumna dingin a chîn talaw bawk si.
21,"For Jehovah will rise up as in mount Perazim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.","A sin, a sin danglam chu, a thaw theina ding le, a thilthaw, a thilthaw danglam chu a muolsuo theina dingin, LALPA chu Perazim tlânga a tho ang khan a tho ding a ni sih a, Gibeon ruoma a lunginsen ang khan a lunginsen ding a ni sih a."
22,"Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for a decree of destruction have I heard from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon the whole earth.","Chuongchun, mi hmusit hmang- tuhai ni ta naw ro, chuong naw chun, in kawl bunhai chu ringumtakin siem rawi an tih; tâwpna, tâwpna tlung ngei dinga ruot tlat chu, hnuoi pum- pui chunga a tlung ding thu, Lalpa, sipaihai LALPA kuoma inthawk chun ka hriet sih a."
23,"Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.","Na sit unla, ka râwl hi hre ro, ngai unla, ka thu hril hi hre ro."
24,Doth he that ploweth to sow plow continually? doth he continually open and harrow his ground?,Hnuoi inlettu chun chi thena dingin hnuoi chu ân let ân let el hlak am a nih? a hnuoi tlanghai chu a suknawiin a sukphit zing hlak am a nih?
25,"When he hath levelled the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows, and the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in the border thereof?","A chung chu a chawkruol zoin Mohuri chu a thedar ni lo am a nih? Zira dâm khawm a the ni lo am a nih? Bu dâm chu a tlarin, buṭei  dâm chu hmun ruotah, mimhai khawm chu a hnâwm hrûlah a tû hlak ni lo am a nih?"
26,"For his God doth instruct him aright, and doth teach him.",A Pathien chun ama chu feltak- in a thununin ân chûktir hlak sih a.
27,"For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.","Mohuri chu bu chîlna khâwl ngeiin an chil ngai si nawh a, zira chungahai chun tawlailîr kehai chu an inhlumtir ngai bawk nawh; mohu- ri chu hmawlin an vuok lem hlak."
28,"Bread grain is ground; for he will not be always threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he doth not grind it.","Beiphit bu chu râwtnawiin a um hlak, kumkhuoin a vuok zing âwm si nawh a, tawlailîr ke le a sakawr chun sukdar sienla khawm, ân râwt- nawitir ngai nawh."
29,"This also cometh forth from Jehovah of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.","Chuong khawm chu sipaihai LALPA, inrâwnna kawnga mi mak- tak le, varna kawnga mi ṭhatak kuoma chu a suok a nih."
