1,"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.","Lal Hezekia chun chu chu a hriet phingleh a silfênhai chu a keithlêr a, saiip puon ân bel a, LALPA ina chun a lût tah a."
2,"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.","Chun, a sûnghai chunga hotua um Eliakim le lekhaziektu Sebna le thiempuhai upahai chu saiip puon inbelin Amoz naupa zâwlnei Isai kuomah a tir a."
3,"And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Hezekia chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Vawisûn ni hi lunginzîngna ni le hmingsietna ni a nih, nauhai chu an pieng a hun ta sih a; anni chu nei dingin hrâtna a um ta si nawh,"
4,"It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.","Rabsake, a pu Assuria lalin Pathien hring hrilse dinga a itirpa thuhrilhai chu LALPA i Pathienin a naa a hriethai chun la kâwk ngei a tih; chuleiin, hlabîka la umhai ta ding hin i ṭawngṭâina chu hang inhlân rawh,’ a tih a,” an ta."
5,So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.,"Chuongchun, lal Hezekia sie- hlawhai chu zâwlnei Isai kuoma chun an hung a."
6,"And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.","Isai chun an kuomah, “In pu kuoma chun hieng ang hin in hril ding a nih, ‘LALPA chun hieng ang hin a tih, I thu hriet, Assuria lal siehlawhaiin an mi hrilsietnahai kha ṭi naw rawh."
7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.","Ngai ta, a phîng sûnga chun thlarau inumtir ka ta, chuongchun, thuthang lo hrieng a ta, ama ramah fe nâwk el a tih; chuongchun, ama ram ngeia chun kâwlhnâma sukthlûkin inumtir ka tih, a tih a,’ tiin,” a ta."
8,"So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.","Chuongchun, Rabsake chu a kîr nâwk a, Assuria lal chun Libna khuo a lo thaw lai chu a va hmuh a, Lakis khuoa inthawk chun a fe suok tah ti a hriet sa hrim a na."
9,"And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,","Chun, Assuria lal Sennakerib chun Tirhak Ethiopia ram lal chung- châng thu, “Nangma thaw dingin a suok tah,” ti mi hril a hriet a. Chuong- chun, chu chu a hriet phingleh Hezekia kuomah palaihai a tir a."
10,"Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.","“Hieng ang hin Juda lal Hezekia kuomah in hril ding a nih, ‘I ring Pathien chun Jerusalem khuo Assuria lal kutah pêk ni naw nih, tiin hlêm naw raw se che."
11,"Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?","Ngai ta, Assuria lalhaiin ram po po sukse vawngin an chunga an thilthawhai kha i nain i hriet a; nang hi sanhimin i um bîk ding am a nih?"
12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?","Hnam tin pathienhai chun, Gozan mihai dâm, Haran mihai dâm, Rezeph mihai dâm, Eden nau Telas- sar khuoa umhai dâm, a mi thlatu- haiin an sukbohmang hai kha, an sanhim am a nih?"
13,"Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?","Hamath lal dâm, Arpad lal dâm, Sepharvaim khawpui lal dâm, Hena lal dâm, Ivva lal dâm kha khâw lai am an um ta leh?’ tiin,” a ta."
14,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.","Chun, Hezekia chun palaihai kuta inthawk chun lekha chu a hmuh a, a hang tiem a, chuongchun, Hezekia chu LALPA ina chun a hang lût a, LALPA hmaa chun a phar tah a."
15,"And Hezekiah prayed unto Jehovah, saying,","Hezekia chu LALPA kuomah a ṭawngṭai a,"
16,"O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest above the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.","“Aw sipaihai LALPA, Israel Pathien, cherubhai chunga ṭhung, nang hi, nang chau hi, hnuoi chunga um po pohai Pathien chu i nih, nang chun hnuoi le vân hi i siem a nih."
17,"Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to defy the living God.","Aw LALPA, i na hung sit la, ngai ta; aw LALPA, i mit meng la, en ta; Pathien hring hi hrilse dinga mihai tirtu Sennakerib thuhai po po hi ngai ta."
18,"Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,","LALPA, Assuria lalhaiin ram po po le an inchâwk chu an suksiet ngei luoh a,"
19,"and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.","an pathienhai chu meiah an pei bawk a; chuonghai chu Pathien an ni naw hrim a nih; mihriem kuta siem, thing le lung an ni lem; chuleichun, an sukbohmang a nih."
20,"Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, even thou only.","Chuleiin, aw LALPA kan Pathien, nang hi, nang chau hi, LALPA i nih ti leihnuoi hluo ram po po hin an hriet theina dingin annia inthawk hin mi sandam rawh,” tiin."
21,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,","Chun, chuong lai chun Amoz naupa Isai chun Hezekia kuoma chun mi a tir a, hieng ang hin a hril a, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun hieng ang hin a ti a nih: Assuria lal Senna- kerib sietna ding tienga ka kuoma i ṭawngṭai leiin,"
22,this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.,"hi hi a chungchâng thu LALPA- IN a hril chu a nih: Zion naunu nunghâk chun a hmusit cheh a, a nuisan che; Jerusalem naunu chun a lu a thin khum che."
23,Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.,"Tu am i sukhmingsietin, i hril- siet a? Tu chung âm i râwl i sukpuom a, i mit i suksâng? Israel Mi Inthieng chung ngeiah."
24,"By thy servants hast thou defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field;","I siehlawhai hmangin LALPA chu i sukhmingsiet a, Ka tawlailîr tamtakhai leh tlâng ram, Lebanon ram rilahai hin ka hung tlung tah a; sidar thing insângtakhai le a far thing ṭha mihai hi phûr ka ta; a hmun inzotak, a hnuoi ṭhatna hmun ram- puia chun lût ka tih."
25,"I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.","Tuisunsuo ka cho a, tui ka dâwn hlak a; ka kepha hnuoi hin Aigupta vadung po po chu sukkang vawng ka tih, i tih a."
26,"Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.","Keimain inhmaa inthawka chuong chu ka thaw a na, tienlaia chuong chu ka siem an nih ti i hriet nâwm a nih? Khuo kulpui neihai kha in chim khâwm el anga suksetu i ni theina dingin tuhin kân tlungtir a ni ta hi."
27,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field of grain before it is grown up.","Chuleiin, a sûnga umhai chu an hrât mang nawh a, an ṭih a, an hung muolpho ta kha; phûl hlobet ang le, hlohna hring ang le, in chunga hlohna ang le, lo bu ṭhat hma ang chau an ni kha."
28,"But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.","“Kei ruok chun chu i ṭhung dâm, i suok dâm, i lût dâm, ka chunga i lunginsenziehai hi ka hriet i sawn- naw."
29,"Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.","Ka chunga i lunginsen lei le, i ṭawng mingemzie chu ka naa hin a hung lût tâk leiin ka hnâr inbûk chu i hnârah inbûk ka ta, ka thîrse chu i hmûrah inbûk bawk ka tih; i hungna lampui ngeia khan inkîrtir nâwk ka ti che, tiin"
30,"And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.","Chun, hi hi i ta dinga inchikna ding chu nîng a tih; tu kum hin bu inhli ring in ta, kum nâwk khawm chu inhli bawk chu ring in tih; chun, a kum thumnaa chun bu tu unla, ât unla, grêp huonhai siem unla, a ra chu fa ro."
31,"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.","Chun, Juda sûnghai laia a la dam sunhai chu a suktienga zung- keia, a tungzâwnga rain um nâwk a tih."
32,"For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.","Jerusalema inthawkin a la um sunhai chu suok an ta, Zion tlânga inthawkin a la dam dinghai chu suok bawk an tih; sipaihai LALPA ṭha- hnemngaina chun chuong chu thâwng a tih."
33,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun Assuria lal chungchâng thuah hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Ama chun chu hi khawpui hi hung tlung naw nih a; hitaka hin thal kâp bawk naw ni, phaw leh a kâwla hin hung bawk naw nih a, a thawna dingin hnuoi kul siem bawk naw ni, LALPAIN a tih."
34,"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.","A hungna lampui, chutaka ngei chun kîr nâwk a ta, hi khawpui hi hung tlung naw nih."
35,"For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.","Keima le ka siehlaw David leiin hi khawpui hi sanhim dingin ka hum ding a nih’ tiin,” a tih a."
36,"And the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.","Chuongchun, LALPA vântirko chu a va suok a. Assuria mihai riekhmuna chun mi nuoi khat, sing riet sâng nga a sukhlum a; chun, zîngkâra mi an hang tho chun ngai ta, mithi ruong khât ngawt a lo ni tah a."
37,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.","Chuongchun, Assuria lal Sen- nakerib chu a suok a, a feh a, a kîr nâwk ta pei a. Ninevi khuoa chun a um ta zing a."
38,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.","Chun, a pathien Nisrok ina chun pathien a biek laiin a naupa- salhai Adrammelek le Sarezer hai chun kâwlhnâmin an sât hlum a; chuongchun, an tlânhmang a, Ararat rama chun an lût tah a. Chun, a naupa Esar-haddon chun ama aiawin ro a rêl tah a."
