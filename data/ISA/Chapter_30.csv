3,"Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.","Chuleiin, Pharao hrâtna chu in muolphona ni tâng a ta, Aigupta hlim in lo ring hi in inzakna ni tâng a tih."

6,"The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.","Sim rama sahai phurrik chu.

8,"Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.","Tuhin fe la, chuong chu an hmaa lekhaziekna phêkah ziek la, lekha- bua khawm ziek rawh, hi hnunga kumkhawtluonga ding a ni theina dingin."
9,"For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of Jehovah;","Chuonghai chu mi hel hmang dâm, nau khêlhlip dâm, nau, LALPA dân ngai nuom lohai an ni sih a;"
10,"that say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits,","hmutheituhai kuomah, “Hmu naw ro,” zâwlneihai kuomah, “Thil indikhai mi hrillâwk ro, thil inhawi tieng kan kuomah hril ro, hlêmna thu hrillâwk naw ro;"
11,"get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.","lampui boah fe ro, lampui sîrah pêt ro; Israelhai Mi Inthieng chu kan hmaa inthawk hin sukbo ro,” ti hlaktuhai chu."
12,"Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely thereon;","Chu lei chun, Israelhai Mi Inthieng chun hieng ang hin a hril a, “Hi hi thu hi in hmusit lei le nêksâwrna le kâwmawsietna in ring a, a chunga in innghat leiin;"
13,"therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant.","hi khawhlona hi nangni ta ding chun lung bang insângtak a se lai, chim vâng vâng, pâwng pûr, kârloa, mitkhapkârloa se rup ding ang hi a ni ding a nih."
14,"And he shall break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd wherewith to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.","Chuongchun, bêlhemtu bêl chu an suknawi ang hin, hla um dêr loa kawinawiin, a hlek laia, behâr thuka mei lâkna ding amanih, tuikhura tui thâlna ding amani khawm um lo khawpin, sukkawi nawi a tih,” tiin."
15,"For thus said the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. And ye would not:","Lalpa PATHIEN, Israelhai Mi Inthieng chun hieng ang hin a hril ta sih a, “Kîr nâwka châwla umin san- damin um in ta; muongtaka umnaa le ringtaka umnaa hin in hrâtna um a tih,” tiin, nisienlakhawm, in nuom si nawh."
16,"but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.","“Ni lo, sakawr chunga chuongin tlân dur dur kan tih,” in ti lem sih a; chuleiin, tlân dur dur ngei in tih; “Thil hrâttak chungah chuong kan tih” in tih a; chuleiin, a hnawttu dinghai cheu chu hrâttak nîng an tih."
17,"One thousand shall flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.","Mi pakhat ihrâwkin tlân dur dur in tih; a tâwpa chun tlâng sîpa pholêng târ ang le, muol chunga inchikna mâksana um angin la um el in tih."
18,"And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for Jehovah is a God of justice; blessed are all they that wait for him.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun a lungin- siet theina ding cheuin, nghâk a ta, chuleiin, a lainat theina ding cheuin chawimawiin um a tih; LALPA chu rorêl felna Pathien a ni sih a; ama nghâktuhai po po chu an hamṭha ie."
19,"For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; thou shalt weep no more; he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear, he will answer thee.","Mihai chu Jerusalema Ziona chun an um ding a ni sih a; ṭap nâwk ta naw ti niu a, in khêk ria chun ama chun lunginsiet ngei ngei a ti cheu a, a hriet phingleh dawn a ti cheu."
20,"And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers;","Lalpa chun lunginzîngna bu le rinumna tui pe sienla cheu khawm, in inchûktirtuhai chu inbihmangin um ta naw ni hai a, in mitin in inchûk- tirtuhai chu hmu lem tâng a tih;"
21,"and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.","chun, changtienga kal in chawi- in amanih, vawitienga kal in chawiin amanih, hnungtienga thu, in nain, “Hi hi lampui a nih, hitaka hin fe ro,” ti hre pei a tih."
22,"And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as an unclean thing; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.","Chun, in tangka milim siem, tangkaruoa cheina le in rângkachak milim sung, rângkachak tuia inluon- na chu, suksieng in ta, thil pawrche angin pei tâng in tih; a kuoma chun, “Fe hmang dai rawh,” tîng in tih."
23,"And he will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures;","Chuongchun, ama chun in bu chi hnuoia in tu ding ta ding chun ruotui chu pêng a ta; hnuoia thil mâwnghai chu bu dingin pêng a tih; chu chu ṭhatak, hlâwktak nîng a ta, chu nia chun in ranhai chu ran tlatna hmun lientakahai chun tlâng an tih."
24,"the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.","Bâwngchal le sabengtungtê hnuoi inlettuhai chun bu al, suodûr le leipupa sukfai sa, fa bawk an tih."
25,"And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, brooks and streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.","Chun, inthatna nasatak nia râl vêng inhai chu a chim ni chun, tlâng insâng tina le muol pâwng insâng tina chun vadungpuihai le vadungtê tui luonghai hung um a tih."
26,"Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.","Chu naw khawm chu, LALPA chun a mihai silna chu a tuom a, an sâtna pawphai chu a sukdam ni chun, thla var chu nisa var tlukin um tâng a ta, nisa var chu a lêt sariin, ni sari sûng var tlukin, um tâng a tih."
27,"Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire;","Ngai ta, LALPA hming chu, a lunginsennaa chawk hlut hlut meikhu sâmup intung lui lui lai chun, hlataka inthawkin a hung ie; a hmûr- hai chu lungninawnain a sip a, a lei chu thil kânghmang mei ang a na;"
28,"and his breath is as an overflowing stream, that reacheth even unto the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction: and a bridle that causeth to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples.","a thuok chu bohmangna leidâra hnam tin rel dingin, vadung rîng chen zet a kuong liem dûl dûl ang a nih; chun, mi tin baua chun ṭhuoi suoltir- na kei dingin hrui um a tih."
29,"Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.","Chun, zâna ruoiṭhe inthienga an ṭheh a, hla an sak angin hla sak in tih; LALPA tlânga Israelhai Lungpui kuom tlung dinga theihle le an fe laia lungril hlimna an nei angin lungril hlimna khawm nei in tih."
30,"And Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, and tempest, and hailstones.","Chun, LALPA chun a râwl ro- puitak chu inhriettir tâng a ta, a lunginsenna nasatak le thil kâng- hmang meichawkin, thlipui le ruopui le rielin, a kut thlâk dân chu inentir tâng a tih."
31,For through the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be dismayed; with his rod will he smite him.,"LALPA râwl lei chun Assuria mi, hembawka mi vaw hlaktu chu suknawiin a um ding a ni ta sih a."
32,"And every stroke of the appointed staff, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, shall be with the sound of tabrets and harps; and in battles with the brandishing of his arm will he fight with them.",Ama chu hmawl ruotsaa LALPAIN a vuok po leh khuongtêhai le ṭingṭanghai leh vuong a ta; a hmawl inleta inthawnahai chun anni chu thâwng a tih.
33,"For a Topheth is prepared of old; yea, for the king it is made ready; he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.","Topheth pakhat chu inhma daia lo buotsai tah a ni sih a, anih, lal ta ding chun siem zosa hieu a nih; inthûktak le lientakin a siem a, a thil sêkkhâwl chu mei le thing tamtak a nih; LALPA thuok, kât vadung luong ang chun a sukkâng dur dur a."
