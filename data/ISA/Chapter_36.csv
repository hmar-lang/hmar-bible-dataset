1,"Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.","Chun, lal Hezekia kum sâwm- palina kuma chun, Assuria ram lal Sennakerib chu Juda rama khuo kulpui neihai po po chu thaw dingin a hang feh a, a lâk tah a."
2,And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.,"Chun, Assuria lal chun Rabsake chu sipaihai tamtak ṭhuoiin Lakis khuoa inthawkin Jerusalema lal Hezekia kuoma chun a tir a. Chun, dîl sakhnung lem tuilâkna kâwla puon sâwptu phûl lamliena chun a ngîr a."
3,"Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.","Chuongchun, lal sûnghai chunga hotua um Hilkia naupa Eliakim hai, lekhaziektu Sebna hai, chanchin ziektu Asaph naupa Joa hai chu a kuomah an hung suok a."
4,"And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?","Chun, Rabsake chun an kuomah, “Hezekia kuoma chun hieng ang hin hril ro, ‘Lal ropuitak Assuria lal chun hieng ang hin a tih, I ringna în nghatna hi ieng am a ni leh?"
5,"I say, thy counsel and strength for the war are but vain words: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?",Indona ding chun i remruot le i hrâtna hi thu mei mei a nih; tu am i ringa ka chunga hel i ni ta leh?
6,"Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.","Ngai ta, hi luong hmawl pawr, Aigupta hi, i ring a ni hi, chu chu miin a ringsan chun a kutah sunlût ngei a tih; Aigupta lal Pharao chu ama ringtuhai po po chunga chun chuong ang chu a ni hlak."
7,"But if thou say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?","Annawleh, ka kuomah, LALPA kan Pathien chu a nih kan ring chu, i ti chun, ama chu Hezekia chun Judahai kuoma le Jerusalem mihai kuomah, Hi mâichâm hmaa chau hin inbiek ding a nih, tiin, a bâwlhmun le a mâichâmhai a lâk hmangpêk kha a ni nâwm a nih?"
8,"Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.","Chuongchun, ka hni che hi, ka pu Assuria lal kuoma chun thu tiem rawh, chuongchun, keiin sakawr sâng hni pêng ka ti che, nangin a chunga chuongtu dinghai i ngaituo thei ding phawt chun."
9,"How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?","Iengtin am tawlailîrhai le sa- kawr chung chuong mihai tieng thuah Aigupta chunga i ringna in- nghatin, ka pu siehlaw chîn takhai laia hotu pakhat khawm hi i dang zo ding am a nih?"
10,"And am I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.","Chun, hi ram hi sukse dinga thaw dingin LALPA ṭhang loa hung am ka nih? LALPAIN ka kuomah, Chu ram chu thaw dingin hang fe la, sukse rawh, a mi ti a nih,’ tiin,” a ta."
11,"Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.","Chun, Eliakim le Sebna le Joa hai chun Rabsake kuomah, “Kan hni che hi i siehlawhai hi Suria ṭawngin mi be ta rawh, chu chu kan hriet thei si a; kul bang chunga mihai na hrietah Juda ṭawngin mi be ta naw raw khai,” an tih a."
12,"But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?","Nisienlakhawm, Rabsake chun, “Ka pu chun in pu kuom chau le in kuom chaua hieng thu hi hril dingin a mi tir am a nih? Kul bang chunga ṭhunghai, nangni le mâni êk la fa dinghai le mâni zun la dâwn dinghai kuoma hin a mi tir lem a ni nâwm a nih?” a ta."
13,"Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.","Chun, Rabsake chu a ngîr a, Juda ṭawngin râwl inringtakin a khêk a, “Lal ropuitak Assuria lal thuhai hi lo ngai ro."
14,"Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you:","Lal chun hieng ang hin a tih, ‘Hezekia hlêmin um nuom naw ro; ama chun a sandam thei âwm si naw cheu a,"
15,"neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.","Hezekia chun, LALPA chun matheiloin mi sandam ngei a tih; hi khawpui hi Assuria lal kutah pêkin um naw nih, tiin hril sienla khawm LALPA chu Hezekian a hril lei elin ring nuom chuong naw ro."
16,"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;","Hezekia thu ngai naw ro, Assuria lal chun hieng ang hin a hril sih a, Mîn rempui unla ka kuoma hin hung suok ro, mi tinin mâni grêp hruia mi le mi tinin mâni theichang kûnga mi fa seng unla, mi tinin mâni tuikhur tui dâwn seng ro:"
17,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.","ka hunga nangni ram anga bei le uoin umna ram, bei le grêp huonhai umna rama ka fepui hmâkhat cheu chun."
18,"Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?","LALPAIN mi sandam a tih, tîn, Hezekia hin thlêm hlau rawi a ti cheu, fîmkhur ro. Hnam tin pathien laia mi hrim hrimin an ram chu Assuria lala inthawkin an sanhim ta hlak am a nih?"
19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?,Hamath le Arpadhai pathienhai kha khâw lai am an um tah a? Sepharvaimhai pathienhai kha khâw lai am an um tah a? Samari khuo kha keimaa inthawk khan an sanhim ta am a nih?
20,"Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?","Chuong ram pathienhai po po laia mi chun tuhaiin am an ram keimaa inthawkin an sanhim ta hlak leh? LALPA chun Jerusalem hi keimaa inthawk hin sanhim uok a ti maw?’ tiin,” a ta."
21,"But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.","Anni ruok chu an to zing a, bau khat khawma an dawn nawh; lal thupêk chu, “Ama chu dawn naw ro,” ti a ni sih a."
22,"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.","Chuongchun, lal sûnghai chunga hotua um Hilkia naupa Eliakim hai, lekhaziektu Sebna hai, chanchin ziektu Asaph naupa Joa hai chu silfên keithlêr inbelin Hezekia kuoma chun an hung tlung a, Rabsake thuhrilhai chu an hril tah a."
