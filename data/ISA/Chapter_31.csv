1,"Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah!","Aigupta rama ṭhangpuina zawnga zu feh a, sakawrhai chunga ringna innghat a, a tam leia tawlailîrhai le an hrât êm leia sakawr chunga chuong mihai ring a, Israel- hai Mi Inthieng tieng en si loa, LALPA khawm râwn si lohai chu an chung a rik ie!"

3,"Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.","Aigupta mihai chu Pathien an ni nawh a; mihriem el an na; an sakawr- hai chu thlarau an ni nawh a, tisa el an na; chuongchun, LALPAIN a kut a phar pha chun a ṭhangpuitu chu pêm thlawk thlawk a ta, a ṭhangpuina khawm chu tlûng a ta, an rêng chun bohmang vawng lem an tih."
4,"For thus saith Jehovah unto me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will Jehovah of hosts come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.","LALPA chun hieng ang hin ka kuomah a hril sih a, “Sakeibaknei le sakeibaknei vânglaiin a sa hau lai chun berâm vêngtu tamtak a thaw dinga ko suokin um hai sienla khawm, an râwl chu ṭi naw nih a, an risiet leiin ân tîm chuong naw ding ang hin, sipaihai LALPA chu Zion tlânga le a muol pâwnga thaw dingin a hung ṭum ding a nih."
5,"As birds hovering, so will Jehovah of hosts protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver it, he will pass over and preserve it.","Vatehai an bu chunga an vuong an vuong ang hin sipaihai LALPA chun Jerusalem khuo chu vêng a ta; vêng a ta sansuok a tih, fe kânin humhim bawk a tih."

8,"And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of men, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to taskwork.","“Chu pha chun Assuria mi chu, mihriem kâwlhnâma sukthlûk ni loin, kâwlhnâm sukthlûkin um a tih; chun, kâwlhnâm mihriemhai ta ni loin ama chu fa zo a tih; kâwlhnâma inthawk chun tlân hmang a ta, a tlangvâlhai chu sie chawitu hung ni tâng an tih."
9,"And his rock shall pass away by reason of terror, and his princes shall be dismayed at the ensign, saith Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.","Chun, a lungpui chu thil râp- thlâktak leiin bohmang a ta, a mi lienhai chu inchikna leiin lunginzîng tâng an tih,” tiin; LALPA, a mei Ziona um le, a rawtuina mei Jerusalema um chun a tih."
