9,"Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not thou that didst cut Rahab in pieces, that didst pierce the monster?","Aw LALPA bân, har la, har la, hrâtna thar inbel rawh; tienlaia, tien- lai suonhai um laia i har ang khan har rawh. Nang hi Rahab sât nawi- tu, dragon suntu kha i ni an nâwm a nih?"

13,"and hast forgotten Jehovah thy Maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fearest continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he maketh ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?","LALPA nangni siemtu, vân kei- phara leihnuoi innghatsanhai phûm- tu theinghila, nêksâwrtu sukse dinga a tin lai lunginsenna lei ngawta sûnnithlâka ṭi zing chu, tu am i nih a?

21,"Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:","Chuleiin, nang sukrinum le uoin inrui ni si loa mi inrui, hi hi lo hre ta rawh:"
22,"Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; thou shalt no more drink it again:","i LALPA Jehova, i Pathien, a mihai thu hrilpui hlaktu chun hieng ang hin a tih; “Ngai ta, pêm pêm- na no, ka lunginsenna no berbu ngei chu, i kuta inthawkin ka lâk suok tah; dâwn nâwk ta naw ti ni;"
23,"and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee, that have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that go over.","chuongchun, nangma sukrimsi- tuhai kuta chun sieng ka ta, anni chun i hringna kuomah, ‘Kan hraw ding chein bawkkhup rawh,’ an ti kha; chuongchun, nangin a hrawtu- hai kuoma chun i ruongzâng chu leilâk ang le kawthlêr angin i daw kha,” tiin."
