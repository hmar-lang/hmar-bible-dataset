4,"Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.","Ama chun, “I ina hin ieng am an en kha?” a ta. Hezekia chun, “Ka in sûnga um po po chu an en vawng, ka ro ṭhahai laia mi kân entir naw iengkhawm a um nawh,” tiin a dawn a."
