1,"Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.","Aw Babulon nau nunghâk, ṭum la, pilvutah ṭhung rawh; aw Kaldai naunu, lalṭhungpha boin hnuoiah ṭhung rawh; inno le ṭha an ti ta naw ding che a nih."
2,"Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.","Bu râwtnawina lunghai la la, beiphit siem rawh: în khumna puon kha sie la, i fenfuol kha hlîp la, i ke kha hâwk la, vadunghai pal kai rawh."
3,"Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.","I saruokna chu inkhum loin um a ta, anih, i zamaw chu inlang a tih; phuba lâng ka ta, mi tukhawm in- rempui naw ningah."
4,"Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.","A mîn tlantu chu a hming sipai- hai LALPA a na, Israelhai Mi Inthieng chu."
5,"Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.","Aw Kaldai naunu, to zingin ṭhung la, inthim hnuoiah lût ta, “Ram tin lalnu,” an ti ta naw ding che a nih."
6,"I was wroth with my people, I profaned mine inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.","Ka mihai chungah ka lunginsen a, ka rochan chu ka sukpawrcheh a, i kutah pêng ka ti cheh a, nang chun an chungah lunginsietna hrim hrim în langtir naw a, tarhai chung chena khawm i rîngkawl riktak chu în nghat a."
7,"And thou saidst, I shall be mistress for ever; so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end thereof.","Chun, “Kei hi kumkhuoin lal- nuah um ka tih,” i tih a; chuongchun, chuong thilhai chu i lungrilin i ngaituo nawh a, a tâwpna ding hlak chu i hriet zing bawk nawh a."
8,"Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, that sittest securely, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:","Chuongchun, nang nunkhuo phâm a, ngaisamtaka um a, mâni lungrila, “Keima ka nih, keima naw chu mi dang hrim hrim an um nawh, hmeithaiah ṭhung naw ning a, nauhai chân thu khawm hre bawk naw ning,” titu, hi hi hre rawh;"
9,"but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments.","hieng thil pahni: nauhai chânna le hmeithaina hin, ni khat thil thuah, mitkhapkâr loah, a hung nang lem ding che a nih; i dâwi hmangna chu tam hlein i invêngna chu tam rei rui sienla khawm, chuong chu nasatakin i chungah a hung tlung ding a nih."
10,"For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee, and thou hast said in thy heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.","I rîtlona chu i ring a, “Tu- khawma an mi hmu nawh,” i ti vei sih a, i varna le i hrietna chun a suk- khawhlo cheh a, “Keima ka nih, keima naw chu mi dang hrim an um nawh,” i lungrilin i ti bawk a."
11,"Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know the dawning thereof: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou knowest not.","Chuleiin, thil ṭha naw i chung- ah hung tlung a ta; invêng dân khawm thiem naw ti ni; vângduoina khawmin hung vur a ti cheh a, chu chu sukbo thei naw ti nih: rausanna khawm kârloin i chungah hung tlung thut a ta, chu chu hre lâwk naw ti nih."
12,"Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.","În vêngna le i dâwi hmangna, i naupangtea inthawka în suksâwl hlak- nahai chu ngîrpui ta la; i ṭhathnem- pui thei ding phawt a, i hnepui thei ding phawt chun."
13,"Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.","I remruot a tam êm leiin i sâwl ta a ni hi: tuhin chu vân semtuhai, arasi thlîrtuhai, thlakipa thu hril- lâwktuhai chu ngîr sienla, i chunga thil hung tlung dinghaia inthawk chun sanhim raw se che."
14,"Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.","Ngai ta, bupâwl ang el nîng an ta; meiin kâng a tih; meichawk thil- thawtheinaa inthawk chun insanhim naw ni hai a; insuklumna ding mei- hawl ang khawm ni naw nih a, awi ding mei ang khawm ni bawk naw ni."
15,Thus shall the things be unto thee wherein thou hast labored: they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter; there shall be none to save thee.,"Chuongchun, în suksâwlna hlak thilhai chu a um ding a nih: i nau- pangtea inthawka i kuoma sum- dâwng hlaktuhai chu mâni lampui sengah invâk hmang an ta; sanhimtu ding che tukhawm um naw ni hai."
