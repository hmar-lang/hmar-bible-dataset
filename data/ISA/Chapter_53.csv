1,Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?,Kan thuhril tuin am a ring a? LALPA kut chu tu kuom am ân lang a?
2,"For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.","A hmaa chun thil ṭo innotak angin ama chu ân dâwn suok sih a, hnuoi ṭâwla zung angin a hung kak suok bawk a nih; pienken ṭhatna le hmêl mawina hrim hrim a nei nawh a, ama ei hmuin ama ei ditna dingin mawina hrim hrim a nei nawh."
3,"He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not.","Ama chu mihriemhai hmusit le dit nawin a um a; lungngainahai nei mi le natna hre mi a na, mihaiin an hmai an hipsan ang ang chun ama chu hmusitin a um a, eini hlak chun ama chu ei ngaisâng si nawh."
4,"Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.","Ama chun ei natnahai phurin, ei lungngainahai khawm a phur ngei a; nisienlakhawm,eini chun lungngaina ivurkhumah, Pathien vuokah, suk- rinumah, ei ngai sih a."
5,"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chu ei bawsietnahai leiin inhliemin a um a, ei khawhlonahai leiin vuok thidukin a um a; ei thlamuongna dinga thu- nunna chu a chungah a tlah a, a vuokna invuolhaia sukdamin ei um tah."
6,All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.,"Ei rêng hin berâm angin ei invâk hmang a, mâni lampui sengah ei pêt a; LALPA chun ama chunga chun ei rênga khawhlona chu ân nghat tah a."
7,"He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.","Ama chu nêksawr le sukrinumin a um a, nisienlakhawm, ân ngaitlâwm a, a bau khawm a ka nawh; berâmte that dinga an ṭhuoi ang le berâm a hmul vâwtu hmaa to zinga a um ang elin, anih, a bau a ka nawh."
8,"By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who among them considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?",Nêksâwrna le rorêlna lâk hmangin a um a; a dam ruolpuihai lem chun tuin am mi hring rama inthawka sukbohmanga a um chu ngaituo hrim an ta? Ka mihai baw- sietna leiin lungngaina invurkhumin a um a nih.
9,"And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.","Chun, thil nunsetaka thaw ngai loin, a bauah hlêmna hrim hrim um ngai naw sien khawm, a thlân chu mi suolhai kuomah an ruotpêk a, a thi hnung chun mi hausa kuom tieng a um a."
10,"Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPAIN ama chu vuok thiduk a nuom hrim a nih; a sukna ta ngei a; a hringna chu suol ta dinga thilinhlâna a hmang pha chun, a chithla chu hmu tâng a ta, a dam sûng nihai chu suksei a ta, LALPA dit zâwng chu a kuta hlawtlingin um a tih."
11,"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.","A hringna sininrim ra chu hmûng a ta, lungawi tâng a tih; ka siehlaw feltak chun a hrietnain mi tamtak chu thiem inchangtir a ta, an khawhlonahai chu phurpêk a tih."
12,"Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.","Chuleiin, ama chu mi lienhai chanvo ang sem vêng ka ta, ama chun râllâk sumhai chu mi hrâthai sem vêng a tih; a hringna chu thi khawp raka a bunthlâk a, bawsetuhai laia tiemsaa a um leiin; nisienlakhawm, mi tamtak suolna chu a phur a, baw- setuhai ta ding chun a ṭawngṭaipêk a."
