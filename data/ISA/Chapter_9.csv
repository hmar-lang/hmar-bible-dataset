1,"But there shall be no gloom to her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time hath he made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.","Nisienlakhawm, lunginzînga um- nu ta ding chun nguina hrim hrim um ta naw nih a. Tienlai chun Zebulun ram le Naphtali ram chu hmusitumin ân umtir a; nisienla- khawm, hun nuhnunga chun ro- puitakin ân umtir tah a, dîl pang- ah, Jordan râlah, hnam tin Galili chu."

3,"Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.","Hnam chu i suktam tah a, an hlimna khawm i sukpung tah a; bu sîk laia hlim angin i hmaah an hlim tah a, miin râllâk sum an sema an hlim ang elin."
4,"For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.","A rikphurna rîngkawl le a lieng- koa zâwnfung, a nêksâwrtu hem- bâwk chu, Midianhai hne ni ang khan i suktliekpêk ta sih a."
5,"For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.","Sa mur mura mi râlthuoma ân thuomna po po le, silfên thisen le inchiepawl niei nuoi po po chu, rawa meia ti ding el chau a ni sih a."
6,"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.","Ei ta dingin naupang a hung pieng a, naupa pêkin ei um tah a; rorêlna chu a liengkoah chuong a ta, a hminga chun Maka, Remruottu, Pathien Hrât, Chatuon Pa, Remna Lal an ti ding a ni sih a."
7,"Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.","David lalṭhungpha chunga le a ram chungah a rorêlna pungzie le inremnain tâwpintai nei naw nih, sukdet ding le tuta inthawka chatuon chen khawma rorêlna le felnaa tung- ding dingin. Sipaihai LALPA ṭha- hnemngaina chun chuong chu thâwng a tih."

9,"And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in stoutness of heart,","Chuongchun, mi po po, Ephraim- hai le Samaria um, chapotak le lungrila uongtaka,"
10,"The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone; the sycomores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.","“Ṭêkleihai chu chim sienla khawm, lungthîr sutin rem el ei tih; theichang thinghai chu sât bawngin um sienla khawm, sidar thinghaiin thleng el ei tih,” tituhai chun la hrieng an tih."
11,"Therefore Jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,","Chuleiin, LALPA chun Rezin dotuhai chu ama do dingin chawisâng a ta, a hmêlmahai chu chawktho a tih."
12,"the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.","Saktieng Suria mihai, thlang- tieng Philistin mihai chun bau kain Israelhai chu fa zo an tih. Chuong ang lâwma a thaw khawm chun a lunginsen chu a la bo chuong si nawh a; a kut chu a lân let ta rawp a."
13,"Yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them, neither have they sought Jehovah of hosts.","Nisienlakhawm, mihai chun anni vawtu tieng chu an ngha chuong si nawh a, sipaihai LALPA chu an zawng chuong bawk nawh."
14,"Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.","Chuleiin, LALPA chun Israel- haia inthawk chun a lu le a mei, intûm kau le thielkuong ni khat thilah sawk tâwl a tih."

16,For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.,"Hieng mihai ṭhuoituhai hin an ṭhuoi suol hlak a nih, an iṭhuoihai chu sukbohmangin an um hlak a nih."
17,"Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.","Chuleiin, LALPA chu an tlang- vâlhai chungah lâwm naw nih a, an naufahrahai le hmeithaihai chu lunginsiet bawk naw nih; an rêngin Pathien inzâ naw mi le thil ṭha naw thawtu an ni vawng a, bau po po chun thu teplo a hril seng sih a. Chuong ang lâwma a thaw khawm chun a lunginsen chu a la bo chuong si nawh a, a kut chu a lân let ta rawp a."
18,"For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.","Rîtlona chu mei angin a chawk dur dur hlak sih a, buor le hlohling- neihai chu a kâng hmang hlak; anih, ramhnuoi thing bitna hmunahai chun a kâng dur dur a, a khu ân tung ngut ngut hlak."
19,Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spareth his brother.,"Sipaihai LALPA lunginsenna leiin ram chu a kâng siet a, mihai khawm chu meia ti ding thing ang an na; tukhawma mâni unau ngei khawm an hla nawh."
20,"And one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:","Chuongchun, miin an chang- tienga mi inchûng an ta, nisienla- khawm, an phîng la ṭâm ta rawp a ta, an vawitienga mi fâng an ta, nisien- lakhawm, tlai chuong naw ni hai, mi tinin mâni bân taksa fa seng an tih."
21,"Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.","Manassehaiin Ephraimhai fâng an ta, Ephraimhaiin Manassehai fâng an tih; chun, an pahni chun Judahai do hmunkhat an tih. Chuong ang lâwma a thaw khawm chun a lunginsen chu a bo si nawh a, a kut chu a lân let ta rawp a."
