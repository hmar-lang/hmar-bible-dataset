1,"My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;","Ka naupa, ka thuhai hi i pawm a, Nangmaa ka thupêkhai hi i siekhâwl a,"
2,"So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom, And apply thy heart to understanding;","Chuonga varna tienga i na chu i sit a, Hrietthiemna tienga i lungril chu i hmang chun;"
3,"Yea, if thou cry after discernment, And lift up thy voice for understanding;","Anih, ngairuotdikna chu i ko a, Hrietthiemna koa i râwl în suo bawk a,"
4,"If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures:","Tangka anga i zawng a, Ro phûm rûkhai anga i zawng suok chun;"
5,"Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, And find the knowledge of God.","LALPA ṭitna chu hung hre tâng i ta, Pathien hrietna chu hmu suok tâng i tih."
6,For Jehovah giveth wisdom; Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding:,LALPA chun varna a pêk sih a; A baua inthawk chun hrietna le hrietthiemna hung suok a tih.
7,He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;,Mi tluong ta ding chun varna hrisêl chu a siekhâwl a; Lungril ṭhataka fetuhai ta ding chun phaw a nih.
8,"That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.","Rorêlna lampuihai chu a vênghim theina ding le, A mi inthienghai lampui chu a vawngṭhatna dingin."
9,"Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, yea, every good path.","Chun, rorêlna le felna chu hung hrethiem tâng i ta, Thlierbîk nei nawna chu, anih, lampui ṭha tinrêng el le chun."
10,"For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;","Varna chu i lungrila chun hung lût a ta, I hringna ta ding chun hrietna chu inhawitina nîng a tih."
11,Discretion shall watch over thee; Understanding shall keep thee:,"Ngairuot thiemna chun nangma chu vêng a ti cheh a, Hrietthiemna chun kawl tlat a ti che;"
12,"To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak perverse things;","Mi rilo lampuia inthawka sansuok ding che le, Thil khawhlohai hriltuhaia inthawka sansuok ding chein;"
13,"Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;","Inthimna lampui hraw dinga, Felna lampuihai nghatsantuhaia inthawk le,"
14,"Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;","Rîtlona thaw kawnga hlimtuhai, Mi rilo khawhlonaa lâwm hlaktuhaia inthawk le,"
15,"Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:","An lampuihaia mi kâwihai, An lampuihai pêtsantuhaia inthawkin."
16,"To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;","Hmêlmak nuhmeia inthawka sansuok ding chein, A bâuthluma zaihlêmtu che, ram dang mi ngeia inthawk chun;"
17,"That forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God:","A tleirâwl lai ṭhien chu nghatsan a, A Pathien thuthlung theinghiltua inthawk chun."
18,"For her house inclineth unto death, And her paths unto the dead;","A in chun thina chu ân nghâi zing a, A lampuihai chu thinaah:"
19,"None that go unto her return again, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:","A mânu kuoma fetu chu tukhawm an hung kîr nâwk ta nawh a, Hringna lampuihai khawm chu an pâw phâk ngai bawk nawh;"
20,"That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.","Mi ṭhahai lampui chu i hraw theina ding le, Mi fel lampuihai chu i hraw theina dingin."
21,"For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the perfect shall remain in it.","Mi tluong chu rama chun chêng a ta, Mi ṭha famkim chu a um zing ding a ni sih a."
22,"But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.","Nisienlakhawm, mi khawhlo chu rama inthawka sât thlâk nîng a ta, Bawsetuhai chu amaa inthawk chun zunga phawi hmangin um an tih."
