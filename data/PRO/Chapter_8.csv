verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?","Varna chu a khêkin, Hrietthiemna chun a râwl ân suo a ni naw am a nih?"
2,"On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;","Lampui sîra hmun insânghaia chun, Lampui ṭhuom laihaia chun a ngîr a;"
3,"Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:","Khawpui lûtnaa, dâikawtkhâr sîrahai, Kawtkhâr lûtnaahai chun a khêk rak rak a;"
4,"Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men.","“In kuomah, aw mihriemhai, ka khêk a, Ka râwl chu mihriem naupahai kuomah kân suo a nih."
5,"O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.","Aw nang mi mâwl, varna hung hrethiem ta la, Chun, nangni invêthai, hriet- thiemna lungril hung nei ro."
6,"Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things.","Ngai ta u, thil ṭha bîkhai ka hril ding a ni sih a, Ka hmûrhai kâkna chu thil indik a ni ding a nih."
7,For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.,"Ka bau chun thudik sâksuok a ta, Khawhlona chu ka hmûrhai ta dingin tirdakum a ni sih a."
8,All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.,"Ka baua thu po pohai chu felna a na, Annia chun a kâwi amanih, a khêl amani khawm a um nawh."
9,"They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.","A hrethiemtu ta ding chun a fie vawng a, Hrietna hmu suoktuhai ta ding chun ân dik vawng bawk a nih."
10,"Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.","Tangka ni loin, ka inchûktirna hi lo pawm ro, Rangkachak ditumtak nêkin hrietna chu lo chang bawk unla."
11,For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.,Lunghluhai nêkin varna chu a ṭha lem sih a; Thil po po dit thei taphawthai chu ama le hrilkhi ding a um nawh.
12,"I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge and discretion.","Kei varna hin varna chu ka chêngnaah ka hmang a, Hrietna le ngairuotthiemna chu ka hmu suok a."
13,"The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate.","LALPA ṭi chu suolna theidana ding a na, Chapona le, insuklienna le rîtlona kawng leh, Bau chapo hi ka theida a nih."
14,"Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.","Thurâwnna chu ka ta a na, hrietna hrisêl leh, Hrethiemin ka um a, thilthawtheina ka nei a nih."
15,"By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.","Lalhaiin keimain ro an rêl a, Lal nauhai chun keimain rorêl dik chu an sukthlûk bawk a."
16,"By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.","Rorêltuhai chun keimain ro an rêl a, Mi ṭhahai le, hnuoi chunga rorêltuhai po po chun."
17,I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me.,"A mi hmangaituhai chu ka hmangai veh a, Chun, nguntaka a mi zawngtuhai chun mi hmu suok bawk an tih."
18,"Riches and honor are with me; Yea, durable wealth and righteousness.","Hausakna le inzâkaina chu ka kuomah a um a, Hausaknahai le felna tlotak el chu."
19,"My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.","Ka ra chu rângkachak nêkin, anih, rângkachak inthieng nêkin a ṭha lem a, Ka pungna khawm chu tangka ditumtak nêkin a ṭha lem."
20,"I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;","Felna lampuia chun ka feh a, Rorêlna lampuitakhaia chun."
21,"That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.","Kei a mi hmangaituhai chu thil nei dinga ka siem theina ding le, An sum inhai chu ka suksip theina dingin."
22,"Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.","LALPA chun a lampui inṭanna angin a mi siem a, Inhmata a sinthawhai hmasatak angin."
23,"I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.","Atîra inthawk, chatuona indinin ka um a, Hnuoi hrim la um hmain."
24,"When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.","Tuipuihai a um naw laiin lâk suokin ka um a, Tuikhurhai tuia sipa umhai um naw lai chun."
25,"Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;","Tlânghai siemrêl an ni hmain, Muolhai hma daiin, lâk suok ka ni tah a;"
26,"While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.","Ramhai le hnuoi a la siem naw lai le, Khawvêl pilvut inṭan hma dai bawk chun."
27,"When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,","Vânhai chu a buotsai lai chun, chutaka chun ka um a, Tuipui chung inkuol a siem lai chun;"
28,"When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,","Vâna sûmhai a siem laiin, Tuipui tuikhurhai chu a sukdet lai chun."
29,"When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;","Chuong lai chun tuipui ta dingin tiemchin a pêk a, Tuihai chun a thupêk chu an bawsiet nawna dingin, Leihnuoi lungphûmhai chu a ruot lai chun:"
30,"Then I was by him, as a master workman; And I was daily his delight, Rejoicing always before him,","Chuong lai chun amaa chun sinthaw hotu ang ka lo ni tah a; Chun, ama hmaa chun hlima um rawpin, Ni tina a lâwmna chu ka lo ni tah a."
31,Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men.,"A leihnuoi chêng theinaa chun hlima umin, Ka lâwmna chu mihriem nau- pahai chungah a ni tah a."
32,"Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways.","Chuleiin, tuhin, ka naupa- salhai mi lo ngai unla, Ka lampui hrawtuhai chu mi hamṭha an ni sih a."
33,"Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.","Inchûktirna chu ngai unla, var unla, Dit naw hrim hrim naw ro."
34,"Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.","Ka thu hretu chu mi hamṭha a nih, Ka dâikawtkhâra ni tina nghâktu, Ka kawtkhâr bienga nghâk zingtu chu."
35,"For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah.","Tukhawm a mi hmu suoktu chun hringna chu a hmu suok a, LALPA ditsakna chu chang a tih."
36,But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.,"Amiruokchu, ka chunga suksuol chun ama lungril ngei a sukkhawhlo a, Kei a mi theidatuhai po po chun thina an hmangai a nih.”"
