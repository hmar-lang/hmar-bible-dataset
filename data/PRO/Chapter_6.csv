1,"My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;","Ka naupa, i tuolbâwm ta dinga aiawtu i nih a, Hmêlmak mi ta dinga i kuthai i ben chun,"
2,"Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.",I baua thuhai ngei chun âwk i na; I baua thuhai ngei chun man i ni tah.
3,"Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;","Tuhin hi hi thaw la, ka naupa, nangma le nangma chu insansuok rawh, I tuolbâwm kuta chun i lût a ni ta sih a; Fe la, nang le nang chu insukhnuoi la, i tuolbâwm chu ngên rawh."
4,"Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids;","I mithai chu inna inhmutir naw la, I mitkhohai chu ininnghiltir bawk naw rawh."
5,"Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.","Ramsuoktu kuta sakhi a suok angin le, Vate vêtua inthawka vate a suok ang elin, Nang le nangma chu insansuok rawh."

8,"Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest.","Nipui lai a bu a siekhâwl a, Busîk hunah a bu a lâk khâwm hlak."
9,"How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?","Aw thabo, ieng chen am i zâl ding a na? I zâlnaa inthawkin iengtik âm i tho ding a na?"
10,"Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:","Zâl dep bêk, in dep bêk, Zâla kuthai hang thlep dep bêk."
11,"So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man.","Chuongchun, inru angin i pasietna chu hung a ta, I tlâksamna chu mi râlthuoma inthuom angin hung a tih."
12,"A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;","Mi hmangna bo, mi khawhlo, Bau chapotakin a lêng a."
13,"That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers;","A mithai a sêp a, a kehaiin thu a hril a, A kuthaiin inchiknahai ân chûktir a."
14,"In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord.","A lungrila chun kâwmâwna a um a, thilsuol a rawt suok rawp a, Indarna a tu hlak."

16,"There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:","Thil paruk LALPAIN a theidahai chu a um a, Anih, pasari, chuong chu ama ta dingin tirdakum an nih;"
17,"Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;","Mit mengsânghai, lei khêlhlip, Pawitâwklo thisen insuoktir hlak kuthai le chun,"
18,"A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,","Ngaituona suol ngairuot hlak lungril le, Pawi tâwk dinga ke tlân hrât hlakhai leh;"
19,"A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.","Hrietpuitu indiklo khêlthu sâksuok hlaktu, Unauhai laia indarna tu hlaktu le chun."

32,He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.,"Nuhmei le uiretna thil thawtu chu lungril bo a na, Ama lungril ngei sukse dingin thil a thaw a nih."
33,Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away.,"Inhliemna le hmaimâwkna hmûng a ta, A hmaimâwkna chu hrûk hmang ni naw nih."
34,For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.,"Itthîkna hi mihriem lungsenna a na, Phubalâk ni chun hla naw nih."
35,"He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.","Intlanna hrim hrim ngaisak naw nih a, Thilpêk tamtakhai chu pe la khawm, lungawi el chuong naw nih."
