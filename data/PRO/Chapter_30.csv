1,"The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the oracle. The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:","Jake naupa Agur thuhai chu: thuvar chu. Mi chun Ithiel kuomah a hril a, Ithiel le Ukal kuoma chun: “Aw Pathien, kei le kei kân nghawk a,"

4,"Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in his garment? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou knowest?","Tu am vâna chun a hang lâwnin a hung ṭum leh? Tuin am a kuttum sûngah thli chu a siekhâwl hlak a? Tuin am a silfênin tuihai chu a ting hlak a? Tuin am hnuoi kil tâwphai po po chu a tungding a? A hming ieng am a na, a naupa hming khawm ieng am a na, i hriet am?”"

7,Two things have I asked of thee; Deny me them not before I die:,"Thil pahni ka hni cheh a, Ka thi hma hin mi hung inphatpêk tâwl naw rawh."
8,Remove far from me falsehood and lies; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is needful for me:,"Keimaa inthawka hlatakah teplo nina le khêlhlipna hi sawnhmang la, Hausakna amanih, pasietna amani khawm mi pe naw rawh; Keia ta dinga pawimaw bu chun mi châwm lem rawh."
9,"Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is Jehovah? Or lest I be poor, and steal, And use profanely the name of my God.","Ka hung tlai hin inphat ka ti cheh a “LALPA chu tu am a na?” ti hlau rawi ka tih, Annawleh, ka hung pasiet hin inru rawi ka ta, Ka Pathien hming hi hrilsiet- nain hmang rawi ka tih."

11,"There is a generation that curse their father, And bless not their mother.","Thla pakhat an thlatuhai hrilse hlak chu an um a, An nuhai khawm chu mal an sâwm bawk nawh."
12,"There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, And yet are not washed from their filthiness.","Thla pakhat anni mithmua inthieng chu an um a, Anni chu an tirdakumnaa inthawka lân sâwpfai lo an nih."
13,"There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.","Thla pakhat an um a, aw an mithai chu a vân sâng ngei de! An mit vunhai chu a tungin ân hlîm a."
14,"There is a generation whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.","Thla pakhat an hahai kâwlhnâm ang le, an ha hnuoihai chemtêhai ang el chu an um a, Mihriem laia mi tlasamhai le hnuoia inthawka mi pasiehai chu fa zo ding elin."
15,"The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, Yea, four that say not, Enough:","Lît chun naunuhmei pahni “Mi pe, mi pe” tiha khêk khêkhai chu a nei a, Thil pathum khawptâwk ngai hrim hrim lo chu an um a, Anih, pali “A huntâwk” ti ngailohai chu an um a."
16,"Sheol; and the barren womb; The earth that is not satisfied with water; And the fire that saith not, Enough.","Thlân le, sul ching chu: Hnuoi, tuia tlai zo ngai lo, Chun, mei “A huntâwk,” ti ngai der lo chu."
17,"The eye that mocketh at his father, And despiseth to obey his mother, The ravens of the valley shall pick it out, And the young eagles shall eat it.","Mit a pa chu nuisan a, A nu thu awi dinga hmusittu chu, Phairuom vaâkhai chun kheldawk an ta; Mulukawlhai chun fâng an tih."
18,"There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yea, four which I know not:","Keia ta dinga thil mak taluo pathum an um a, Anih, pali ka hriet lohai chu;"
19,The way of an eagle in the air; The way of a serpent upon a rock; The way of a ship in the midst of the sea; And the way of a man with a maiden.,"Boruoka muvânlai lampui chu; Lungpui chunga rûlpui lampui chu; Tuisuoriet laia lawng lampui chu; Chun, pasal le nunghâk lampui le chun."
20,"So is the way of an adulterous woman; She eateth, and wipeth her mouth, And saith, I have done no wickedness.","Nuhmei uire lampui khawm chuong ang bawk chu a na, A fâk a, a hmûr chu a hrûk a, “Thil suol ka thaw nawh,” a ti nâwk a."
21,"For three things the earth doth tremble, And for four, which it cannot bear:","Leihnuoi hi thil pathum leiin ân thin hlak a, Chun, pali, a tuor zo naw chu a um a."

25,"The ants are a people not strong, Yet they provide their food in the summer;","Phaivânghai hi a pâwlpui an ni veh a, hrât lotak, Nipui sûngin an bu an siekhawl."
26,"The conies are but a feeble folk, Yet make they their houses in the rocks;","Zupui hi a ruol hrât lotak an na, Anachu, an inhai chu lungpuihaia chun an siem."
27,"The locusts have no king, Yet go they forth all of them by bands;","Khâuṭhikṭhihai hin lal an nei nawh a, Anachu, an rêngin a pâwlin an fe suok."

29,"There are three things which are stately in their march, Yea, four which are stately in going:","Thil pathum an fenaa pângngai zing an um a, Anih, pali, fenaa danglam lo an um a."
30,"The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, And turneth not away for any;","Sakeibaknei, ramsa po po laia thilthawtheitak chu, Thil ieng ding khawmin a pêt ngai nawh a,"
31,The greyhound; the he-goat also; And the king against whom there is no rising up.,"Uithiem; Sakêl khawm; Chun, lal a sipaihai le um chu."
32,"If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, Or if thou hast thought evil, Lay thy hand upon thy mouth.","Nangma chu în chawisânga invêttaka i thaw chun, Annawleh, thil suol dâm chu i ngaituo chun; I kut chun i bau hip rawh."
33,"For the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood; So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.","Bâwng nenetui sâwr chun bâwng nene thau a hung lâk suok a, Chun, hnâr hmet chun thisen a hung lâk suok a; Chuongchun, lunginsenna suktho chun inkhingna a hung lâk suok."
