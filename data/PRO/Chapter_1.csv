1,"The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:","Israel lal, David naupa Solomon thuvarhai chu:"
2,To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;,Varna le inchûktirna hre dingin; Hrietthiemna thuhai hre dingin
3,"To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;","Thilthaw vara inchûktirna dawng dingin, Felnaa le rorêlnaa le thlierbîk nei lonaa leh;"
4,"To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:","Mi mâwl kuoma varna pe ding le, Tlangvâl kuoma hrietna le ngairuotthiemna pe dingin,"
5,"That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:","Mi var chun a hriet a, thiemnaa chun a belsa theina ding le, Hrietthiemna nei mi chun rorêlna ṭhahai chu a changna dingin;"
6,"To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.","Thuvar le tekhithu hrethiem ding le, Mi var thuhai le an thuril hrilhai chu hrethiem dingin."
7,The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.,"LALPA ṭina chu hrietna bul a nih: Amiruokchu, invêt chun varna le inchûktirna chu an hmu- sit a."
8,"My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:","Ka naupa, i pa inchûktirna hi ngai la, I nu inchûktirna chu nghatsan naw rawh;"
9,"For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.","I lua chun pâr ṭhi mawitak nîng an ta, I rîng vêla chun ṭhi ang an ni ding a ni sih a."
10,"My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.","Ka naupa, mi suolhaiin an thlêm che chun Remtipui el naw rawh."
11,"If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;","Hienghin ti sien khawm, “Keini leh hung la, Thisen inchân ei ta, A san um loin mi pawitâwk- lo chu inrûkin inchân ei ta;"
12,"Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;","Seol ang elin an hring pumin lem ei ta; Mi felhai ngei chu, vânsama fethlahai ang elin;"
13,We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;,"Thil hluhai po po chu hmûng ei ta, Ei inhai chu râllâk thilin suksip ei ta;"
14,Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:,"I chanpuol chu keini lai sielût ve la, Ei rêngin sumbâwm khat ei nei ding annâwm” tiin."
15,"My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:","Ka naupa, anni chu lampuia chun intlawnpui naw la, An lampuia inthawk chun i ke chu vêng ṭha rawh."
16,"For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.","An kehai chu rîtlona tieng a tlân a, Thisen insuo dingin an inhmaw sih a."
17,For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:,Vate hrim hrim mithmua lên keiphar chu; A thlâwn el a ni sih a.
18,And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives.,"Chun, chuong anni thisen ngei inchântuhai chun, Anni hringna ngei chu inrûkin an inchân a nih."
19,So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.,Hlêpnaa duâm mi taphawthai lampui chu chuong ang chu a nih; A neituhai hringna chu a lâk hmang hlak.
20,Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;,Varna chu kawtthlêra chun inringtakin a khêk a; Khawlaiahai chun a râwl chu ân suoh a.
21,"She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:","Kawtthlêr inrîk mur murna hmun takhaia chun a khêk a, Dâi kawtkhâr lûtnaa dâm chun. Khawpui sûnga chun a thuhai chu a hril a."
22,"How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?","Ieng chen am nangni mi mâwlhai, mâwlna hi in hmangai ding a na? Hmusittuhai chu an hmusitnaa chun an lâwmin, Invêthai chun ieng chen am hrietna chu in theida ding a na?"
23,"Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.","Ka kâwknaa hin nghakîr unla, Ngai ta u, in kuoma chun ka thlarau chu hung buok ka ta, Ka thuhai chu in kuomah inhriettir ka ti cheu."
24,"Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;","Ka ko cheu a, in ngaisak nawh a, Ka bân ka pharsuok a, tu- khawma in ngaisak nawh a,"
25,"But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:","Ka thurâwn chu iengkhawm loah in siem a, Ka kâwkna a ieng khawm chu in ngai naw leiin,"
26,I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;,"Kei khawm in lunginzing nia chun innui ka ta, In ṭitna hung pha khawm chun nuisan ka tih,"
27,"When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.","In ṭitna chu thlipui angin, In lunginzîngna chu thlivir angin a hung a, Rimsikna le tuorna chu in chungah a tlung pha chun;"
28,"Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:","Chun, kei chu mi hung ko an ta, nisienlakhawm, dawn naw ningah; Nguntakin mi hung zawng an ta, nisienlakhawm, mi hmu naw hi hai."
29,"For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,","Hrietna chu an theidah a, LALPA ṭîna chu an thlang nawh a,"
30,"They would none of my counsel, They despised all my reproof.","Ka thurâwn a ieng ieng khawm an zâwm nawh a, Ka kâwkna po po chu an hmusit a,"
31,"Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.","Chuleiin, anni lampui rasuok ngei chu fâng an ta, An thiltumhai ngeia suksip ni tâng an tih."
32,"For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.","Mi mâwl hnungtawlna chun anni chu sukhlum a ta, Invêthai nuomsakbâwlna chun anni chu a suksiet ding a ni sih a."
33,"But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.","Amiruokchu, tukhawm keia thu ngai chu himtakin chêng a ta, Rîtlona ṭi dêr loin um ṭawk ṭawk a tih."
