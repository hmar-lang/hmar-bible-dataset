1,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.",Chuong thil hnunga chun Aigupta lal uoin petu le a bei siemtu chun an pu Aigupta lal chu an suklungninawh a.
2,"And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.","Chuongchun, Pharao chu a siehlaw pahni, a uoin pe hotu tak le, a bei siem hotu tak chunga chun a lunginsen tah a."
3,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.","Chuongchun vêngtu pâwl hotu inah, intângna in, Josef khuopa a umnaa chun, ân tângtir tah a."
4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.","Vêngtu pâwl hotu chun Josef chu anni ân enkawltir a: chuongchun, ama chun anni chu a nghâk a, an rawng a bâwl tah a: chun, ni iengzat lai amanih an intâng phawt a."
5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.","Chun, intângna ina khuopa um, Aigupta lal uoin petu le bei siemtu chun, an pahniin zân khatah mang umze tum ve ve an nei a."
6,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.","A zînga zîngkâr chun Josef chu an kuomah a va lût a, anni chu lungngai hmêl deuin a va hmuh a."
7,"And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in ward in his master’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?","Chun, ama chun, “Iem a tiha vawisûn chu lungngai hmêl in va put de?” tiin, Pharao siehlaw hotuhai, a pu ina ama kuoma intâng vehai chu ân dawn a."
8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Mang kan nei a, a mi hrilfie thei tukhawm an um si nawha a nih,” an tih a. Josef chun an kuomah, “Mang hrilfienahai chu Pathien ta a ni naw am a nih? Lunginsiettakin mi hang hril ta u,” a tih a."
9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;","Chuongchun, uoin pe hotu tak chun a mang chu Josef a hril a, a kuomah, “Ka manga chun ka hmaa hin grêp hrui a lo um a,"
10,"and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:","grêp hruia chun a kau pathum a um bawk a; chun, inder suok angin a lo um a, pârhai a lo hung suok a: a pâr bâwrhai chun grêp hminhai a hung insuo tah a."
11,"and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.","Chun, Pharao no chu ka kuta hin a lo um a; chuongchun, grêp rahai chu ka lo a, Pharao noa chun ka sâwr a, no chu Pharao kutah ka lo pêk a,” a tih a."
12,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;","Josef chun a kuomah, “Hi hi a hrilfiena a nih: a kau pathum chu ni thum a nih."
13,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.","Tuta inthawk ni thuma chun Pharaoin i lu dawm kâng a ta, i sinthaw chu inthawtir nâwk a ti che: chuongchun, a uoin petu i ni laia i pêk dân pângngai ang khan Pharao no chu a kutah i pêk nâwk ding a ni chu."
14,"But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:","Amiruokchu, i chan ṭhat nâwk pha chun mi hung hre zing la, lungin- siettakin lunginsietna ka chungah hung inlangtir la, Pharao kuomah ka chanchin hung hril la, hi ina inthawk hin mi ṭhuoi suok rawh."
15,for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.,"Hebrai mihai rama inthawka miin ân rûka an mîn rûk hmang ka nih a, hi rama khawm hin rip sûnga an mi khumna khawp iengkhawm ka suksuol nawh,” a tih a."
16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:","Bei siemtu chun hrilfiena chu a ṭha ti a hrietin Josef kuomah, “Kei khawm mang ka nei a, bei vâr leikhâwr pathumin ka lo sipsuon a;"
17,and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.,"chun, leikhâwr chunghnung taka chun Pharao bu, beisiemtuin a siem, chi tinrêng hi a lo um a; chuong chu vatehaiin ka leikhawr sîpsuona inthawk chun an lo fâk mur mur a,” a tih a."
18,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;","Josef chun a dawn a, “Hi hi a hrilfiena a nih: leikhâwr pathum chu ni thum a nih;"
19,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.","tuta inthawka ni thuma chun Pharaoin i tisaa inthawkin i lu chu dawm kâng a ta, thing lêrah khai a ti che; chuongchun, vatehaiin i sa chu an fâk mur mur ding a ni chu,” a tih a."
20,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.","Chun, ni thum ni, Pharao pieng champhaphâk ni chun, Pharaoin ama siehlaw po pohai ta dingin ruoi a ṭheh a; chun, a siehlawhai laia mi uoin pe hotu tak le bei siem hotu tak lu chu a dawm kâng tah a."
21,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:,"Uoin pe hotu tak chu uoin pe hotuah ân ṭhangtir nâwk a; chuong- chun, no chu Pharao kuta chun a pêk tah a;"
22,but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.,"bei siem hotu tak ruok chu a khai tah a, Josefin an kuoma a hrilfie ang tak el khan."
23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.","Nisienlakhawm, uoin pe hotu tak chun Josef chu a hriet zing awzâwng ta nawh a, a theinghil tah a."
