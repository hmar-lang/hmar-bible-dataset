1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.","Chun, kum hni zet hnungah Pharao chun mang a nei a: Nile vadung panga hin a lo ngir a."
2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.","Bâwngpui pasari naltak tak, thâutak tak tuia inthawka hung suok a, phairuong laia tla hi a hmuh a."
3,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.","Chun, bâwngpui dang pasari ber- tak tak, chêrtak tak hi tuia inthawk bawka an hnunga hung suok ve chu a hmuh a, bâwngpui danghai kâwlah vadung panga chun an lo ngîr a."
4,And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.,"Chun, bâwngpui bertak tak, chêrtak tak chun bâwngpui naltak tak, thâutak tak chu an fâk zo el tah a. Chun, Pharao chu a ṭhang tah a."
5,"And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good.","Chun, a hang in nâwk a, mang a nei nâwk chun, bu kûng khata hin vui sari lientak tak, ṭhatak tak an hung suok a."
6,"And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.",Chu hnunga chun vui sari chitê te khawsak thliin a mût ṭâwl bir berhai chu an hung suok nâwk a.
7,"And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.","Chun, vui chitê têhai chun vui sari lientak tak, ṭhatak takhai chu an lem zo el tah a. Chun, Pharao chu a ṭhang a, a mang a lo ni zing el ti a hriet a."
8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.","Chun, zîngtieng chun a lungin- zîng ta hle el a; chuongchun, mi a tir a, Aigupta rama mitvaidawithiem po po le mivar po po chu a ko a; Pharao chun a mang chu a lo hril tâwl a: nisienlakhawm, Pharao hrilfie thei tukhawm an um nawh a."
9,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:","Chun, uoin pe hotu tak chun Pharao kuomah, “Vawisûn hin ka suksuolzie ka hriet suok tah:"
10,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:","Pharao a siehlawhai chungah a lunginsen a, vêngtu pâwl hotu ina chun kei le bei siem hotu tak chu a mîn tângtir a;"
11,"and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.","Chun, kei le ama chun zân khatah mang kan nei a, mang umze tum ve ve a nih kan nei chu."
12,"And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.","Chutaka chun kan kuoma vêngtu pâwl hotu siehlaw, Hebrai mi, tlangvâl pakhat a um a: ama chu kan hril a, ama chun kan manghai chu a mi hrilfie tah a, kan mang ang dungzui pei chun a mi hrilfiepêk ve veh a."
13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.","Chun, a mi hrilfie ang tak chun a hung um ta ngei a nih: kei chu ka sinthaw hi a mîn thawtir nâwk a, ama chu a khaihlum tah a,” a tih a."
14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.","Chuongchun, Pharao chun Josef chu ân kotir nghâl tah a, inhmawtakin ripa inthawk chun an ṭhuoi suok tah a; chun, ama chu ânvaw fai a, a silfên chu a thleng a, Pharao kuomah a hung lût a."
15,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.","Chun, Pharao chun Josef kuomah, “Mang ka nei a, a hrilfie thei tukhawm an um nawh a, nangin mang hi a thu i hriet chun i hrilfie thei ti i chanchin mi hril ka lo hriet a,” a tih a."
16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.","Josef chun Pharao chu a dawn a, “Chu chu keimaa um a ni nawh a, Pathienin Pharao chu thlamuong- thlâktakin dawn lem a tih,” a tih a."
17,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:","Chun, Pharaoin Josef kuomah, “Ngai ta, ka manga chun Nile vapanga hin ka lo ngîr a,"
18,"and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:","bâwngpui pasari naltak tak, thâutak tak hi tuia inthawk chun an hung suok a, phairuong lai hin an lo tlah a:"
19,"and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:","chun, bâwngpui dang pasari bertak tak, chêrtak tak le inthirtak tak, chuong ang hrima sie Aigupta ram po poa khawm ka la hmu ngai naw hi, an hnungah an hung suok veh a;"
20,and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:,"chun, bâwngpui bertak tak, chêrtak takhai chun bâwngpui pasari thâutak tak hung suok hmasahai chu an fâk zo el tah a."
21,"and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.","Amiruokchu, an fâk zo hnung khawm chun tu khawma an fâk ti an hriet chuong nawh, a phuta ang bawk khan an la ber zing a. Chun, ka ṭhang tah a."
22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:","Chun, ka manga chun bu kûng khata vui sari lientak tak, ṭhatak tak hung suok ka hmu bawk a;"
23,"and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:","chu hnunga chun vui sari vuoi sil sel, chite te, khawsak thli imût ṭâwl bir ber hi an hung suok nâwk a:"
24,and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.,"chun, vui chite tehai chun vui sari ṭhatak takhai chu an lem zo el tah a. Chun, mitvaidawithiemhai chu ka hril a, nisienlakhawm, a mi hrilfie thei tukhawm an um si nawh a,” tiin a hril a."
25,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.","Chun, Josef chun Pharao kuom- ah, “Pharao mang hi thuhmun a nih: Pathienin a thilthaw ding Pharao ân hriettir a ni chu."
26,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.,"Bâwngpui pasari ṭhatak takhai chu kum sari an nih, bu vui sari ṭhatak takhai khawm chu kum sari an ni bawk a; mang chu thuhmun a nih."
27,"And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine.","An hnunga bâwngpui pasari bertak tak, chêrtak tak hung suokhai chu kum sari an nih; bu vui sari a si ruok khawsak thli imût ṭâwl bir berhai khawm chu: chuong chu ṭâm kum, kum sari ding a nih."
28,That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh.,Chu chu a nih Pharao kuoma ka hril kha: Pathienin a thilthaw ding Pharao ân hriettir a ni hi.
29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:",Aigupta ram sûng po poa hin hausakna nasatak kum sari a hung tlung ding a nih;
30,and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;,"chu hnunga chun ṭâm kum, kum sari hung um nâwk a tih, chuongchun, hausakna po po kha Aigupta rama hin theinghil vawng ni tâng a tih; ṭâm chun ram hi fa se zo a tih:"
31,and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.,"hausakna kha a zuitu ṭâm lei chun hi rama hin hre ta naw ni hai, a nasa hle ding a ni sih a."
32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.","Chun, Pharao mang ân nei nawntirna che chu hi lei hi a nih, thil thaw ding chu Pathienin a sukdet a, Pathien bawkin ân tlungtir vak ding leiin."
33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.","Chuleiin, tuhin Pharao chun mi pakhat vartak, bengvârtak zawng suok sienla, Aigupta ram chunga hin hotuah inumtir raw se."
34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.","Pharaoin chu chu thaw sienla; chun, ram chunga hin hotuhai ruot sienla, hausak kum, kum sari sûng chun Aigupta ram bu hi hmun ngaa ṭheha hmun khat pei la khâwm raw hai se."
35,"And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.","Anni chun chuong kum ṭhat kum hung tlung dinga bu po po chu Pharao thuneinain la khâwmin, fâk dingin khuoahai sung khâwmin vawng ṭha raw hai se."
36,"And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.","Chuongchun, ṭâm leia ram hi a bohmang nawna dingin, bu chu ṭâm kum, kum sari, Aigupta rama hung tlung ding sûnga ding chun, hi ram ta ding hin inringlâwkna ding nîng a tih,” a tih a."
37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.",Chu thu chu Pharao le a sie- hlawhai po po chun ṭha an ti zâwng tak a nih a.
38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?","Chun, Pharao chun a siehlaw- hai kuomah, “Hieng ang, Pathien thlarau umna mi hi, ei hmu zo ding am a nih?” a tih a."
39,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:","Pharao bawk chun Josef kuom- ah, “Pathienin chuong po po chu ân hriettir che leiin, nang anga bengvâr le var hrim hi an um nawh:"
40,"thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.","nang hi ka sûnghai chunga hotuah um i ta, ka khuoletui po po i thu thuin um a tih: lalṭhungphaa ṭhung thua chau hin nanga nêkin inlal ka tih,” a tih a."
41,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.","Pharao bawk chun Josef kuomah, “En ta, Aigupta ram sûng po poa hin hotuah ka siem che,” a tih a."
42,"And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;","Chun, Pharaoin a kuta inthawkin a hming namna kutsebi chu a phawi a, Josef kutah ân buntir a, puon zai inhmia siem silfênhai ân hâktir bawk a, a rîngah rângkachak khaidiet ân hlîtir a;"
43,"and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.","Chun, a tawlailîr nei pahninaa chun ân chuongtir a, a hmaa chun, “Dingṭhaṭhuon ro,” tiin an khêk pei a; chuongchun, Aigupta ram po po chunga chun hotuah a siem tah a."
44,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.","Chun, Pharaoin Josef kuomah, “Kei Pharao ka nih, nanga thu naw chun Aigupta ram sûng po poa hin tukhawmin an kut amanih, an ke amanih inlet naw ni hai,” a tih a."
45,"And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.","Chun, Pharaoin Josef hmingah Zaphenath-paneah ân bûk a: On khaw thiempu Potiphera naunu Asenath chu nuhmeiah ân neitir bawk a. Chun, Josef chu a suok a, Aigupta ram chu a fang tah a."
46,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.","Josef chu Aigupta lal Pharao hmaa a ngîr laiin kum sâwmthum mi a nih. Chun, Josef chu Pharao kuoma inthawk chu a suok a, Aigupta ram po po chu a fang suok tah a."
47,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.,"Chun, kum ṭhat kum, kum sari sûng chun hnuoi chun hlâwktakin bu an suo hlak a."
48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.","Aigupta rama kum ṭhat kum, kum sari hung tlunga bu po po chu a lâk khâwm a, bu chu khuohaia chun a sung khâwm tah a; khaw tinah a vêl lova bu seng chu a sung khâwm pei a."
49,"And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.","Chuongchun, Josef chun bu chu tamtak, tuisuorieta phaiphin zâtin a sung khâwm rei rui el a, ân khi khawm chu a ma ta hiel a, inkhi sêng ruol a ni ta si nawh a."
50,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.","Ṭâm hung tlung hma chun Josef chun naupasal pahni a nei a, chuhai chu On khaw thiempu Potiphera naunu Asenath chun a neipêk a nih."
51,"And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, said he, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.","Josef chun a nau lutîr hminga chun Manasse a sak a, “Pathienin kân rimna po po le ka pa sûnghai chu a mîn theinghiltir ta sih a,” a tih a."
52,And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.,"Chun, a nau pahnina hminga chun Ephraim a sak a, “Pathienin ka rinum tuorna rama hin chi a mîn thlatir ta sih a,” a tih a."
53,"And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.","Kum ṭhat kum, kum sari, Aigupta rama hung tlung chu a hung bo tah a."
54,"And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.","Chun, ṭâm kum, kum sari chu Josef hril ang takin a hung tlung phut ve tah a: ram tinah ṭâm a hung tla tah a, Aigupta ram sûng poa ruok chun fâk ding a um a."
55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.","Aigupta rama mi po po chu an ṭâm phingleh Pharao kuomah fâk ding hniin an khêk a. Pharao chun Aigupta mi po po kuoma chun, “Josef kuomah fe unla, a hril taphawt cheu chu thaw ro,” a tih a."
56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.","Ṭâm chu ram po poa a hung tla phing chun Josef chun an sung khâwmna in po po chu a hawng a, Aigupta mihai kuoma chun a zawr a: Aigupta rama chun ṭâm chu a tla nasa hleh a."
57,"And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth.","Chun, hnuoi chung po poa ṭâm chu a tlâk nasat hle leiin ram tina mihai chu bu inchaw dingin Aiguptaa Josef kuoma chun an hung a."
