verse_no,en,hmr
1,And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.,"Chun, hnuoia mi po po chu ṭawng hmunkhat le thu hril dân hmunkhat an ni vawng a."
2,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.","Chun, hieng hi a na, khawsak tienga an insawn pei lai chun Sinar ramah phaizâwl an hmuh a; chutaka chun umhmun an khuor tah a."
3,"And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.","“Thaw ro, ṭêklei siem ei tiu, ṭhatakin rawng ei tiu,” an inti tâwl a. Chuongchun, lung aiah ṭêklei chu an siem a, lungchârna aiah lawnghnai an nei bawk a."
4,"And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.","Chun, “Thaw ro, khawpui siem ei ta, in insâng a sîpin vân tawng dingin bâwl bawk ei tiu a, ei hming sukthang ei tiu; chuong naw chun hnuoi chung po poa hin sukdarin um rawi ei tih,” an in tih a."
5,"And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.","Chun, LALPA chu mihriem nauhaiin khawpui le in insâng an siem vêl chu en dingin a zu ṭum a."
6,"And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.","Chun, LALPA chun, “Ngai ta u, mihai hi pumkhat an nih a, an rêngin ṭawng hmunkhat an nei bawk sih a; hi thil an thaw phut a ni hi; tuhin chu an thilthaw tum hrim hrim hi khappêk ruol ni ta naw ni hai."
7,"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.","Thaw ro, zu fêng ei tiu a, ṭawng an inhriettuo thei nawna dingin khutaka khun an ṭawng zu suk- tumpêk ei tiu,” a ta."
8,So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.,"Chuongchun, LALPAIN anni chu chutaka inthawk chun hnuoi chung po poa chun a sukdar tah a; chuongchun, an khaw siem khawm chu an tâwpsan tah a."
9,Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.,"Chuleichun, a hming chu Babel an tih a; LALPAIN chutaka chun hnuoia mi po po ṭawng chu a suktumpêk ta leiin: chutaka inthawk chun LALPAIN anni chu hnuoi chung po poa chun a sukdar ta bawk a."
10,"These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood:",Hienghai hi Sem thlahai chu an nih: Sem chu kum za mi a niin tui lêt hnung kum hni hnunga chun naupasal Arpaksad a nei a:
11,"and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.","Chun, Arpaksad a nei hnung chun Sem chu kum za nga a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
12,"And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah:",Arpaksad chun kum sâwmthum le panga a niin naupasal Selah a nei a:
13,"and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.","Selah a nei hnung chun Arpaksad chu kum za li le pathum a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
14,"And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:",Selah chun kum sâwmthum a niin naupasal Eber a nei a:
15,"and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.","Eber a nei hnung chun Selah chu kum za li le pathum a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
16,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:",Eber chun kum sâwmthum le pali a niin naupasal Peleg a nei a:
17,"and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.","Peleg a nei hnung chun Eber chu kum za li le sâwmthum a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
18,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:",Peleg chun kum sâwmthum a niin naupasal Reu a nei a:
19,"and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.","Reu a nei hnungin Peleg chu kum za hni le pakuo a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
20,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:",Reu chun kum sâwmthum le pahni a niin naupasal Serug a nei a:
21,"and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.","Serug a nei hnungin Reu chu kum za hni le pasari a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
22,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:",Serug chun kum sâwmthum a niin naupasal Nahor a nei a:
23,"and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.","Nahor a nei hnungin Serug chu kum za hni a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
24,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:",Nahor chun kum sâwmhni le pakuo a niin naupasal Tera a nei a:
25,"and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.","Tera a nei hnungin Nahor chu kum za khat le sâwm le pakuo a la dam a, naunuhmei le naupasalhai a nei nâwk a."
26,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.","Chun, Tera chun kum sâwmsari a niin naupasal Abram, Nahor le Haran a nei a."
27,"Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.","Chun, hienghai hi Tera thlahai chu an nih. Tera chun naupasal Abram, Nahor le Haran a nei a. Haran chun naupasal Lota a nei a."
28,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.","Haran chu a piengna rama Kaldaihai khuo Urah, a pa Tera hmaa chun a thih a."
29,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.","Chun, Abram le Nahor chun nuhmei an nei a; Abram nuhmei hming chu Sarai a na; Nahor nuhmei hming chu Milka le Iska pa Haran naunu Milka a nih."
30,And Sarai was barren; she had no child.,"Chun, Sarai chu a ching a, nau hrim a nei nawh a."
31,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.","Tera chun a naupa Abram le, a naupa naupasal (Haran naupa) Lota le, a mo, a naupa Abram nuhmei Sarai chu a ṭhuoi a; Kanaana fe dingin Kaldaihai khuo Ura inthawk chun an suok tlâng tah a; nisienlakhawm, Haran an hung tlung a, chutaka chun umhmun an khuor tah a."
32,And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.,"Tera dam sûng chu kum za hni le panga a nih; chun, Tera chu Harana chun a thi tah a."
