1,"And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.","Chun, Abraham chu a hung upa a, a hung tar ta hleh a; chun, LALPAIN Abraham chu thil iengkimah mal a sâwm tah a."
2,"And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:","Chun, Abraham chun a siehlaw, a in sûnga upa tak, a nei po po chunga thuneitu kuoma chun, “Lunginsiettakin i kut kha ka elpui hnuoiah rawl rawh;"
3,"and I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:","chuongchun, LALPA, vân Pathien le hnuoi Pathien chu sâlin, ka umna Kanaan mihai nunghâk laia mi hi ka naupa nuhmeia neipêk lo dingin, ṭawng kân khâmtir ding che a nih;"
4,"but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.","ka ram tieng, ka laibunghai laia fein, ka naupa Isak hi nuhmei i neipêk lem ding a nih,” a ta."
5,"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?","Siehlaw chun a kuomah, “Nuhmei chun hi ram tieng hin a mi zui nuom kher da el rawi mawh, i naupa hi i hung suokna ram tieng chun ka ṭhuoi kîr ding am nîng a ti?” a ta."
6,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.","Abraham chun a kuomah, “Ka naupa hi chutaka chun ṭhuoi kîr nâwk naw dingin fimkhur rawh."
7,"Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.","LALPA vân Pathien, ka pa ina inthawk le ka piengna rama in- thawka mi ṭhuoi suoktu le, a mi betu, ‘Hi ram hi i thlahai kuomah la pêng ka tih,’ tiha ka kuoma inkhâma hriltu chun, ama ngeiin vântirko chu i hmaah infetir a ta, chutaka inthawk chun ka naupa hi nuhmei i hung neipêk ding a nih."
8,"And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.","Chun, nuhmei chun a zui nuom naw che chun, ka kuoma i înkhâmna kawnga hin inthieng el i tih; ieng- khawm ni sien ka naupa hi chutaka chun i ṭhuoi kîr nâwk ding a ni nawh,” a tih a."
9,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter.","Chuongchun, siehlaw chun a kut chu a pu Abraham êlpui hnuoia chun a rawl a, chu thua chun a kuoma chun ân khâm tah a."
10,"And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master’s in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.","Chun, siehlaw chun a pu sanghâwngsei laia mi sanghâwngsei sâwm a ṭhuoi a, a pu thil ṭha tinrêng chawiin a suok tah a: chuongchun, a tho a, Mesopotamia rama Nahor-hai khuoa chun a fe tah a."
11,"And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.","Chun, zântienga nuhmei ruol tui chawi dinga an suok hun lai tak chun, khawhnâwmah tuisunsuo kâwla chun a sanghâwngseihai chu ân dingṭhaṭhuontir a."
12,"And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.","Chun, “Aw LALPA, ka pu Abraham Pathien, lunginsiettakin vawisûn hin mîn hlawtlingtir la, ka pu Abraham chunga chun lungin- sietna inlangtir rawh."
13,"Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water:","En ta, tuikhur kâwlah ka ngîr a, khuoa mihai naunuhmei ruol khawm tui chawi dingin an hung hi:"
14,"and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master.","chuongchun, hieng ang hin ni raw se, nunghâk tu kuoma khawm, ‘Lunginsiettakin ka dâwn dingin i tuibêl kha sukhnuoi raw khai,’ ka tih a; ‘Dâwn rawh, i sanghâwngseihai khawm dâwn ding pêng ka tih,’ titu taphawt chu, chu ngei chu i siehlaw Isak ta dinga i ruot chu ni raw se; chutaka chun ka pu chungah lunginsietna în entir ti hrieng ka tih,” a ta."
15,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.","Chun, a hril zo hmain, ngai ta, Abraham sangpa Nahor nuhmei Milka naupa Bethuel naunu Rebeka chu a liengkoa tuibêl putin a hung suok a."
16,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.","Chu nunghâk chu a hmêl a ṭha hleh a, nunghâk inthieng a nih a, pasal hrim hrimin an la pâwl ngai dêr nawh. Tuikhura chun a zu feh a, a tuibêl a thâl sip a, a hung tung tah a."
17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.","Chun, siehlaw chu ân tuokpui dingin a tlân a, “Lunginsiettakin i tuibêla tui kha tlâwmte mîn dâwntir raw khai,” a tih a."
18,"And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.","Ama chun, “Dâwn ta la, pu,” a ta; inhmâwtakin a tuibêl chu a kutah a dawm thlâk a, ân dâwntir tah a."
19,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.","Ama ân dâwntir zo chun, “I sanghâwngseihai khawm an dâwn khawp hmakhat chun chawi pei ka tih,” a ta."
20,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.","Chun, inhmâwtakin a tuibêl chu ran thlênga chun ân ruok a, tui chawi dingin tuisunsuo tieng chun a tlân nâwk a, a sanghâwngseihai po po ta ding chun a chawi ta pei a."
21,"And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.","A vân zinnaa chun LALPAIN ân hlâwtlingtir le tir naw hrietna dingin siehlaw chun amanu chu to ṭawkin a en zing a,"
22,"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,","sanghâwngseihai chun an dâwn khawp phingleh, siehlaw chun rângkachak hnâra inbûk duli bûk le, a kuta dingin bânbun pahni rângkachak tangka sâwm bûk a phawr a;"
23,"and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?","a kuomah, “Tu naunu am i nih a, lunginsiettakin mi hril ta. I pa inah kan riekna ding hmun um a ti?” a tih a."
24,"And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Nahor ta dinga nei Milka naupa Bethuel naunu ka nih,” a ta."
25,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.","Ama bawkin a kuomah “Bupâwl le ran bu kan hau ve veh a, riekna hmun khawm kan nei,” a ti nâwk a."
26,"And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah.","Chuongchun, siehlaw chun a lu a kûn a, LALPA chu chibai a bûk a."
27,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master: as for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my master’s brethren.","Chun, “Ka pu chunga a lunginsietna le a takna bo ngailo LALPA, ka pu Abraham Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se; kei khawm hi Lalpa chun ka pu unauhai in tieng a mi ṭhuoi a lo ni hi,” a tih a."
28,"And the damsel ran, and told her mother’s house according to these words.","Chun, nunghâk chu a tlân a, chuong thu chu a nu sûnghai a va hril a."
29,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.","Rebeka chun ṭapa a nei a, a hming chu Laban a nih: chuongchun, Laban chu a suok a, tuikhur tieng mi kuoma chun a va tlân a."
30,"And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.","Hnâra inbûk le a farnu kuta bânbunhai chu a hmuh a, “Mi chun chuong ang khâng ang chun a mi tih,” tiha a farnu Rebeka thu hril chu a hriet phingleh, mi kuoma chun a va feh a; chun, ngai ta, ama chu tuikhura sanghâwngseihai lai chun a lo ngîr zing a."
31,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.","Chun, Laban chun, “Nang LALPA malsâwmna dawngtu, hung lût rawh, iengdinga tuola i ngîr zing am? In le sanghâwngseihai ta ding hmun ka siemrêl tah a nih,” a ta."
32,"And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.","Chun, chu mipa chu ina chun a lût a, chun Laban chun sa- nghâwngseihai thuomhnaw chu a sût a; sanghâwngseihai ta ding chun bupâwl le ran bu a pêk a, a ke le a ruolhai ke sâwpna dingin tui a pêk bawk a."
33,"And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.","Chun, Abraham siehlaw hmaa chun fâk ding an hung pêk bawk a; nisienlakhawm, ama chun, “Ka hungna san thu ka hril hmakhat chun fa naw ning,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Hril ta la,” a tih a."
34,"And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.","Chun, ama chun, “Abraham siehlaw ka nih."
35,"And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses.","LALPA chun ka pu chu nasatakin mal a sâwm a, mi lientak a hung nih a. LALPA chun ama chu berâm ruol dâm, bâwng ruol dâm, tangka dâm, rângkachak dâm, suok- pa dâm, suoknu dâm, sanghâwng- seihai dâm, sabengtung dâm, a pêk bawk a."
36,And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.,Ka pu nuhmei Sara chun a tar hnungin ka pu ta dingin naupasal a nei a; ama kuoma chun a nei po po a pêk vawng a.
37,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:","Ka pu chun, ‘Ka umna rama Kanaan mihai nunghâk laia mi hi ka naupa nuhmeiah i neipêk ding a ni nawh:"
38,"but thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.","ka pa in tieng, ka laibunghai laia fein, ka naupa ta dingin nuhmei i neipêk lem ding a nih,’ tiin ṭawng a mîn khâmtir a."
39,"And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.","Keiin ka pu kuoma chun, ‘Nuhmei chun a mi zui nuom da el rawi mawh,’ ka tih a."
40,"And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun ka kuomah, ‘LALPA a hmaa ka um hlakna chun a vântirko chu i kuomah tir a ta, i fena dinga chun inhlâw- tlingtir a ti che; chuongchun, ka naupa ta dingin ka laibunghai le ka pa sûnghai laia mi nuhmeiah i neipêk ding a nih;"
41,"then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.","ka laibunghai kuom ngei i tlung pha chun în khâmnaa inthawk hin inthieng i tih, nunghâk chu an pêk naw che chun, ka kuoma în khâmnaa inthawk hin inthieng i tih,’ a tih a."
42,"And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:","Chuongchun, vawisûn hin tui- khur chu ka hung tlung a, ‘Aw LALPA, ka pu Abraham Pathien, ka fenaa hin i mîn hlâwtlingtir ding chun,"
43,"behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink;","en ta, tuikhur kâwlah ka ngîr hi: chun, hieng ang hin ni raw se, nunghâk tui chawi dinga hung suok tu kuoma khawm, “Lunginsiettakin dâwn dingin i tuibêla tui kha tlâwmte mi pe ta,” ka tih a:"
44,"and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master’s son.","Chun, amân, “Dâwn rawh, i sanghâwngseihai ta ding khawm hin chawi ka tih,” titu taphawt chu, chu ngei chu ka pu naupa ta dinga LALPA nuhmei ruot chu ni raw se,’ ka tih a."
45,"And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.","Chun, ka lungrila ka hril zo hma chun, ngai ta, Rebeka hi a tuibêl putin a hung suok a; chun, tuikhura chun a zu feh a, tui a zu chawi a; chun, a kuomah, ‘Lungin- siettakin tui mîn dâwntir ta khai,’ ka tih a."
46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.","Ama hin inhmawtakin a lieng- koa inthawk chun a tuibêl chu a dawm thlâk a, ‘Dâwn rawh, i sanghâwngseihai khawm hi dâwn ding pêng ka tih,’ a ta: chuongchun, ka dâwn a, sanghâwngseihai khawm ân dâwntir bawk a."
47,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.","Chun, keiin, ‘Tu naunu am i nih a?’ tiin kân dawn a. Ama chun, ‘Milka ineipêk Nahor naupa Bethuel naunu ka nih,’ a tih a; chun, hnâra inbûk chu a hnârah kân bûk a, bânbunhai chu a kutah kân buntir bawk a."
48,"And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.","Chun, ka lu ka kûn a, LALPA chu chibai ka bûk a, LALPA, ka pu Abraham Pathien, ka pu laibungpa naunu hi a naupa ta dinga nuhmeia neipêk dinga lampui indiktaka mi ṭhuoitu chu kân pâk bawk a."
49,"And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.","Chuongchun, tuhin, ka pu in lunginsiet a, a chungah thaw tak taka in thaw ding chun mi hril ro; in thaw naw ding khawmin mi hril bawk ro; chuongchun, ka thaw dân ding hre thei ka tih,” a ta."
50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.","Chun, Laban le Bethuel chun an dawn a, “Hi thil hi LALPAA inthawka suok a ni hi, a sie a ṭha khawm i kuomah kan hril thei nawh."
51,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.","En ta, Rebeka chu i hmaa hi a um annâwm, ṭhuoi la fe el rawh, LALPAIN a hril angin i pu naupa nuhmeiin um raw se,” an tih a."
52,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah.",Abraham siehlaw chun an thu chu a hriet phingleh hnuoi sikin LALPA chibai a bûk tah a.
53,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.","Chun, Abraham siehlaw chun tangkaruo incheinahai le, rângka- chak incheinahai le silfênhai a lâk suok a, Rebeka kuoma chun a pêk a; a ṭapa le a nu kuoma khawm chun thil hlutak takhai a pêk bawk a."
54,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.","Chun, ama le a ruolhai chun an fâkin an dâwn a, an riek tah a. Zîngkâra an tho chun, “Ka pu kuomah mîn fetir ta ro,” a tih a."
55,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.","A ṭapa le a nu chun, “Tawinu hi ni sâwt nawte, ni sâwm bêk kan kuomah um hri raw se; chu hnunga chun fe de nih,” an tih a."
56,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Mi sukhnu naw ro khai, LALPA chun ka fenaa hin a mîn hlâwtlingtir ta sih a: ka pu kuoma ka fe theina dingin mîn fetir el lem ro khai,” a ta."
57,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.","Anni chun, “Tawinu chu ko kan ta, ama bau ngeiah bieng kan tih,” an ta."
58,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.","Chuongchun, Rebeka chu an ko a, a kuomah, “Hi mipa kuoma hin fe nuom i ti?” an tih a. Ama chun, “Nuom e,” a ta."
59,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.","Chuongchun, an farnu Rebeka le, a dawntu le, Abraham siehlaw le a rawihai chu an infetir tah a."
60,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.","Chun, Rebeka chu mal an sâwm a, a kuomah, “Kan farnu, nang chu sîng ruoka sâng tamtak nu hung ni la, i thlahai chun anni theidatuhai kul kawtkhâr chu neipêk raw hai se,” an ta."
61,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.","Chuongchun, Rebeka chu a tho a, a suoknuhai leh sanghâwngseihai chunga chun an chuong a, mi chu an zui tah a; chuongchun, siehlaw chun Rebeka chu a ṭhuoi a, a fe tah a."
62,And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of the South.,"Chun, Isak chu Beer-lahai-roi tienga inthawk chun a hung a, Sim rama um a ni sih a."
63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.","Chun, Isak chu zântieng hin inngaituo dingin phûlah a va lêng suok a: chun, a hei nghah a, a en a; chun, ngai ta, sanghâwngseihai an hung a."
64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.","Chun, Rebeka chu a hang nghah a, Isak chu a hmu phingleh sanghâwngsei chunga inthawk chun a ṭum tah a."
65,"And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took her veil, and covered herself.","Abraham siehlaw kuoma chun, “Phûla a mi tuok dinga hung saw tu am a na?” a tih a. Siehlaw chun, “Ka pu a ni saw,” a ta: chuong- chun, ân khumna puon a lâk a, ân khum tah a."
66,And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.,"Chun, siehlaw chun a thilthaw po po chu Isak a hril a."
67,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.","Isak chun Rebeka chu a nu Sara puon ina chun a ṭhuoi lût a; chun, Rebeka chu a nei a, a nuhmei a hung ni tah a; chun, ama chu a hmangai hleh a, chuongchun, Isak chu a nu thi thua khawm chun a hung thlamuong thei tah a."
