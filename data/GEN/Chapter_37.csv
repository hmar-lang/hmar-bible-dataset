1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.",Jakob chu a pa khuolchâmna Kanaan rama chun a um tah a.
2,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father.","Hieng hi Jakob thlahai chu an nih: Josef chu kum sâwmpasari a niin a uhai, a pa nuhmeihai Bilha le Zilpah naupasalhai leh ran ruol an inthlah a. Josef chun an suol thukhawchâng chu a pa kuomah ân tlun a."
3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.","Chun, Israel chun Josef chu a tar tieng nau a ni leiin a nauhai po po nêk chun a hmangai lem a; chuongchun, zakawfuol rawng tamtaka ṭiel a siempêk a."
4,"And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.","An pa chun ama chu a uhai po po nêkin a hmangai lem ti a unauhaiin an hriet chun ama chu an theida ta hleh a, ṭawngbau ṭha hrim a chungah an rawl thei ta nawh a."
5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.","Chun, Josef chun mang a nei a, a uhai kuoma a hril chun ama chu an theida zuol tah a."
6,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:","Ama chun an kuomah, “Lungin- siettakin ka mang thu hi lo ngai ro:"
7,"for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.","ngai ta u, loa hin buphalhai ei lo intêl a, ngai ta u, ka buphal chu a hung tho a, a ngîr ta a; in buphalhai chun an hung inhuol a, ka buphal chu chibai an bûk tâwl a,” a tih a."
8,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.","A uhai chun a kuomah, “Nang tehin kan chungah ro i rêl vei ding maw? Nang tehin kan chungah thu i nei vei ding maw?” an tih a. Chuong- chun, a mang lei le a thuhril lei chun ama chu an theida nâwk zuol det a."
9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.","Chun, mang dang a nei nâwk a, a uhai chu a hril nâwk a, “Ngai ta u, mang ka nei nâwk a, nisa, thla le arasi sâwmpakhat khin chibai an mi lo bûk chu tie,” a tih a."
10,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?","Chun, a pa chu a hril a, a uhai khawm; chun, a pa chun a kâwk a, a kuomah, “Mang i nei hi ieng mang am a ni lie? Kei le i nu le i uhai hin hnuoi sikin chibai kan bûk hlak ding che am a nih?” a tih a."
11,And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.,"Chun, a uhai chun ama chu an îtthîk a, a pa ruok chun a thuhril chu lungrilin a vawn zing a."
12,And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.,"Chun, a uhai chu Sekema chun an pa ran ruol chu inthlain an feh a."
13,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.","Israel chun Josef kuomah, “I uhaiin Sekemah a ni maw ran ruol chu an inthla? hung ta, an kuomah tir ka ti che,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Mi tir ta la,” a tih a."
14,"And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.","A pa chun a kuomah, “I uhai an dam am, ran ruol khawm an dam am va en la, an chanchin mi hung hril nâwk rawh aw,” a tih a. Chuongchun, Hebron ruoma inthawk chun a tir suok a; ama chun Sekem chu a va tlung tah a."
15,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?","Chun, mi tuin amanih phûla ân vâk ân vâk lai chun a hmuh a; chuongchun, mi chun, “Iengam i zawng leh?” tiin ân dawn a."
16,"And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.","Ama chun, “Ka uhai ka zawng a nih: lunginsiettakin ran ruol an inthlâna chu mi hril ta khai,” a tih a."
17,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.","Mi chun, “Hitaka inthawkin an suok kha tie, ‘Dothanah fêng ei tiu,’ an ti chu ka hriet,” a tih a. Chun, Josef chun a uhai chu a hnawt a, Dothana chun a va hmuh a."
18,"And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.","Anni chun hlataka inthawkin an lo hmuh a, an kâwl hnai a tlung hmain ama thatna ding thu an lo rawt tah a."
19,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.","“En ta u, mang neipa a hung saw."
20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.","Thaw ro, that ei ta, khur pakhatah thlâk ei tiu khai; chun, ‘Sain a se tah,’ ei ti el ding annâwm: chuongchun, a manghai chu ieng- tin am a um hre el ei tih,” an inti tâwl a."
21,"And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.","Reuben ruok chun chu chu a lo hrietin an kuta inthawk chun a sansuok a, “A that êm chu that nâwng ei tiu,” a tih a."
22,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.","Reuben bawk chun a pa kuoma ṭhuoi nâwkna dinga an kuta inthawk chu a sansuok theina dingin, an kuoma chun, “Thisen chu insuo naw ro, thlalêra khura hin thlâk unla, kut chu a chunga hin thlâk naw ro,” a tih a."
23,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;","Chun, Josef chun a uhai kuom a va tlung chun, ama chu a zakawfuol rawng tamtaka ṭiel a ihâk chu an lo hlîppêk a;"
24,"and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.","an ṭhuoi a, khurah an thlâk tah a: khur chu a ruok tui um nawna a nih."
25,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.","Chun, bu fa dingin an hang ṭhung tâwl a; chun, an hang dâk a, Ismael inzinpâwl Gileada inthawk an sanghâwngseia riminhnik, thing hnai damdawi le murra phura Aiguptaa zu fe ding hunghai chu an hmuh a."
26,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?","Chun, Juda chun a unauhai kuomah, “Ei sang ei that a, a thisen suok ei ip chun iengam ṭhathnemna um a ta?"
27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.","Thaw ro, a chungah kut thlâk loin Ismael mihai kuoma sawn zawr el lem ei tiu; ama hi ei sang, ei tisa ngei a ni sih a,” a tih a. A unauhai chun a thu chu an zâwm tah a."
28,"And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.","Chun, Midian mihai sumdâwng an hung a; chuongchun, Josef chu khura inthawk chu an khai suok a, Ismael mihai kuoma chun Josef chu tangka sawmhniin an zawr tah a, anni chun Josef chu Aiguptaah an ṭhuoi tah a."
29,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.","Reuben chu khura chun a hung kîra Josef chu khurah a lo um ta nawh ti a hmu chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a,"
30,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?","chun, a sanghai kuom tieng a kîr nâwk a, “Bawipu kha a um ta nawh, kei hi khaw tieng am fe tâng ka ti leh aw?” a tih a."
31,"And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;","Chun, Josef zakawfuol chu an lâk a, kêlchal an thata a thia chun zakawfuol chu an inchieh a."
32,"and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son’s coat or not.","Chun, zakawfuol chu an inphur a, an pa kuoma chun an hung chawi a, a kuomah, “Hi hi kan hmu ringawt a, i naupa zakawfuol a ni am a ni naw en ta,” an tih a."
33,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.","Ama chun a lo hriet el a, “Ka naupa zakawfuol a ni hi, sahrângin a se tah a ni hi aw, Josef chu matheiloin keinawi nengin a um ni ngei a tih,” a tih a."
34,"And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.","Chun, Jakob chun a silfênhai a keithlêr a, saiip puon a dierkei a, ni sâwttak a naupa chu a sûn a."
35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.","A naupasalhai po po le a nau- nuhmeihai po po chu ama thlamuon dingin an tho a; nisienlakhawm, ama chun thlamuon a nuom nawh a, “Ni lo, lusûn pumin thlânah ka naupa kuomah ka fe ding a nih,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a pa chu ama ngaiin a ṭap hlak a."
36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.","Chun, Midian mihai chun Josef chu Aiguptaah Pharao hnuoia hotu pakhat, vêngtu pâwl hotu Potiphar kuoma chun an zâwr a."
