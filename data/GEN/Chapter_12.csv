1,"Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee:","Chun, LALPAIN Abram kuoma chun, “I khuoa inthawk le i laibunghai laia inthawk le i pa ina inthawk chu suok la, ram ka lân entir ding che tieng chun fe rawh:"
2,"and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing:","Chuongchun, chi ropuitakah siem ka ti cheh a, mal khawm sâwm ka ti cheh a, i hming sukropui bawk ka tih: nang malsâwmna nîng i tih."
3,"and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.","Chun, malsâwmtu che taphawt chu malsâwm ka ta, ṭawngsie inphurtu che chu ṭawngsie inphur ka tih: nangmaa chun hnam tin la thawveng an tih,” a tih a."
4,"So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.","Chuongchun, Abram chu LALPAIN a kuoma a hril angin a fe tah a; Lota chu ama leh a fe veh a. Abram chu Harana inthawka a suok lai chun kum sâwmsari le panga mi a nih."
5,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.","Chun, Abramin a nuhmei Sarai le, a unaupa naupasal Lota le an sum themsuok po po le, Harana an mi neihai chu a ṭhuoi a; Kanaan rama fe dingin an suok a. Kanaan ram chu an tlung chun,"
6,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.","Abram chu chu rama Sekem hmun chen, More thingsaisuo hmun chen chun a fe pei a. Chuong lai chun Kanaan mihai chu chu rama chun an um a."
7,"And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.","Chun, LALPA chu Abram kuomah ân lâr a, “Hi ram hi i thlahai kuomah la pêng ka tih,” a tih a; chuongchun, chutaka chun a kuoma inlâr LALPA ta ding chun mâichâm a siem a."
8,"And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.","Chutaka inthawk chun Bethel saktienga tlânga chun ân tâwl a, chutaka chun puon in a zar a, a thlangtieng chun Bethel chu a um a, a sak tieng chun Ai khuo a um a; chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem nâwk a, LALPA hming chu a lam a."
9,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.","Chun, Abram chu Negeb panin a lân tâwl ta rawp a."
10,And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.,"Chun, chu rama chun ṭâm a hung tlah a; chu rama chun ṭâm chu a nasa êm leiin Abram chu Aiguptaa um hri dingin a zu fe tah a."
11,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:","Aigupta a lût ding lai chun a nuhmei Sarai kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, nuhmei hmêl ṭhatak i nih ti ka hriet;"
12,"and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.","chuleiin, Aigupta mihaiin an hmu pha che chun, ‘Hi hi a nuhmei a ni hi,’ tîng an ta, kei chu mi that an ta, nang ruok chu hlâng an ti che."
13,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.","I zâra ṭhataka ka um theina ding le, nangma leia ka hring theina dingin, ‘A farnu ka nih,’ ti pei rawh aw,” a tih a."
14,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.","Chun, Abram chu Aigupta a lût chun Aigupta mihai chun nuhmei chu an hmuh a, a hmêl chu ṭha an ti êm êm a."
15,"And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.","Pharao milienhai khawmin an hmuh a, Pharao kuomah a ṭhatzie an hril a; chuongchun, nuhmei chu Pharao inah an ṭhuoi lût tah a."
16,"And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.","Chun, ama chun Sarai lei chun Abram chu ṭhatakin a thawh a; chuongchun, berâm dâm, bâwng dâm, sabengtung chal dâm, suokpa dâm, suoknu dâm, sabengtung pui dâm, sanghâwngsei dâm a nei pha tah a."
17,"And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chun Abram nuhmei Sarai lei chun Pharao le a sûnghai chu namênin a sawisa ta nawh a."
18,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?","Chuongchun, Pharao chun Abram chu a ko a, “Ka chunga i thilthaw hi iengtizie am a ni ta leh? I nuhmei a nih ti iengdinga i mi hril naw am a na?"
19,"why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.","Iengdinga ‘ka farnu a nih’ i ti? Chu lei chun an nâwm ka nuhmeia ka lo nei ta hiel hi: en rawh, taka hi i nuhmei, ṭhuoi la, fe hmang dai rawh,” a ta."
20,"And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.","Chun, Pharao chun a chung- châng thua chun mi kuomah thu a pêk a; chuongchun, ama an hang inthla tah a, a nuhmei leh, a nei po po le chun."
