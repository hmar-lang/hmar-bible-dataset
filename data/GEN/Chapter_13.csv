1,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.","Chun, Abram chu Aiguptaa inthawk chun a suok a, ama le a nuhmei le, a nei po po, ama ruolin Lota leh, Negeb-a chun an hang fe tah a."
2,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.","Chun, Abram chu ran dâm, tang- ka dâm, rângkachak dâmin a hausa êm êm a."
3,"And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,","Chun, Negeba inthawk chun Bethel tlung rakin a fe pei a, Bethel le Ai khuo inkârah, a tîrtaka a puon in umnaa khan;"
4,"unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.","a tîra a mâichâm siemna ngeia khan; chun, chutaka chun Abram chun LALPA hming a lam a."
5,"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.","Chun, Lota, Abram le fe ve khawm khan berâm ruol dâm, bâwng ruol dâm, puon in dâm a nei veh a."
6,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.","An um rêlna dingin ramin a dai ta nawh a, an thil nei chu a nasa hle sih a; chuongchun, an um hmunkhat thei ta dêr da el a."
7,And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.,"Chuongchun, Abram ran puhai le Lota ran puhai inkâra chun insêlna a hung suok tah a: chuong lai chun Kanaan le Periz mihai chu chu rama chun an um a."
8,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.","Chuongchun, Abramin Lota kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin, kei le nanga inkârah, ka ran puhai le i ran puhai inkâra khawm, insêlna um naw raw se; unau ei ni sih a."
9,"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou take the right hand, then I will go to the left.","Ram chu a pumin a um duoi a ni naw am a nih? Lunginsiettakin, ka kuoma inthawk hin insuktum el rawh: nang vawitieng i fe chun kei changtieng fêng ka ta, annawleh, nang changtieng i fe chun kei vawitieng fêng ka tih,” a tih a."
10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.","Chuongchun, Lota chu a dâk suok a, Zoar pan zâwng chun, Jordan phaizâwl po po chu LALPA huon ang, Aigupta ram ang khan ram tina tui um furna hmun a nih ti a hriet a, LALPAIN Sodom le Gomorra a suksiet hma kha a ni sih a."
11,So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.,"Chuongchun, Lota chun Jordan phaizâwl po po chu a thlang tah a; chun, Lota chu saktieng chun ân tâwl tah a: chuongchun, an inṭhe tah a."
12,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.","Abram chu Kanaana chun a um a, Lota chu phaizâwl khuohaia chun a um a, a puon in chu Sodom chenin a tâwl pei a."
13,Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.,"Chun, Sodom mihai chu Pathien mithmuin nasataka ṭha naw le suolin an um a."
14,"And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:","Chun, a kuoma inthawka Lota a tuma a um hnung chun, LALPAIN Abram kuomah, “Dâk la, i umnaa inthawk khan hmârtieng dâm, sim- tieng dâm, saktieng dâm, thlangtieng dâm en rawh:"
15,"for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.",i ram hmu po po hi i kuoma le i thlahai kuomah kumkhuoa dingin ka pêk ding che a nih.
16,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.","Chun, i thlahai chu hnuoia pilvut ang elin la siem ka tih: chuongchun, miin hnuoia pilvut hi an tiem sêng chun i thlahai khawm chu tiem sêng ni bawk an tih."
17,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.","Tho la, ram hi a dung a khangin fang suok rawh; i kuomah ka pêk ding che a nih,” a tih a."
18,"And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Abram chun a puon in chu a tâwl a, Hebrona um Mamre thingsaisuo kâwlhaia chun umhmun a va khuor a, chutaka chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a."
