1,"And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.","Jakob chun Laban naupa- haiin, “Jakobin ei pa ta po po a lâkpêk vawng a, ei pa taa mi a nih hieng hausakna a nei po po hi,” an ti thuhai a lo hriet a."
2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.","Chuongchun, Jakob chun Laban hmêl chu a en a, hi hma ang khan a chungah a ṭha ta nawh ti a hmuh a."
3,"And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.","Chun, LALPA chun Jakob kuomah, “I thlatuhai le i laibunghai ramah fe nâwk ta rawh, i kuomah um pei ka tih,” a tih a."
4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,","Chuongchun, Jakob chun mi a tir a, phûla a ran ruol umnaa chun Rakil le Leah chu ân kotir a;"
5,"and said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.","an kuomah, “In pa hmêl ka enin hi hma ang khan ka chungah a ṭha ta nawh ti ka hmuh a; nisienlakhawm, ka pa Pathien chu ka kuomah a um zing a nih."
6,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.,Nangni khawmin in pa rawng hi ka theitâwpin ka bâwl ti in hriet a.
7,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.","Nisienlakhawm, in pa chun a mi hlêm a, ka hlaw hi vawi sâwm lai a mi sukdanglampêk tah a; nisienla- khawm, Pathienin ka pawi a tawk a phal naw a nih."
8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.","A ze irawl nukhai chu i hlaw nîng a tih, a ti leh ran po po chun te, a ze irawl nukhai an nei hlak a; chun ‘A ze itanhai i hlaw nîng a tih,’ a ti leh ran po po chun te a ze itan ruok an nei hlak a."
9,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.","Chuong ang chun Pathienin in pa ranhai chu a lâkpêk a, kei a mi pêk tah a ni hi."
10,"And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.","Ranhai an inzâwl hun lai chun ka mangin ka hang dâk a, ran zâwltu a chalhai chu a ze intan dâm, a ze irawl dâm, a ze ṭielṭak dâm, an nih ti ka hmuh a."
11,"And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.","Chun, ka manga chun Pathien vântirkoin, ‘Jakob,’ a mi hung tih a. Kei chun, ‘Hitaka hi ka um,’ ka tih a."
12,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.","Ama chun, ‘Hung dâk la en rawh, ran zâwltu a chalhai po po saw, a ze intan dâm, a ze irawl dâm, a ze ṭielṭak dâm an ni saw: I chunga Laban thilthaw po po hi ka hmu a nih."
13,"I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.","Kei hi lungphuna sahriek i nâlna, a kuoma thu i tiemna, kha Bethel Pathien kha ka nih; tuhin tho la, hi rama inthawk hin suok la, i piengna rama chun fe nâwk ta rawh,’ a tih a,” a ta."
14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?","Rakil le Leah chun an dawn a, a kuomah, “Kan pa ina chun kan ta dingin chanvo le ro inkhâwm ding hrim a la um ta rawp am a nih?"
15,"Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.","Ama chun ram dang mi ang chauah a mi ngai tah ni lo am a nih? A mi zawr a, kan man khawm a fâk zo vawng ta sih a."
16,"For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.","Pathienin kan pa kuoma in- thawka sum a lâkpêk po po chu keini le kan nauhai ta a ni hi; chuongchun, Pathienin i kuoma a hril taphawt chu thaw raw khai,” an tih a."
17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;","Chuongchun, Jakob chu a tho a, a naupasalhai le a nuhmeihai chu sanghâwngseihai chungah ân chuongtir a;"
18,"and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.","chun, Kanaan rama a pa Isak kuoma fe dingin a ran po po le, a sum inkhâwl po po, a ran hmuhai, Paddan-aram rama ân khâwlhai chu a fepui ta vawng a."
19,Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.,"Laban chu a berâm hmul vaw dingin a fe dai a; chun, Rakil chun a pa milimhai chu ân rûkpêk a;"
20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.","chun, Jakob chu Aram mi Laban hriet naw kârin a fe hmang dai tah a, a tlân hmang ding chu a hril nawh a."
21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.","Chuongchun, a nei po po le chun a tlân hmang tah a; chun, a tho a, Vadungpui chu a kân a, Gilead tlâng tieng chu panin a fe pei tah a."
22,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.,"Jakob chu a tlân hmang ti, a ni thum niah, Laban an hril a."
23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.","Chuongchun, a unauhai a ṭhuoi a, ni sari lam a hnawt a, Gilead tlânga chun a hnawt phâk tah a."
24,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.","Chun, Aram mi Laban kuoma chun zânah a mangah Pathien a hung a, a kuomah, “Jakob kuomah a sie a ṭha, a iengkhawm hril lo dingin fîmkhur rawh,” a tih a."
25,And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.,"Laban chun Jakob chu a hnawt phâk a.Jakob chun a puon in chu tlânga chun a lo zar tah a; chun, Laban khawm chun a unauhai leh Gilead tlânga chun an zar ve tah a."
26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?","Chun, Laban chun Jakob kuomah, “I thilthaw hi iengtizie am a ni leh? ka hriet naw kâr i fe rûk dai a, kâwlhnâma salmanhai ang ela ka naunuhmeihai i ṭhuoi hmang hi?"
27,"Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;","Iengdinga inrûka i tlân hmang a, i mîn relrûk san a, hlimna le hla dâm, khuongte le ṭingṭang dâm le kan inthlana ding cheha i mi hril nawh a,"
28,and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.,ka naunuhmeihai le ka tuhai khawm ka fâwp i phal naw am an leh? Invêtthlâktakin a nih thil i thaw hi.
29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.","Suksethei che ka nih i sawn- naw: nisienlakhawm, i pa Pathien chun zâni zân khan, ‘Jakob kuomah a sie a ṭha iengkhawm hril lo dingin fimkhur rawh,’ tiin a mi biek a nih."
30,"And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?","Chun, i pa in ngai tain fe inhâwk êm êm la khawm, iengdinga ka pathienhai mîn rupêk am i nih a?” a tih a."
31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.","Jakob chun a dawn a, Laban kuomah, “Ka ṭi lei a nih, i nau- nuhmeihai hi mi lapêk rawi i tih, ti ka ṭiha a nih."
32,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.","Tukhawm i pathienhai i hmûna chu dam naw ni hai; ei unauhai mithmua hin i ta kan kuoma um chu en chieng la, la ta la,” a tih a. Rakilin a lo inrûk ti Jakob chun a hriet si nawh a."
33,"And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.","Chun, Laban chu Jakob puon ina dâm, Leah puon ina dâm, suoknuhai pahni puon ina dâm chun a lût pei a; nisienlakhawm, a hmu nawh a. Leah puon ina inthawk chu a suok a, Rakil puon ina chun a lût a."
34,"Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.","Rakil chun milim chu a lâk a, sanghâwngsei thuomhnaw lai chun a lo sieh a, a lo ṭhung deh a. Laban chun a puon in sûng po po chu a dap vêl vawng a, nisienkhawm, a hmu nawh a,"
35,"And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.","chun ama chun a pa kuomah, “I hmah a ka tho pei naw leiin, ka lalpa, lunginsen naw rawh; nuhmei umdân pângngai chu ka chunga a um lai tak a ni sih a,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a zawng a zawng a, milimhai chu a hmu zo ta nawh a."
36,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?","Chun, Jakob chu a lunginsen tah a, Laban chu a hal a. Jakob chun Laban kuomah, “Iengam ka bawsiet a, iengam a na ka suolna i mi hung hnawt rak el a?"
37,"Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.","Ka thuomhnaw po po i dap suok vawng khawmin, i insûng thuom- hnaw hrim iengam i hmu leh? Ka unauhai le i unauhai hmaa hin hung sie suok la, a tu lem am ei indik ngaituo raw hai se."
38,"These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.","Tuhin kum sâwmhni zet i kuomah ka um tah a, i berâmpuihai le i kêlpuihai chun an têhai an nei suol hrim hrim ngai nawh a, i berâm ruol laia a chalhai khawm ka fâk ngai bawk nawh."
39,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.","Ramsa se khawm i kuoma hin ka la hung intlun ngai nawh a, keiin ân hmang ai chu ka tuor lem hlak a, sûna inrûk ni leh, zâna inrûk ni leh ka ithung i phût hlak a."
40,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.","Vawi tamtak chu sûna nisa lum le zâna khawdeiin a mi sukrinum êm êm hlak a, îmu khawm ka hmu ngai nawh."
41,"These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.","Chuong kum sâwmhni sûng po chu i kuomah ka um a, i naunu- hmeihai pahni hlaw dingin kum sâwmpali le, i ranhai hlaw dingin kum ruk i rawng ka bâwl a; ka hlaw hlak chu vawi sâwm lai i sukdanglam sih a."
42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.","Ka pa Pathien, Abraham Pathien, Isak Iṭi chu ka kuomah um naw sienla lem chu, tu khawm hin ruok ngawta mîn fetir ngei ding i ni hi. Pathienin ka rinum tuor le ka rimsikzie chu a hmuh a, zâni zân chun a kâwk che a ni chu,” a tih a."
43,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?","Chun, Laban chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Naunuhmeihai hi keia nauhai an nih a, naupanghai hi keia naupanghai an nih a, ranhai hi keia ran an nih a, i hmu po po hi keia ta vawng an nih: vawisûn hin hieng ka naunuhmeihai chunga le an nauhai chunga hin iengam thaw thei ka ti leh?"
44,"And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.","Hung ta, kei le nang hin thu thlung ei tih, chu chu kei le nanga kâra hrietna ni raw se,” a tih a."
45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.","Chuongchun, Jakob chun lung a lâk a, lungphun dingin a phun a."
46,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.","Chun, Jakobin a unauhai kuom- ah, “Lung la khâwm ro,” a tih a; chun, lung an lâk a, an intieng khâwm a; chun, lung intieng khâwm kâwla chun bu an fâk a."
47,And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.,Laban chun chu lung intieng khâwm chu Jegar-sahadutha ân bûk a; Jakob ruok chun Galeed ân bûk a.
48,"And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:","Laban chun, “Hi lung intieng khâwm hi vawisûn hin kei le nanga kâra hrietpuitu a ni hi,” a tih a. Chuleiin, a hminga chun Galeed inbûk a ni tah a."
49,"and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.","Mizpah inbûk a ni bawk a, “Inṭheha ei um hnungin LALPA chun mi vêng tuo raw se."
50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.","Ka naunuhmeihai hi i sukrim- sih a, ka naunuhmeihai ni lo nuhmei dang i nei chun, tukhawm ei kuoma hin an um nawha chu, en ta, Pathien chu kei le nanga kâra hretu a nih,” a tih a."
51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.","Laban bawk chun Jakob kuomah, “Hi lung intieng khâwm hi en la, kei le nanga kâra hi lung ka phun khawm hi en ta."
52,"This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.","Pawi intâwkpêk dingin, keiin hi lung intieng khâwm hi khêlin i kuom tieng hung naw ningah a, ti le, nang khawmin hi lung intieng khâwm le hi lungphun hi khêlin ka kuom tieng hung naw ti nih, ti hi lung intieng khâwm hi hrietna ni sienla, hi lungphun khawm hi hrietna ni bawk raw se."
53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.","Abraham Pathien, Nahor Pathien, an pa Pathien chun ei kâra thu ngaituo raw se,” a ti nâwk a. Chun Jakob chun a pa Isak Iṭi chu sâlin ṭawng ân khâm tah a:"
54,"And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.","Chun, Jakobin tlânga chun inthawina ân hlân a, a unauhai chu bei fa dingin a ko a; chuongchun, bei an fâk a, tlânga chun an riek tah a."
55,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.","Chun, zingkâr Laban chu a tho a, a tuhai le a naunuhmeihai chu a fâwp a, mal a sâwm a; chun, Laban chu a feh a, ama umna tieng a kir nâwk tah a."
