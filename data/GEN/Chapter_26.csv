1,"And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.","Chun, chu rama chun Abraham dam laia ṭâm tla hmasa lem ti lo khawm kha, ṭâm a hung tla nâwk a. Chuongchun, Isak chu Philistin mihai lai Abimelek kuomah, Gerarah a zu feh a."
2,"And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:","Chun, LALPA chu a kuomah a hung inlâr a, “Aigupta rama chun zu fe naw rawh; ram ka hril ding chea chun um rawh."
3,"sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;","Hi rama hin um hri phawt la, chuongchun, i kuomah um ka ta, mal ka sâwm ding che a nih: hieng ram po po hi i kuoma le i thlahai kuomah pein i pa Abraham kuoma kân khâmna kha ka sukdet ding a nih."
4,"and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;","Vâna arasi zâtin i thlahai chu la sukpung ka ta, hieng ram po po hi i thlahai kuomah la pe bawk ka tih; chun, i thlaa chun khawvêla chi tin la thawveng an tih:"
5,"because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.","Abraham chun ka thu a awi a, ka hrilhai, ka thupêkhai, ka thuruothai, ka dânhai khawm a zâwm lei khan,” a tih a."
6,And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:,"Chuongchun, Isak chun Gerara chun umhmun a khuor tah a."
7,"and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, My wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.","Chu khuoa mihai chun a nuhmei chanchin an indawn a; ama chun, “Ka farnu a nih,” a ta: a hmêl a ṭhat leiin, “Hi khuoa mihai hin Rebeka lei hin mi that rawi an tih,” tiin, “Ka nuhmei a nih,” a ti ngam naw a nih."
8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.","Chutaka chun sâwttak a um hnungin, Philistin mihai lal Abimelek chun tukvera inthawkin a hei thlîr a; chun, ngai ta, Isak chun a nuhmei Rebeka chu ân saipui lai a hei hmuh a."
9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.","Chuongchun, Abimelekin Isak chu a ko a, “Ngai ta, i nuhmei a ni ngei hi, iengdinga ‘Ka farnu a nih,’ i ti am a na?” a tih a. Isak chun a kuomah, “Ama leiin thi rawi ka tih ka ti lei a nih,” a tih a."
10,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.","Abimelek chun, “Kan chunga i thilthaw hi iengtizie am a na? Mihai laia mi tukhawmin i nuhmei hi an lo zâlpui el thei i sawnnaw; chuong- chun, kan chunga hin thiemnawna i hung intlungtir a ni ding a nih,” a ta."
11,"And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.","Abimelek bawk chun, “Tu- khawm ama hi amanih, a nuhmei hi amanih tâwk tâwk chu sukhlum ngei ding a nih,” tiin, mi po po chu thu a pêk a."
12,"And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold: and Jehovah blessed him.","Chun, Isak chun chu rama chun bu a chîng a, chu kum chun a let za a hmuh a. LALPAIN ama chu mal a sâwm a,"
13,"And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great:","chuongchun, mi chu a hung hausa ta hleh a, nasataka mi neinung hung ni rau khawpin a hung lien ta duok duok a."
14,"and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Philistines envied him.","Berâm ruolhai, ran ruolhai a nei a, sûnghai tamtak a nei bawk a; chuongchun, Philistin mihai chun an thîk tah a."
15,"Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.","A pa Abraham dam laia a siehlawhaiin tuisunsuo an cho po po khawm chu Philistin mihai chun an nel a, pilin an vur bit ta vawng el a."
16,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.","Chun, Abimelekin Isak kuom- ah, “Keini nêkin i hrât lem sih a, kan kuoma inthawk hin fe hmang dai rawh,” a tih a."
17,"And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.","Chuongchun, Isak chu chutaka inthawk chun a suok a, Gerar ruomah a puon in a zar a, chutaka chun umhmun a khuor a."
18,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.","Chun, Isak chun a pa Abraham dam laia an tuisunsuo chohai chu a cho nâwk a; Abraham thi hnung khan Philistin mihai chun an lo nel tâwl ta sih a; chun, a pain a lo inbûk ta ang pei khan an hming chu ân bûk a."
19,"And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.","Isak siehlawhai chun ruomah an cho a, chutaka chun tuisunsuo hnâr nei an hmu ta hlau a."
20,"And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.","Gerar ranpuhai chun, “Tui hi kan ta a nih,” tiin Isak ranpuhai chu an insêlpui a: chuonga ama leh an insêl leiin tuisunsuo hminga chun Esek ân bûk tah a."
21,"And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.","Tuisunsuo dang an cho nâwk a, chu khawm chu lâkpêk tumin an insêlpui nâwk a; chuongchun, a hmingah Sitna ân bûk a."
22,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.","Chutaka inthawk chu ân tâwl a, tuisunsuo dang a cho nâwk a: chu ruok chu chu lâkpêk tumin an insêlpui ta nawh a: chuongchun, “Tuhin chu LALPAIN hmun lientak a mi siempêk tah a, hi rama hin chi tamtak thla tâng ei tih,” tiin, a hmingah Rehoboth ân bûk a."
23,And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.,Chutaka inthawk chun Beer- sebaah a hang feh a.
24,"And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.","Chu zân ngei chun LALPA chu a kuomah a hung inlâr a, “Kei hi i pa Abraham Pathien chu ka nih, ṭi naw rawh, i kuomah ka um annâwm, mal sâwm ka ti cheh a, ka siehlaw Abraham leiin i thlahai chu ka la sukpung ding a nih,” a tih a."
25,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.","Chuongchun, chutaka chun mâichâm a siem a, LALPA hming a lam a, chutaka chun a puon in a zar bawk a. Chun, Isak siehlawhai chun chutaka chun tuisunsuo an cho nâwk a."
26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.","Chun, Gerara inthawkin Abimelek chu ama thurâwntu Ahuzzath le a sipai hotu Phikol leh a kuomah an feh a."
27,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?","Isak chun an kuomah, “In mi theida a in kuoma inthawkin in mîn fe hmangtir sih a, iengdinga ka kuoma hung am in nih a?” a tih a."
28,"And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee: and we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,","Anni chun a kuomah, “LALPA chu i kuomah a um ti chiengtakin kan hriet a: chuongchun, ei kârah, keini le nangma kâr ngeia hin inkhâmna um sienla, i kuomah thu mîn thlungtir la kan ti a nih:"
29,"that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of Jehovah.","i pawi iengkhawm kan tâwk nawh a, thil ṭha bak naw chu i chunga hrim iengkhawm kan thaw nawh a, tlangtaka kan infetir el che ang khan, nang khawma kan sietna ding hrim i thaw nawna dingin: tuhin nang chu LALPA malsâwmna dawngtu i ni ta hi,” an tih a."
30,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.","Chuongchun, an ta dingin ruoi an ṭheh a, an fâkin an dâwn tah a."
31,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.","Zîngtieng chun inhmatakin an tho a, ṭawng an inkhâm tuoh a. Chun, Isakin anni chu ân fetir tah a, a kuoma inthawk chu lungmuongtakin an suok tah a."
32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.","Chu ni le le chun Isak sie- hlawhai chu an hung a, an tuisunsuo cho chanchin an hung hril a, a kuomah, “Tui kan hmu tah,” an tih a."
33,And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.,"Chu tuisunsuo chu Shiba ân bûk a: chuleiin, chu khaw hming chu tu chen hin Beer-seba a ni zing."
34,"And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:","Chun, Esau chu kum sâwmli mi a niin Hit mi Beeri naunu Judith le Hit mi Elon naunu Basemath nuhmeiah a nei a;"
35,and they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.,chuonghai chu Isak le Rebeka lungril sukrimsitu an nih.
