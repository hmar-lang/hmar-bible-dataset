1,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.","Chun, Josef chu a kâwla ngîr po pohai hmaa chun ân sûm zo ta nawh a, “Mi po po ka kuoma inthawk hin infe suoktir vawng ro,” tiin a khêk a."
2,"And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.","Chuongchun, Josef a unauhai kuoma ân hriettir sûng po a kâwlah tukhawm an ngîr nawh. Chun, a ṭap ta rak rak a, chuongchun, Aigupta mihai chun an hriet a. Pharao sûnghai khawmin an hriet bawk a."
3,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.","Chun, Josef chun a unauhai kuom- ah, “Josef kha ka nih, ka pa chu a la dam maw?” a tih a. Nisienlakhawm, a unauhai chun an dawn thei nawh a, a hmaa chun lungzîngtaka an um leiin."
4,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.","Josef bawkin a unauhai kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin mi hung hnai ta u,” a tih a. Chuongchun, an va hnai a. Ama chun, “In unaupa Josef, Aiguptaa lûtpui dinga in izawr kha ka nih."
5,"And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.","Tuhin hitaka fe dinga in mi zawr leiin lungngai naw ro, nangni le nangni intheida bawk naw ro: mihai hringna sanhim dingin Pathienin in hmaah a mi tir hmasa a ni hi."
6,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.","Hi kum hni sûng hi hi rama hin ṭâm a hung tla tah a: kum nga a la bâk a, chu sûng po chu hnuoi inlet um naw nih a, bu sîk khawm um naw bawk a tih."
7,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.","Chuongchun, hnuoia hin chithla- hai hlapêk ding cheu le, sanhimna ropuitaka in ta dinga mi tamtak sanhim ding cheuin, Pathienin in hmaah a mi lo tir hmasa a nih."
8,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.","Chuongchun, hitaka mîn kaitirtu hi nangni in ni nawh a, Pathien a ni lem, ama chun Pharao paa le a sûnghai po po hotuah le Aigupta ram po po rorêltuah a mi siem tah a."
9,"Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;","Inhmâwtakin ka pa kuomah hang fe unla, a kuomaah, ‘I naupa Josef chun hieng ang hin a tih, Pathienin Aigupta ram po po hotuah a mi siem tah a, ka kuomah hung thla rawh, sâwt hung riel naw rawh;"
10,"and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:","Gosen ramah um i ta, ka kâwl hnaiah i um ding a nih, nang le i nauhai le i tuhai leh, i berâm ruolhai le i bâwng ruolhai leh, i nei po pohai leh;"
11,"and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.","chutaka chun keiin châwm ka ti cheh a, ṭâm ding kum nga a la um sih a; chuong naw chun nang le i sûnghai le, i nei po po rimsi rawi in tih,’ ti ro."
12,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.","Tuhin nangni mit ngei le, ka sangpa Benjamin mit ngeiin, keia bau ngeiin a hril ti in hmu hi."
13,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.","Aigupta rama ka ropuina po po thu le, in thil hmu po po thu hi ka pa hril in ta, ka pa chu inhmâwtakin hitaka hin in hung ṭhuoi thlâk ding a nih,” a tih a."
14,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.","Chun, a ir le a sang Benjamin ir chu suktuoin a ṭap bawk a."
15,"And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.","Chun, a unauhai po po chu a fâwp a, a ṭap khum seng tah a; chu hnunga chun, a unauhai chun thukhawchâng an hrilpui tah a."
16,"And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.","Chun, “Josef unauhai an hung,” ti thuthang Pharao ina an lo hriet chun Pharao le a siehlawhai a suklâwm hleh a."
17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;","Pharao chun Josef kuomah, “I unauhai kuomah, ‘Hieng hin thaw ro, in sahai bu inphurtir unla, Kanaan ramah fe ro:"
18,"and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.","chun, in pa le in sûnghai chu hung ṭhuoi unla, ka kuoma hin hung ro; chuongchun, Aigupta ram ṭhatna lai tak pêng ka ti cheu a, chu rama thil ṭha takhai chu in fâk ding a nih,’ ti rawh."
19,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.","Chun, hieng ang hin hril bawk la: in nauhai ta ding le in nuhmeihai ta dingin Aigupta rama inthawk hin tawlailîrhai lain fe unla, in pa ṭhuoiin hung ro."
20,Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.,"In thuomhnaw khawm ngaituo nuom naw ro, Aigupta ram po poa thil ṭha taphawt hi in ta a ni sih a, tiin,” a tih a."
21,"And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.","Chuongchun, Israel nauhai chun chuong ang chun an thawh a: chun, Josef chun Pharao thupêk ang chun tawlailîrhai a pêk a, lampuia dingin fâk ding a pêk bawk a."
22,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.",An rênga kuomah silfên in- thlengna ding a pêk seng a; Benjamin kuoma lem chu tangka za thum le silfên inthlengna panga a pêk a.
23,"And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.","Chun, an pa kuoma chun sabengtung sâwm Aigupta rama thil ṭha phur le, sabengtungpui sâwm, bu le bei le, lampuia a pa ta dinga mamaw danghai phur ân phur a."
24,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.","Chun, a unauhai chu a tir suok a, an fe tah a: chun, ama chun an kuomah, “Lampuia inhal lo dingin fimkhur ro,” a tih a."
25,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.","Chuongchun, Aiguptaa inthawk chu an fe tung a, Kanaan rama, an pa Jakob kuom chu an hang tlung a."
26,"And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.","A kuomah, “Josef kha a la dam a, Aigupta ram po po rorêltu a nih,” tiin an hril a. Chun, a lung chu a chau sul a, an thu hril chu a awi si nawh a."
27,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:","Chun, a kuomah Josef thu hril po po chu an hril a; a chuongna ding tawlailîrhai Josefin a inphur chu a hmu chun an pa Jakob lungril chu a har ta huoi a:"
28,"and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.","chun, Israel chun, “A hun tah ie, ka naupa Josef chu damin a la um a ni tak tak hi: ka thi hmain ama zu hmûng ka tih,” a ti tah a."
