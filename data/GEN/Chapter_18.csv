1,"And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;","Abraham chu sûn nisa lum lai taka puon in kawtkhâr bula a ṭhung laiin, LALPA chu Mamre thingsaisuohai kâwla chun a kuomah a hung inlâr a."
2,"and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,","A hang dâk a, a thlîr a, a kâwl ela mi pathum lo ngir zing chu a hmuh a; a hmu phingleh puon in kawtkhâra inthawk anni chu tuok dingin a va tlân a, hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk a,"
3,"and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:","“Pu, i mi lunginsiet thei chun lunginsiettakin in siehlaw hi mi fe khel lul naw ro khai,"
4,"let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:","tui tlâwmte bêk hung la hai sienla, in kehai sâwp unla, thing hnuoia hin châwl hri ta u;"
5,"and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.","bei tlawmte bêk va lâng ka ta, in lungril sukhar ro khai, chu hnunga chun fe pei de ti niu, in siehlaw hi in mi hung sir ta si si hin chu,” a tih a. Anni chun, “I hril ang chun va thaw rawh,” an tih a."
6,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.","Chuongchun, Abraham chu puon in sûnga Sara kuoma chun a va lût vak a, “Beiphit indi tak tekhâwng thum siem la, hmet la, beiphêkhaiah siem rawh,” a ta."
7,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.","Chun, Abraham chu bâwngruol tieng a va tlân a, bâwngte ṭhatak hi a hung lâk a, siehlaw kuomah a pêk a; ama chun a lo siem vat vat a."
8,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.","Chun, nenetui kîng dâm, nenetui dâm, a bâwngte sa siem dâm chu a lâk a, an hmaah a va pêk tah a; chun, an fâk lai chun an kâwlah thing hnuoia chun a ngîr zing a."
9,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.","Chun, anni chun a kuomah, “I nuhmei Sara khawlai am a um a?” an tih a. Ama chun, “Saw puon ina sawn,” a tih a."
10,"And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.","Chun, ama chun, “Hi hun hi a hung tlung nâwk pha chun i kuomah hung nâwk ngei ka tih, chun, i nuhmei Sara chun naupasal nei a tih,” a ta. Chun, a hnunga puon in kawtkhâr bula inthawk chun Sarain a lo hriet a."
11,"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.","Abraham le Sara chu upatak, tartak el an ni tah a; nuhmei dân pângngai chu Sara chun a nei ta nawh a."
12,"And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?","Chuongchun, Sarain, “Tar ka ni ta hnung hin, lâwmna nei ka ti maw, ka lalpa hlak tar a ni ta sih a?” tiin a lungrilin ân nui a."
13,"And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?","Chun, LALPA chun Abraham kuomah, “Iengdinga Sarain,’ Tar ka ni hnung hin nau nei ka ti maw?’, tiha ân nui am a na?"
14,"Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.","LALPA ta dingin thil hrim hrim intak taluo a um am a nih? Hun ruotah, hun a tlung tiktik chun, i kuomah hung nâwk ka tih, chun Sara chun naupasal nei a tih,” a ta."
15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.","Chuongchun, Sara chun, “Kân nui nawh,” tiin ân phah a; a ṭi sih a. Chun, ama chun, “Awi lo lo chu, în nui de kha,” a tih a."
16,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.","Chun, mihai chu chutaka inthawk chu an tho a, Sodom tieng chu an en a; chun, Abraham chu anni inthla dingin anni lai chun a fe veh a."
17,"And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;","LALPA chun, “Ka thilthaw ding hi Abraham kuoma hin ka ip ding am a ni aw?"
18,"seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?","Abraham hi chi ropui le thilthawtheitak a la hung ni ngei ding a ni sih a, amaa chun khaw- vêla chi tin an la thawveng ding a ni sih a."
19,"For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.","LALPA lampui an hraw theina dingin, a hnunga a nauhai le a sûng- hai, thil feltaka thaw ding le rorêl anga thaw dinga thu a pêk theina dingin ama chu ka ruot ta sih a, a chungchâng thu a hril chu LALPAIN Abraham chunga ân tlungtir theina dingin,” a ta."
20,"And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;","Chuongchun, LALPA chun, “Sodom le Gomorra khêkri a nasa hlein, an suol a nasa êm êm a ni ngei a nih;"
21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.","tuhin zu fêng ka ta, an khêkri ka kuoma hung tlung ang hin an thaw ngei le an thaw ngei naw en ka ta; an thaw naw chun hre el ka tih,” a ta."
22,"And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.","Chun, mihai chu chutaka inthawk chun an inher a, Sodom tieng an pan tah a; Abraham ruok chu LALPA hmaa chun a la ngir zing a."
23,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?","Chun, Abraham chun a va hnai a, “Mi felhai chu mi suolhai lai chun i sukbohmang ve ding am a nih?"
24,Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?,"Khaw sûnga chun mi fel sâwmnga bêk an um el rawi mawh, a sûnga mi fel sâwmnga umhai lei chun khuo chu hla loin i sukbohmang el ding am a nih?"
25,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?","Nang êm chun, chuong ang êm chun, mi felhai chu mi suolhai anga an um vena dinga mi felhai chu mi suolhai laia sukhlum ve el chu i thaw awm êm si nawh a; nang êm chun i thaw âwm êm si nawh a: hnuoi chung po po Rorêltu chun feltakin a thaw naw ding am a nih?” a ta."
26,"And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.","Chun, LALPA chun, “Sodom sûnga chun mi fel sâwmnga khawm ka hmu chun anni lei chun khaw pumpui chu hla el ka tih,” a ta."
27,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:","Abraham chun, “Ngai ta, kei pilvut le meivâm el hin Lalpa chu ka biek pawp sa ta che chu:"
28,"peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.","mi fel chu pangain sâwmnga an tling naw a ni rawi mawh; Pangaa an tling naw leiin khaw pumpui chu i sukbohmang ding am a nih?” a tih a. Chun, ama chun, “Chutaka chun sâwmli le panga khawm ka hmu chun sukbohmang naw ning,” a tih a."
29,"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake.","Ama chun ama chu a biek nâwk pei a, “Chutaka chun sâwmli bak i hmu el rawi mawh,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Sâwmli lei khawm chun sukbohmang naw ning,” a ta."
30,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.","Chun, ama chun, “Aw, Lalpa chu lunginsen naw la, hril nâwk ka tih: chutaka chun sâwmthum chau i hmu el rawi mawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Chutaka chun sâwmthum khawm ka hmu chun sukbohmang naw el ka tih,” a ta."
31,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.","Ama chun, “Ngai ta, Lalpa chu ka biek pawp sa ta che; chutaka chun sâwmhni bak i hmu el rawi mawh,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Sâwmhni lei khawm chun sukbohmang naw ning,” a ta."
32,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.","Chun, ama chun, “Aw Lalpa, lunginsen naw la, vawikhat bak hang hril nâwk ka tih; chutaka chun sâwm bak i hmu el rawi mawh,” a ta. Chun, ama chun, “Sâwm lei khawm chun sukbohmang naw ning,” a tih a."
33,"And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.","Chun, LALPA chu Abraham le an inbiek zo phingleh a fe tah a, Abraham chu ama umna tieng a kîr nâwk tah a."
