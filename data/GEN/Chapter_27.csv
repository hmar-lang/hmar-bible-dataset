1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Here am I.","Isak chu a hung tar a, khaw hmu thei lo khawpa a mit a hung inthim chun, a naupa upa lem Esau chu a ko a, a kuomah, “Ka naupa,” a tih a: ama chun, “Hitaka hi ka um,” a tih a."
2,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.","Chun, amân a kuomah, “Ngai ta, ka tar ta bêk a, ka thi ni ding ka hriet si nawh a."
3,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison;","Chuleiin, tuhin, lunginsiettakin, i hriemhrei thal bâwm le i thal ngul kha chawi la, phûlah va suok la, sakhi mi va kâppêk rawh."
4,"and make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.","Chun, ka thi hmaa mal ka sâwm theina ding chein, ka du zâwng takin hme inhniktakah mi siempêk la, ka fâk dingin ka kuomah hung la rawh,” a tih a."
5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.","Chun, Isakin a naupa Esau a biek lai chu Rebekain a lo hriet a. Chuonga Esau chu sakhi kâpa hung hâwn dinga phûla a fe laiin,"
6,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,","Rebeka chun a naupa Jakob kuomah, “Ngai ta,i pa chun i u Esau kuomah hieng hin a ti ka hriet a,"
7,"Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death.","‘Sakhi mi hung kâppêk la, ka fâk a ka thi hmaa LALPA hmaa mal ka sâwmna ding chein, hme inhniktakin mi hung siempêk rawh,’ tiin."
8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.","Chuleiin, tuhin, ka naupa, thu ka pêk ang pei che chu zâwm rawh."
9,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth:","Ran ruol lai va fe la, chutaka inthawk chu kêlte ṭha deu deu pahni mi va lapêk rawh: chu chu a duzâwng takin i pa ta dingin hme inhniktakah lo siem ka tih;"
10,"and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.","chun, a thi hmaa mal a sâwm theina ding chein a fâk dingin i pa kuomah i va fepui ding a nih,” a tih a."
11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.","Jakob chun a nu Rebeka kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, ka u Esau chu mi inhmultak a nih a, kei ruok chu mi innâmtak ka ni sih a."
12,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.","Ka pa chun a mi lo them vêl el khawm a ni thei a, ama ngaiin hlêmtu ang hung ni ding ka nih a, malsâwm nêk hmanin ṭawngsie inphur ni lem el ka tih a,” a tih a."
13,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.","A nu chun a kuomah, “Ka naupa, i ṭawngse phur ding chu keia chungah um raw se: ka thu zâwm la mi va lapêk el rawh,” a tih a."
14,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.","Chuongchun, a va feh a, a va lâk a, a nu kuomah a hungpui a; chun, a nu chun a pa du zâwngin hme inhniktakin a lo siem tah a."
15,"And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son;","Chun, Rebeka chun a naupa upa lem, Esau silfên ṭhatak, ina a kuoma um chu a lâk a, a naupa naupang lem Jakob chu ân hâktir a;"
16,"and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:",kêlte vun chun a kut nâmna lai le a rîng nâmna lai chu a tuom a:
17,"and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.","chun, hme inhniktak le bei a siemhai chu a naupa Jakob kutah a pêk bawk a."
18,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?","Chun, ama chu a pa kuomah a feh a, “Pa,” a tih a; ama chun, “Hitaka hi ka um, ka naupa a tu lem am i nih a?” a tih a."
19,"And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.","Jakob chun a pa kuomah, “I naupa upa lem Esau ka nih, i mi tir ang khan ka thaw zo tah, lunginsiettakin tho la, mal mi sâwm dingin ṭhung la, ka sakhi sa hi fa raw le,” a tih a."
20,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.","Isak chun a naupa kuomah, “Ka naupa, iengtizie am a na i hung inhma ngei de?” a tih a. Ama chun, “LALPA i Pathienin a mîn hlâw- tlingtir lei a nih,” a tih a."
21,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.","Chun, Isak chun Jakob kuomah, “Ka naupa, lunginsiettakin hung hnai raw khai, lo them vêl ka ti che, ka naupa Esau i ni takzet am,” a tih a."
22,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.","Chun, Jakob chun a pa Isak chu a va hnai a; ama chun a lo them vêl a, “A rawl chu Jakob rawl a ni sih a, a kuthai chu Esau kut a ni sih a,” a tih a."
23,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.","Chuongchun, a kut chu Esau kut anga ân hmul leiin ama chu a hriet nawh a; mal a sâwm tah a."
24,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.","“Ka naupa Esau ngei i ni de maw?” a tih a. Ama chun, “Nih e,” a tih a."
25,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.","Chun, ama chun, “Mi hung chawi hnai pêk rawh, chuongchun, mal ka sâwm theina ding chein ka naupa sakhi sa chu lo fâng ka tih,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a hung chawi hnai pêk a, a fâk tah a; uoin khawm a lâkpêk a, a dâwn bawk a."
26,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.","Chun, a pa Isak chun a kuomah, “Ka naupa, hung hnai la mi fâwp rawh,” a tih a."
27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed:","Chuongchun, a va hnai a, a fâwp a: ama chun a silfên rim chu a hriet a, mal a sâwm tah a, “En ta, ka naupa rim hi LALPA malsâwm ram rim ang a nih"
28,"And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of grain and new wine:","Chuongchun, Pathienin vân daidaw, Le hnuoi ṭhatna hmun, Le bu le uoin tamtak pe raw se che."
29,"Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee: Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: Cursed be every one that curseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.","Mi chi tum tumin i rawng bâwl hai sienla, Hnam tum tumin chibai bûk raw hai se che. I unauhai lai lalah um la, I nu nauhaiin chibai bûk raw hai se che. Ṭawngsie inphurtu che taphawt chu ṭawngsephurin um sienla, Malsâwmtu che chu malsâwmin um raw se,” a tih a."
30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.","Chun, Isakin Jakob mal a sâwm zo a Jakob chu a pa kuoma inthawka a suok hman chauin, a u Esau chu a ramsuok a hung a."
31,"And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father; and he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.","Ama khawm chun hme in- hniktakin a siem a, a pa kuoma chun a hung chawi veh a, a pa kuoma chun, “Pa, tho la, mal i mi sâwmna dingin i naupa sakhi sa hi fa raw le,” a tih a."
32,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.","A pa Isak chun a kuomah, “Tu am i nih a?” a tih a. Ama chun, “I naupa, i naupa upa lem Esau ka nih,” a tih a."
33,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.","Chuongchun, Isak chu nasatak- in ân thin a, “Sakhi kâp a, ka kuoma a sa hung la a, i hung tlung hmaa ka ifâk zo ta a, mal ka isâwm ta kha tu am a nih a? Anih, ama chu malsâwmin um tho tho tâng a tih,” a tih a."
34,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.","Esau chun a pa thu hril a hrietin, nasatak le thlasetakin a ṭap tah a, a pa kuoma chun, “Aw pa, kei hi, kei khawm hi mal mi sâwm ve lul raw a tih a."
35,"And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.","Ama chun, ‘I sangin a mi hung hlêm a, i malsâwmna chu a lâkpêk ta che a nih,’ a tih a."
36,"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?","Esau chun a hminga Jakob an ti hi an ti dik hle ni lo am a nih? hi vawi hni a mi lân tah a nih a: ka nau lutir nina a mi lâkpêk a; chun, ngai ta, tuhin ka malsâwmna chu a mi lâkpêk nâwk ta hi,” a tih a. Chun, ama bawkin, “Malsâwmna i mi la hlapêk naw am a nih?” a tih a."
37,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with grain and new wine have I sustained him: and what then shall I do for thee, my son?","Isak chun a dawn a, Esau kuomah, “Ngai ta, ama chu i lalah ka siem a, a unauhai po po khawm a siehlaw dingin ka pêk vawng a; bu le uoinin ka châwm ta bawk a; ka naupa, nanga ta dingin iengam thawpêk ka ti cheh a?” a tih a."
38,"And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.","Esau chun a pa kuomah, “Pa, malsâwmna pakhat bak amani i nei? Aw pa, kei hi, kei khawm hi mal mi sâwm ve lul rawh,” a tih a."
39,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above;","Chun, Esau chu inringtakin a ṭap tah a. Chun, a pa Isak chun a dawn a, a kuomah, “Ngai ta, i umna hmun ding chu hnuoi ṭhatna hlata le, Chungtienga inthawka vân daidaw hlatah a nih a um ding chu."
40,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother; And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.","I kâwlhnâmin a nih i hring ding chu, i sang rawng khawm i bâwl ding a nih; În tleng suok pha ruok chun, A rîngkawl chu i rînga inthawk thinthla tâng i tih,” a tih a."
41,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.","Chun, a pain mal a sâwmna lei chun Esau chun Jakob chu a theida tah a. Esau chun a lungrilin, “Ka pa sûn ni ding chu a hnai tah a, chu pha chun ka sang Jakob chu that el ka tih,” a tih a."
42,"And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.","A naupa upa lem Esau thu hril chu Rebeka an hril a; chuongchun, mi a tir a, a naupa naupang lem Jakob chu a ko a, a kuomah, “Ngai ta, i u Esau chun i chungthuah nang sukhlum tum chein ân hnêm a nih."
43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;","Chuleichun, ka naupa, tuhin ka thu hi awi rawh: tho la, Harana ka ṭapa Laban inah tlânhmang rawh."
44,"and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;","I u lungsen hi a bo hmakhat chu ni iengzât lai amanih a kuomah va um phawt rawh,"
45,"until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?","i u lungsenna hi a bo a, a chunga i thilthaw hi a theinghil pha chun mi tir ka ta, chutaka inthawk chu hung inṭhuoitir ka ti che, iengdingin am ni khatah in pahni hni chun chân el ka ti cheu a?” a tih a."
46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?","Chun, Rebeka chun Isak kuomah, “Heth naunuhai lei hin nun hi ka nghawk a nih. Jakob hin hi ram nunghâk, hieng Heth naunuhai laia mi hi nuhmeiin a nei ve nâwk lem chun, ka ta dingin hring hi ieng am ṭhahnem a ta?” a tih a."
