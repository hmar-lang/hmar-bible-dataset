1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.","Chun, ama chun a in enkawltu kuoma chun, “Khahai ip kha an phur thei tâwkin buin suksip la, an tangka seng chu an ip bau bulah sie seng rawh."
2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.","Chun, ka no, tangkaruo no kha, an naupang tak ip bau bulah sie rawh, a bu man tangka le khan,” tiin thu a pêk a. Ama chun Josef hril ang chun a thaw tah a."
3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.",Khuo a hung var phingleh anni chu an sabengtunghai le chun an infetir tah a.
4,"And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?","Khuoa inthawka an fe suok chu an la tlung hlat hmain, Josef chun a in enkawltu kuoma chun, “Tho la, mihai kha va hnawt rawh; chun, i hnawt phâk phingleh an kuomah, ‘Iengtizieha thil ṭha thil ṭha nawha thung am in ni lie? Iengdinga ka tangkaruo no kha in inrûk am?"
5,"Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.","Kha kha ka pu uoin dâwnna le aisânna ngei a ni naw am a nih? hieng ang in thaw hi in thaw suol a nih,’ ti rawh,” a tih a."
6,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.","Chun, a hnawt phâk a, chuong thu chu an kuomah a hril a."
7,"And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Pu, iengtizie am a na hieng ang thu i hril hi? I siehlawhai hin chuong ang thil kan thaw naw dingzie chu."
8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?","Ngai ta, kan ip bau bula tangka kan hmuhai khawm kha Kanaan rama inthawkin i kuomah kan hung chawi nâwk kha: iengtin am i pu ina tangka amanih, rângkachak amanih inru thei kan ti leh?"
9,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.","I siehlawhai laia hin tukhawm i hmuna taphawt chu thi raw se, keini khawm ei pu suokah um el kan tih,” an tih a."
10,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.","Ama chun, “Aw le, in thu ang pei chu ni raw se chu: amiruokchu, tukhawm ka hmuna taphawt chu ka suokah um raw se, nangni ruok chu fe thei in tih,” a tih a."
11,"Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.","Chu phingle chun inhmawtakin mâni ip chu hnuoiah an lâk thlâk seng a, mâni ip chu an hawng seng bawk a."
12,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.","Chun, ama chun an upa takah a phut a, an naupang tak chenin a zawng a: chuongchun, no chu Benjamin ipa chun a hmu tah a."
13,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.","Chu phingle chun an silfênhai chu an keithlêr a, mâni sabengtung chu an inphurtir nâwk seng a, khuoa chun an kîr nâwk tah a."
14,And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.,"Chun, Juda le a unauhai chun Josef in chu an va tlung a, ama chu chutaka chun a lo la um zing a; chun, a hmaa chun an bawkkhup tâwl tah a."
15,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?","Chun, Josef chun an kuomah, “Ieng thil am an ta leh in thaw hi? Keia ang mi hin ai an sân thiem ngei ngei ti in hriet naw am a nih?” a tih a."
16,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.","Juda chun, “Pu, i kuomah ieng am hril tâng kan ti leh? Ieng am hril kan tih a? Iengtin am in hrilveng tâng kan ti leh? Pathienin i siehlawhai suolna chu a hmu suok tah a ni hi: ngai ta, pu, i suokhai kan ni a ni ta hi, keini le a kuta no an hmuna khawm hi,” a tih a."
17,"And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.","Chun, ama chun, “Chuong ang chun ka thaw naw dingzie chu: a kuta no an hmuna bak hi ka suokah um a tih: nangni ruok chu in pa kuomah lungmuongtakin fe ta ro,” a tih a."
18,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.","Chu phingleh Juda chun Josef chu a va hnai a, “Aw pu, lungin- siettakin i siehlaw hi i hrietah thu bau khat mîn hriltir rawh, i lunginsen chu i siehlaw chunga hin inchawktir naw la, nang chu Pharao ang el i ni sih a."
19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?","Pu, nangin, ‘Pa amanih, unau amanih in nei am?’ tiin i siehlawhai hi i mîn dawn a."
20,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.","Chun, pu, keinîn i kuoma hin, ‘Pa, tarsie le, a tar tieng nau, naupangtak kan nei, chu u chu a thih a, a pa chun ama chu a hmangai ngawt el,’ kan tih a."
21,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.","Chun, nangin i siehlawhai kuoma hin, ‘Ama chu ka mita ka hmu theina dingin ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi thla ro,’ i tih a."
22,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.","Chun, pu, keinîn i kuomah, ‘Bawipu chun a pa mâksan thei naw nih, a mâksan chun a pa chu a thi el ding a ni sih a,’ kan tih a."
23,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.","Chun, nangin i siehlawhai kuoma hin, ‘In mi tlumtak chu nangni le a hung thla ve naw chun ka hmêl hmu ta naw ti niu,’ i tih a."
24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.","I siehlaw kan pa kuom kan hang tlung chun, pu, i thu chu kan hril a."
25,"And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.","Chun, kan pa chun, ‘Fe nâwk phawt unla, bu tlâwmte bêk ei ta dingin zûn chaw nâwk ro,’ a tih a."
26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.","Chun, keinîn, ‘Zu fe thei ta naw ning ungah: kan mi tlumtak hi kan kuoma a hung ve ding chun zu fe nâwk el kan tih, kan mitlum tak hi kan kuoma a hung ve naw ding chun, ama hmêl chu kan hmu thei naw ding a nih,’ kan tih a."
27,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:","Chun, i siehlaw ka pa chun kan kuomah, ‘Ka nuhmei chun naupasal pahni a mi neipêk ti in hriet;"
28,"and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:","Chun, pakhat chu ka kuoma inthawkin a fe suok a; keinawi nengin a um ni ngei a tih ka tih a; chutaka inthawk chu ama chu ka hmu ta naw vang vang a."
29,"and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.","Ama khawm hi ka kuoma inthawk in ṭhuoi hmang a, tuoksuol a zu tuok chun, ka lu inṭuok hi lungngaitakin thlânah in mîn liemtir ding a nih,’ a tih a."
30,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;","Chuongchun, Bawipu hi kan laia ṭhang loa, i siehlaw ka pa kuom ka hang tlung chun, a hringna chu Bawipu hringna le hin ân zawm tlat leiin hieng ang hi nîng a tih:"
31,"it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.","Bawipu hi a ṭhang ve nawh ti a hriet phingleh thi el a tih: chuong- chun, i siehlawhai hin i siehlaw kan pa lu inṭuok rak chu lungngaitakin thlânah kan inliemtir ding a ni hi."
32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.","I siehlaw hin, ‘I kuoma ka hung ṭhuoi nâwk naw chun a maw chu kumkhuoin i chungah phur ka tih,’ tiin ka pa kuoma chun Bawipu chungthua hin a bul tumtuah kân siem ta sih a."
33,"Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.","Chuleiin, lunginsiettakin, i sie- hlaw hi Bawipu aiah, pu, i suokah mîn umtir la, Bawipu hi a uhai kuomah hang infetir rawh."
34,"For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.","Bawipu ṭhang loin ka pa kuomah iengtin am hang fe thei ka ti leh? ka pa chunga sietna tlung ding chu hmu ngam naw ning,” a tih a."
