1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.","Chun, Pathienin Noa le a naupasalhai chu mal a sâwm a, an kuomah, “Chi tamtak inthlain hung pung unla, hnuoi hi hluo sip ro."
2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.","Nangni ṭîna le pawisakna hnuoia sa tinrêng le chunglêng vate tinrêngin nei an ta; chuonghai le hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn po po le, tuisuorieta nga po pohai chu, in kuta pêk an ni vawng tah."
3,Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.,Thilhring chângthei tinrênghai chu in ta dingin fâk ding nîng an ta; thlai hring ka pêk ang cheu khan iengkim ka pêk vawng cheu.
4,"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.","Amiruokchu, sa a hringna (a thisen) pumin in fâk ding a ni nawh."
5,"And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man.","Chun, in thisen, in hringna phuba chu la ngei ngei ka tih; sa tinrêng chunga chun lâng ka tih, mihriem kuoma inthawk khawmin, mi tin an unauhaia inthawk chun, mihriem hringna phuba chu la seng ka tih."
6,"Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.",Tukhawm mihriem thisen in- suotu chu mihriem vêkin ama thisen chu an insuo ve ding a nih: Pathienin ama angpuiin mihriem a siem sih a.
7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.","Chun, nangni chu chi tamtak inthlain hung pung ro; hnuoia hin nau tamtak nei unla, a chunga hin hung pung ro,” a ta."
8,"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,","Chun, Pathienin Noa le a kuoma um a naupasalhai kuoma chun,"
9,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;","“Ngai ta u, keima ngeiin in kuoma le in hnunga in thlahai kuoma khawm ka thuthlung chu ka sukdet a nih;"
10,"and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.","in kuoma thilhring tinrêng um, in umpui vate dâm, ran dâm, ramsa tinrêng kuoma dâm khawm; lawnga inthawka hung suok po po, hnuoia sa tinrêng kuoma chen khawm."
11,And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.,"In kuomah ka thuthlung chu ka sukdet a; tisa po po tuilêta sukbo- hmangin um ta naw ni hai a, hnuoi sukse dingin tui lêt nâwk ta naw bawk a tih,” tiin a hril a."
12,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:","Chun, Pathien bawkin, “Hi hi kei le nangni le in kuoma thilsiem hringna nei tinrêng umhai kâra, suon tâwp loa um peihai ta dingin, ka thuthlung inchikna chu a nih."
13,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.","Sûmah ka sumrisâng kân zâmtir a, chu chu kei le hnuoi inkâra thuthlung inchikna ding nîng a tih."
14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,","Chun, hieng hi nîng a ta, hnuoi chunga sûm kân zâmtirin sumrisâng chu sûma chun inlang a ta,"
15,"and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.","kei le nangni le tisa po po laia thilsiem hringna nei tinrêng inkâra ka thuthlung hi hre zing ka tih. Chuongchun, tui chu tisa po po sukbohmang dingin hung lêt nâwk ta naw nih."
16,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.","Chun, sumrisâng chu sûmah inzâm hlak a ta; chuongchun, Pathien le hnuoi chunga tisa um po po laia thilsiem hringna nei tinrêng inkârah kumkhaw thuthlung um chu ka hriet zing theina dingin en hlak ka tih,” a ta."
17,"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.","Chun, Pathien bawkin, Noa kuoma chun, “Chu chu kei le hnuoi chunga tisa um po po inkâra thuthlung sukdetna inchikna a nih,” a ti bawk a."
18,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.","Chun, Noa naupasal lawnga inthawka suokhai chu Sem, Ham, le Japheth an nih: Ham chu Kanaan pa a nih."
19,These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.,Chuonghai pathum chu Noa naupasalhai an na: chuonghaia inthawka suokhai chun hnuoi po po hi an dâp zo tah a nih.
20,"And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:","Noa chu hnuoi inlettu hmasa- tak a nih a, Grêp huon a siem a,"
21,"and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.","uoin chu a dâwn a, ân rui a: chuongchun, a puon inah puon boin a zâl a."
22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.","Chun, Ham, Kanaan pa chun a pa saruokna chu a hmuh a, tuola a unauhai pahni chu a hril a."
23,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.","Chuongchun, Sem le Japheth chun puon an lâk a, liengkoa inzâwnin hnungtâwlin an feh a, an pa saruokna chu an inkhum tah a; an hmai chu khingtieng nghain a um a, an pa saruokna chu an hmu nawh a."
24,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.","Noa chu a uoin inrui chu a hung har a, a naupasal naupang takin a chunga a thawzie chu a hung hriet tah a."
25,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.","Chuongchun, “Kanaan chu ṭawngsephurin um raw se; A unauhai siehlawhai siehlaw nîng a tih,” a ta."
26,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.","“LALPA, Sem Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se. Kanaan chu Sem siehlawah um raw se"
27,"God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.","Pathienin Japheth chu suklien sienla, Sem puon inhaiah um raw se; Kanaan chu a siehlawah um raw se,” a ti bawk a."
28,And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.,"Chun, Noa chu tuilêt hnung chun kum za thum sâwmnga a dam a."
29,And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.,Noa dam sûng po po chu kum za kuo le sâwmnga a na; chun a thi tah a.
