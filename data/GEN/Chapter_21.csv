1,"And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had spoken.","LALPA chun a hril ta angin Sara chu a zu kan a, LALPA chun a tiem ta angin Sara chungah a thawpêk bawk a."
2,"And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.","Chuongchun, Sara chu ân rai a, Pathienin a kuoma a hril hun ruot taka chun Abraham chu a tar hnungin naupasal a neipêk tah a."
3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.","Abraham chun a naupasal nei, Sarain a neipêk chu a hmingah Isak a sak a."
4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.","Chun, Abrahamin Pathienin a kuoma thu a pêk ang khan, a naupa Isak chu ni riet a tlingin a ser a tanpêk a."

6,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh with me.","Chun, Sara chun, “Pathienin a mi suknui tah; mi tin a hre taphawt chun mîn nuipui an tih,” a tih a."
7,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.","Ama bawk chun, “Sara hin nautehai a la pawm ding a nih ti tuin am Abraham kuomah hril ngaina hrieng an ta? a tar hnung hin naupasal ka neipêk ta hi,” a tih a."
8,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.","Chun, naute chu a hung inṭhang a, nene nêk an inbântir tah a, Isak chu nene nêk an inbântir ni chun Abrahamin ruoi ropuitak a ṭheh a."
9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.","Chun, Aigupta mi, Hagar naupa, Abraham ta dinga a neipêk chun a nuisan lai Sara chun a hmuh a."
10,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son: for the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.","Chuleichun, Abraham kuoma chun, “Hi suoknu le a naupa hi hnawt suok rawh; hi suoknu naupa hi ka naupa Isak ro hluopuitu ding ni thei naw nih,” a tih a."
11,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.,Chu thu chu a naupa Ismael lei chun Abraham ta ding chun lung- ngaithlâk tak a nih.
12,"And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin Abraham kuoma chun, “Naupang le i suoknu chungchâng thu lei hin beidawng naw rawh: Sarain i kuoma thu a hril po po chu zâwm rawh, Isaka hin i thlahai an la ti ding a ni sih a."
13,"And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.","Chun, suoknu naupaa khawm hin i thla a ni leiin chi ti khawp zet la siem ka tih,” a tih a."
14,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and gave her the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.","Chuongchun, Abraham chu zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, bei le tuiûm a lâk a, Hagar kuomah a pêk a, a liengkoah ân chuonpêk a, naupang le chun ân fetir tah a; chuongchun, a feh a, Beer-seba thlalêra chun ân vâk ân vâk tah a."
15,"And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.","Chun, tuiûma tui chu a hung bo tah a, chuongchun, naupang chu chîmbuk pakhat hnuoiah a sie el tah a."
16,"And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.","Chun, “Naupang thi ding chu ka en ngam nawh,” a ti leiin a feh a, hla fe thal kâp phâk ding chena hin, a hma zâwna chun a va ṭhung ta chawt a. Chuonga a hma zâwna a ṭhung lai chun inringtakin a ṭap tah a."
17,"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.","Chun, Pathienin naupang râwl chu a hriet a, chun Pathien vântir- koin vâna inthawkin Hagar chu a zuk ko a, a kuomah, “Hagar, iengin am a sukbuoi che leh? ṭi naw; a umnaa naupang râwl kha Pathienin a hriet a nih."
18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.","Tho la, naupang kha keitho la, i kutin chel rawh, ama chu chi ropuitakah ka siem ding a nih,” a ta."
19,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.","Chun, Pathienin a mit a sukvarpêk a, tuisunsuo a hmu tah a: chuongchun, a va feh a, tuiûma chun tui chu a thun sip a, naupang chu ân dâwntir tah a."
20,"And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.","Chun, Pathien chu naupang kuoma chun a um hlak a, a hung inṭhang lien pei a; thlalêrah a um hlak a, thal kâp thiem mi a hung ni tah a."
21,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.,"Paran thlalêra chun a um a; chun, a nuin Aigupta rama inthawk nuhmei a neipêk tah a."
22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:","Chuong lai chun Abimelek le a sipai pâwl hotu Phikol chun Abraham kuomah, “I thilthaw taphawtah Pathien i kuomah a um pei hlak a:"
23,"now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.","chuleiin, ka lo lunginsiet ta che ang khan kei le hi i khuolchâmna ram hi lunginsiet ve thunga, kei le ka nau- pa le ka naupa naupa khawm hlêm lo dingin Pathien hming sâlin tuhin ka kuomah inkhâm rawh,” a tih a."
24,"And Abraham said, I will swear.","Abraham chun, “Inkhâm ta naw ning am,” a tih a."
25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.","Chun, Abimelek siehlawhaiin tuisunsuo an lâkpêk lei chun Abimelek chu Abraham chun a lo kâwk a."
26,"And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.","Abimelek chun, “Chu thil thawtu chu tu am a nih ka hriet dêr nawh a; nang hlakin i mi hril si nawh a, vawisûn chau naw chu ka la hriet dêr nawh,” a ta."
27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant.","Chuongchun, Abraham chun berâmhai le bâwngchalhai a ṭhuoi a, Abimelek kuomah a pêk a: chun, an pahni chun thu an thlung tah a."
28,And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.,Abraham chun a berâm ruol laia mi berâmte a la pasari a sie tum a.
29,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?","Abimelek chun Abraham kuomah, “Berâmte a la pasari a tuma i sie hi ieng tina am a na?” a ta."
30,"And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.","Ama chun, “Hi tuisunsuo hi keiin ka icho a nih ti i mi hrietpuina dingin hi berâmte a la pasari hi ka kuta inthawkin i lâk ding a nih,” a tih a."
31,Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.,"Chuleichun, chu hmun chu Beer-seba ân bûk a: chutaka chun an pahniha ṭawng an inkhâm rêl leiin."
32,"So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.","Chuongchun, Beer-sebaa chun thu an thlung tah a: chun, Abimelek chu a tho a, a sipai pâwl hotu Phikol leh Philistinhai rama chun an kîr nâwk tah a."
33,"And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.","Abraham chun Beer-sebaa chun tamarisk thing a phun a, chutaka chun LALPA Chatuon Pathien hming chu a lam a."
34,And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.,"Chuongchun, Abraham chu Philistin mihai rama chun sâwttak a um a."
