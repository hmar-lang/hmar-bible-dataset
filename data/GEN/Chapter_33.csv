1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.","Chun, Jakob chu a hang dâk a, a thlîr a, Esau, a mi za lihai le hung chu a hmuh a. Chuongchun, a nauhai chu Leah kuoma dâm, Rakil kuoma dâm, suoknuhai pahni kuoma dâm a sem diet diet a."
2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.","Suoknuhai le an nauhai chu a hmatâwng takah, Leah le a nauhai chu a dawtah, Rakil le Josef chu a nuhnung takah a sieh a."
3,"And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.","Ama chu an hmaa chun a feh a, a unaupa kuom tieng pana a fe chun a kuom a tlung hmain, vawisari hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk hman a."
4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.","Chun, Esau chu ama lâwm dingin a tlân a, a kuoh a, a ir a suktuoh a, a fâwp a; chun, an ṭap ve ve tah a."
5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.","Esau chu a hang dâk a, nuhmeihai le naupanghai chu a hmuh a, “I ṭhuoihai hi tuhai am an nih a?” a tih a. Ama chun, “Pathienin lunginsiettaka i siehlaw kuoma a pêk naupanghai an ni hi,” a tih a."
6,"Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.","Chuongchun, suoknuhai chu an nauhai le chun an hung hnai a, an kûn a,"
7,"And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.","Leah khawm a nauhai le chun an hung hnai a, an kûn a; chu hnunga chun Rakil le Josef chu an hung hnai a, an kûn veh a."
8,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.","Esau chun, “Ran ruol ka întuokpui zozaihai kha ieng i tina am a nih a?” a tih a. Jakob chun, “Ka lalpa, i lunginsietna ka hmu theina dingin ka ti a nih,” a tih a."
9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.","Chun, Esau chun, “Kei khawmin ka hau ie, ka sangpa, i nei po po chu i ta ni raw se,” a tih a."
10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.","Jakob chun, “Ni lo e, i mi lunginsiet thei chun lunginsiettakin ka lâwmman hi mi pawmpêk rawh: Pathien hmêl hmu angin i hmêl ka hmuh a, ka chungah i lâwm sih a."
11,"Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.","Pathienin a mi lunginsiet a, ka nei ṭeu leiin lunginsiettakin ka thil hung pêk che hi chu pawm rawh,” a tih a. Chuong ang chun a thlêm a, ama chun a pawm tah a."
12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.","Chun, Esau chun, “Hung rawh fêng ei tih, hma ṭhuoi pêk ka ti che,” a tih a."
13,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.","Jakob chun a kuomah, “Nau- panghai hi an la chîn a, berâm ruol le ran ruol ka kuoma umhai khawm hi te ṭhuoi an nih ti ka lalpain i hriet a; ni khat chau khawm khal hrât taluo inla, ran ruol po po hi thi vawng el an tih."
14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.","Ka lalpa, lunginsiettakin i siehlaw hmaa hin fe la, kei chu Seir tlângah ka lalpa kuom ka tlung hmakhat chu, ka hmaa ran fe hi an fe thei tâwk ang peiin le, naupanghai fe thei tâwk ang peiin, damtein hung sawm lem ka tih,” a tih a."
15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.","Chun, Esau chun, “Ka kuoma um mi ṭhenkhathai bêk hi mâksan- pêk ka ti che aw,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Iengding kherin am ie? ka lalpa, i lunginsietna mîn hmutir el rawh,” a tih a."
16,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.,"Chuongchun, Esau chu chu ni ma chun Seir tlâng tieng panin a kîr nâwk tah a."
17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.","Chun, Jakob chu Sukkoth-ah a feh a, ama ta dingin in a bâwl a, a ranhai ta dingin bûk a bâwl bawk a; chuleiin, chu hmun hming chu Sukkoth an ti tah a."
18,"And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.","Chun, Jakob chu Paddan-aram rama inthawka hungin, Kanaan rama um Sekem khuo chu himtakin a tlung a, khawhnâwma chun a puon in a zar tah a."
19,"And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.",A puon in zarna hmun chu Sekem pa Hamor nauhaia inthawkin tangka zain ân châwk a.
20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.","Chutaka chun mâichâm a siem a, a hmingah El-elohe-Israel ân bûk a."
