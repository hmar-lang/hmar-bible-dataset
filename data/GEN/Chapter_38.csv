1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.","Chuong lai chun hieng hi a nih a, Juda chu a unauhai laia inthawk chu a fe thlah a, Adullam mi pakhat a hming Hira chu a zu bêl tah a."
2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her.","Juda chun chutaka chun Kanaan mi pakhat a hming Sua naunu a hmuh a, ama chu a neia a pâwl tah a."
3,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.","Chuongchun, ân rai a, naupasal a nei a; chun, Juda chun a hmingah Er a sak a."
4,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.","Chun, ân rai nâwk a, naupasal a nei nâwk a; chun, a nuin a hmingah Onan a sak a."
5,"And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.","Chun, naupasal a nei nâwk a, a hmingah Selah a sak a: chu chu a nei lai chun Juda chu Chezib-ah a um a."
6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.","Juda chun a nau lutîr Er chu nuhmei a neipêk a, a hming chu Tamar a nih."
7,"And Er, Judah’s first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah slew him.","Nisienlakhawm, Juda nau lutîr Er chu LALPA mithmuah mi suol a nih a, LALPAIN ama chu a sukhlum tah a."
8,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.","Chun, Juda chun Onan kuomah, “I u nuhmei chu pâwl la, pasalhai unau thaw ding chu thawpêk la, i u ta ding chun chi thlapêk rawh,” a tih a."
9,"And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.","Nisienlakhawm, Onan chun chithla ding chu ama thla a ni naw ding a nih ti a hriet a; chuongchun, a u nuhmei a pâwl po leh a u ta dinga chi thlapêk lo dingin a chi chu hnuoiah a sukthlâk hlak a."
10,And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also.,"A thilthaw chu LALPA mithmua chun suoltak a nih; chuleiin, ama khawm chu a sukhlum tah a."
11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.","Juda chun a monu Tamar kuoma chun, “Ka naupa Selah hi a puitling hmakhat chu i pa in tieng pasal nei loin lo um phawt rawh,” a tih a. “Chuong naw chun ama khawm hi a uhai angin thi rawi a tih,” a ti a nih. Chuongchun, Tamar chu a pa in tieng chun a va um tah a."
12,"And in process of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.","Chun, a nakie chun Sua naunu, Juda nuhmei chu, a thih a; chun, a ngai a hung bo a, Timnaa berâm hmul vawtuhai kuom tieng chun ama le a ruolpa Adullam mi Hira chu an hang feh a."
13,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.","Chun, Tamar chu, “I tarpupa chu a berâm hmul vaw dingin Timnaah a hang fe ding a nih,” ti hril a nih a."
14,"And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife.","Ama chun a pasal sûnna silfênhai chu a hlîp a, inkhumna puonin ân khum a, ân tuom tlat a, Timna lampuia Enaim kul kawt- khâra chun a lo ṭhung a: Selah chu a puitling ta sih a, a pa chun a nuhmei dingin ân neitir naw zo a ni tah ti a hriet sih a."
15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face.","Chun, Judain ama chu a hmuin nawchizawr amanih a sâwn a, a hmai chu ân khum tlat sih a."
16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?","Chuongchun, lampui sîra nu- hmei tieng chu a va pan a, “Hung ta, lunginsiettakin zâl hmunkhat ei tih,” a tih a; a mo kha a nih ti a hriet si nawh a. Ama chun, “I mi zâlpui chun iengam mi pêng i ta?” a tih a."
17,"And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?","Ama chun, “Ran ruol laia kêlte inphur ka ti che,” a tih a. Chun, ama chun, “Chu chu i mi hung inphur hmaa lo hrên ding iemani bêk i mi pêk ding?” a tih a."
18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.","Ama chun, “Hrên ding ieng am pêng ka ti cheh a?” a tih a. Amanu chun, “I hming namna le i hrui, i hmawl chawi le khan,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a pêk a, a zâlpui tah a; chun, amaa inthawk chun nau a vawn tah a."
19,"And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.","Chun, a tho a, a inkhumna puon chu a hlîp a, a hmeithaina silfênhai chu ân bel nâwk tah a."
20,"And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.","Chun, Judain a thil hrên chu nuhmei kuta inthawk la dingin a ruolpa Adullam mi kutah kêlte chu ân phur a, nisienlakhawm, ama chun a va hmu zo nawh a."
21,"Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.","Chuongchun, nuhmei umna laia mihai kuoma chun, “Lampui sira Enaima nawchizawr um kha khaw lai am a um ta leh?” tiin ân dawn a. Anni chun, “Nawchizawr hrim hitaka hin an um nawh ie,” an tih a."
22,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no prostitute here.","Chuongchun, Juda kuoma chun a kîr nâwk a, “Ama chu ka hmu zo nawh, a hmuna mihai khawmin, ‘Nawchizawr hrim hitaka hin an um nawh,’ an lo ti bawk a,” a tih a."
23,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.","Juda chun, “Nei sawng el raw se, chuong naw chun muolpho rawi ei tih, en ta, hi kêlte hi kân phur a, ama i hmu zo si nawh a,” a tih a."
24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.","Thla thum vêl amani hnunga chun Juda chu, “I monu Tamar chun tlangvâl a dit a, chunawa khawm, ngai ta, sâwn a pai nghe nghe annaw,” tiha hril a nih a. Juda chun, “Ṭhuoi suok unla, raw hlumin um raw se,” a tih a."
25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.","Chun, an ṭhuoi suok chun Tamar chun, “Hi thil neitupaa inthawk hin a nih nau ka vawn chu,” tiin, a tarpupa kuoma chun mi a tir a; ama bawkin, “Lunginsiettakin hieng hming namna hai, hrui hai, hmawl hai hi tu ta am a nih en chieng ta khai,” a ti bawk a."
26,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.","Juda chun chuong thil chu ama ta a nih ti a hriet a, “Ama chu keia nêkin a fel lem a nih, ama chu ka naupa Selah chu kân neitir ta si nawh a,” a tih a. Chun, Juda chun ama chu a pâwl nâwk ta dêr nawh a."
27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.","Chun, nauhain a se laiin, ngai ta, a sula chun inphîr an lo um a."
28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.","A nau pakhat chun a kut a hung pur dawk a; chuongchun, nau dawm mi chun, “Hi hi a suok hmasa lem a ni hi,” tiin a chel a, a kuta chun pat sen ân buntir a."
29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? therefore his name was called Perez.","A kut chu a kei lût nâwk lai chun, ngai ta, a unau chu a hung suok tah a; chuongchun, nau dawmtu chun, “Iengdinga suokna ding insiem am i nih a?” a tih a, chuleiin, a hmingah Perez an sak a."
30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah.","Chu hnunga chun a unau pat sen bun kha a hung suok ve a, a hmingah Zera an sak a."
