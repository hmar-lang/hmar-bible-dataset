1,"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?","Chun, LALPA Pathienin ramsa a siem po poa chun rûl a var vervêk tak a. Ama chun nuhmei kuoma chun, “Pathienin ‘Huona thei ra hrim hrim hi in fâk ding a ni nawh,’ a ti am a nih?” a ta."
2,"And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:","Nuhmei chun rûl kuoma chun, “Ti lo e, huona thing rahai hi kan fâk thei a;"
3,"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.","huon lailung lai taka thing um, chu ra ruok chu Pathienin, ‘in fâk ding a ni nawh a, tâwk khawm in tâwk ding a ni nawh, chuong naw chun thîng in tih,’ a ti a nih,” a ta."
4,"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:","Rûl chun nuhmei kuoma chun, “Thi naw tawp in tih;"
5,"for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.","in fâk nia inthawk chun in mit hung var a ta, a suol le a ṭha hrein Pathien ang in hung ni ding a nih ti Pathienin a hriet zing a ni chu,” a ta."
6,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.","Chuongchun, nuhmei chun thing ra chu fâk mi a nih ti le, mitlatak a nih ti le, mi sukvar dingin thing ra inhnarumtak a nih ti a hriet chun a ra ṭhenkhat chu a lo a, a fâk tah a; chun a pasal kuoma chun a pêk a, ama khawm chun a fâk tah a."
7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.","Chuongchun, an pahni chun an mit a hung var a, saruok an nih ti an hung inhriet tah a; theichang hna an ṭhui mat a, puonbil an insiem fâwm tah a."
8,And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.,"Chun, LALPA Pathien chu zântieng nisa deia huona a hung lêng chu an hriet a: chuongchun, Mihriem le a nuhmei chun huona thing lai chun LALPA Pathien chu an lo inbîksan tah a."
9,"And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun mihriem chu a ko a, a kuomah, “Khâwlai am i um a?” a ta."
10,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.","Ama chun, “Huonah i ri ka hriet a, saruok ka ni leiin ka ṭi tah a, chuongchun, kân bihmang a nih,” a ta."
11,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?",Ama chun “Saruok i nih ti tuin am a hril cheh a? Thing ra fâk lo ding ka ti tlat che kha i fâk a ni maw?” a tih a.
12,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.","Mihriem chun, “A mi umpui dinga nuhmei i mi pêk ngei khan thing ra chu a mi pêk a, ka fâk tah a nih,” a ta."
13,"And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun nuhmei kuoma chun, “I thilthaw hi iengtizie am a na?” a ta. Nuhmei chun, “Rûlin a mi hlêm a ka fâk tah a nih,” a ta."
14,"And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:","Lalpa Pathien chun rûl kuoma chun, “Hieng ang hi i thaw leiin ran po po le ramsa tinrêng laia chun ṭawngsephurin um bîk i ta, bawk- khupin lâwn tâng i ta, i dam sûngin pilvut fa bawk i tih;"
15,"and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.","nang le nuhmei hi indotir ka ti cheu a, i thlahai le a thlahai khawm lân dotir bawk ka tih; ama chun i lu la sukthitling a ta, nangin a kekhawng la sukthitling i tih,” a ta."
16,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.","Nuhmei kuoma chun, “Nau vawnna le nau neinaa i rinumna chu nasatakin sukpung ka ta, natak tuorin nau nei hlak i ta; nisien- lakhawm, i nuom zâwng chu i pasal tieng nîng a ta, ama chun i chungah thu nei a tih,” a ta."
17,"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;","Chun, Adam kuoma chun, “I nuhmei thu i zâwm a, thing pakhat, ‘A ra i fâk ding a ni nawh,’ tiha thu ka pêk che kha a ra i fâk leiin hnuoi hi nanga leiin ṭawngsephurin a um tah a nih; i dam sûngin inrimtaka sinthawin a ra chu fa tâng i tih;"
18,thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;,"hling le buorhai khawm insuo- pêk a ti che; chun, hnuoia thlai chu fa tâng i ta;"
19,"in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.","hnuoia i kîr nâwk hmakhat chu, i hmaiah thlan luong rak khawpin bu fa tâng i tih; hnuoia inthawka lâk suok i ni sih a, pilvut i nih a, pil- vutah i kîr nâwk ding a nih,” a tih a."
20,And the man called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.,"Chun, mihriem chun a nuhmei chu mi hring po po nu a ni leiin a hmingah Evi ân bûk a."
21,"And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun, Adam ta ding le a nuhmei ta ding chun savun zakawfuolhai a siempêk a, ân hâktir tah a."
22,"And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever—","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun, “Ngai ta u, mihriem chu a suol le a ṭha hrein eini laia pakhat ang a hung ni tah a; tuhin chu a kuta banin, hringna thing ra chu loa fain, kumkhuoin hring rawi a tih,” a ta,"
23,"therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.","chuleiin, LALPA Pathienin ama a lâksuokna hnuoi chu inlet dingin Eden huona inthawk chun a tir suok tah a."
24,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.","Chuongchun, mihriem chu a hnawt dawk tah a; chun, hringna thing lampui chu vêng dingin Eden huon saktieng panga chun Cherubhai le mei kâwlhnâm inlet tuo zawk zawk chu a sie ta bawk a."
