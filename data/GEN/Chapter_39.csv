1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither.","Josef chu Aiguptaah an ṭhuoi thlâk a; chun, Pharao hnuoia hotu pakhat, vêngtu pâwl hotu Aigupta mi Potiphar chun, chutaka hung ṭhuoi thlatu Ismael mihai kuta inthawk chun ân châwk a."
2,"And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.","LALPA chu Josef kuomah a um a; chuongchun, ama chu mi hlawtling- tak a hung ni tah a, a pu Aigupta mi ina chun a um a."
3,"And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.","A pu chun LALPA chu a kuom- ah a um a, a thilthaw taphawt LALPAIN a kutah ân hlawtlingtir ti a hmuh a."
4,"And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.","Chuongchun, Josef chun a pu lunginsietna a hlawh a, ama rawng- bâwltuah a um a; chun, ama chu a sûnghai chunga hotuah a siem a, a nei po po a kutah a sie ta vawng a."
5,"And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.","A ina hotua a siem a, a nei po po chunga hotua a siem chena inthawk chu Josef leiin LALPA chun Aigupta mi sûng khat chu mal a sâwm tah a; in tieng le ram tienga a nei po po chu LALPAIN mal a sâwm a."
6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not aught that was with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.","Chuongchun, a nei po po chu Josef kutah a sie tlat a, a kuoma thil um hrim hrim chu a hrietpui dêr nawh a, ama bufâk bak naw chu. Josef chu mi pien ṭhatak a nih a, a hmêl khawm a ṭha hleh a."
7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.","Chuong hnunga chun hieng hi a nih a, a pu nuhmei chun Josef chu dit enin a en a, “Mi zâlpui rawh,” a tih a."
8,"But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:","Ama ruok chu a nuom nawh a, a pu nuhmei kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, ka pu chun hi ina hin ka kuomah ieng ieng am a um a hriet si nawh a, a nei po po chu ka kutah a sie vawng a;"
9,"he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?","hi ina hin keia nêka lien lem tukhawm an um nawh a: a nuhmei i ni leiin nang bak naw chu ka ta dingin iengkhawm inro a nei bawk nawh: chuleiin, iengtin am hi suol lientak hi thawin Pathien chungah thil suksuol thei ka ti leh?” a tih a."
10,"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.","Ni tinin Josef chu thlêm hlak sien khawm, ama zâlpui ding le ama kuoma um ding thu chu Josef chun a pawm nuom nawh a."
11,"And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.","Nisienlakhawm, ni khat chu, a sin chu thaw dinga in sûnga a va lût lai, chu ina mi tukhawm hrim an um naw lai chun,"
12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.","ama-nu chun, “Mi zâlpui rawh,” tiin a silfênah a lo man a; ama chun a silfên chu ama-nu kuta chun a tlânsan a, a suok ta dai a."
13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,","Chun, a silfên chu a kuta mâksanin a tlân suok tah ti a hriet phingleh,"
14,"that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:","ama-nu chun a ina umhai chu a ko a, an kuomah, “En ta u, a mi sukmuolpho dingin Hebrai mi pakhat ei kuomah a ṭhuoi lût ta hi; mi zâlpui tumin ka kuomah a hung lût a, chuongchun, râwl inringtakin ka khêk a;"
15,"and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.","chun, râwl insuoin inringtakin ka khêk ti a hriet phingleh, ka kâwlah a silfên hi a tlânsan a, a suok ta dai a ni kha,” a tih a."
16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.","Chun, Josef pu a hung hmakhat chu a silfên chu a kâwlah a lo sie zing a."
17,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:","A kuomah chu thu bawk chu a lo hril a, “Hebrai siehlaw ei kuoma i hung ṭhuoi kha, mi sukmuolpho tumin ka kuomah a hung lût a:"
18,"and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.","chun râwl insuoha ka khêk phingleh, ka kâwlah a silfên hi mâksanin a tlân suok tah a,” a tih a."
19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.","Josef pu chun a nuhmeiin a kuoma, “I siehlaw hin hieng ang hin a mi thaw,” tiha a hril chu a hriet chun, a lunginsen ta thut a."
20,"And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.","Chuongchun, Josef pu chun ama chu a ṭhuoi a, intângna in, lal mi intâng khuopa an umnaa chun a khum tah a, chuongchun, chutaka intângna ina chun a um tah a."
21,"But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA chu Josef kuomah a um pei a, a chungah za a ngai a, intângna in vêngtu khawm ân lunginsiettir a."
22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.","Chuongchun, intângna in vêng- tu chun intângna ina intânghai po po chu Josef kutah ân kawltir ta vawng a; chuongchun, chutaka an thaw taphawt chu Josef chu a thawtu a ni pei hlak a."
23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and that which he did, Jehovah made it to prosper.","LALPA chu Josef kuomah a um a, a thilthaw taphawt LALPA chun ân hlawtlingtir hlak leiin intângna in vêngtu chun a kuta thil um hrim hrim chu ama ngaisak ṭûl a ti ta nawh a."
