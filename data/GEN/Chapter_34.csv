1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.","Chun, Leah naunu Dina, Jakob a neipêk chu, chu ram nunghâkhai hmu dingin a va lêng suok a."
2,"And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.","Chun, Hiv mi Hamor, chu ram lal naupa Sekem chun ama chu a lo hmuh a; a man a, a zâlpui a, ân tlâwm tah a."
3,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.","Chun, a lungril chu Jakob naunu Dina chunga chun a um tlat a, chu nunghâk chu a hmangai a, bau ṭhatakin a biek a."
4,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.","Sekem chun a pa Hamor chu a biek a, “Chu nunghâk chu nuhmeiin mi neipêk rawh,” a tih a."
5,Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.,"Jakob chun a naunu Dina chu Sekem chun a sukkhawhlo ti a lo hriet a, nisienlakhawm, a naupa- salhai chu phûlah ran lai an um leiin an hung hmakhat chu a to zing a."
6,And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.,Sekem pa Hamor chu Jakob be dingin a kuomah a feh a.
7,"And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.","Jakob naupasalhai chun an hriet phingleh phûla inthawk chun an hung a; chun, Jakob naunu zâlpuiin Israelhai laiah thil suol invêtthlâk- tak, thil thaw dêr lo ding chu a thaw ta leiin an lungngai a, an lunginsen ta êm êm a."
8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.","Hamor ruok chun anni a biek a, “Ka naupa Sekem lungril chu in naunu chungah a um tlat a: lungin- siettakin nuhmeiin inneitir ta unla."
9,"And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.","Innei pawl ei tiu, in naunuhmei hai mîn neitir unla, kan nau- nuhmeihai khawm nei bawk ro."
10,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.","Kan ramah keini lai um in ta, in nuomna hmun hmunah um bawk unla, hienglai hin um unla, sum- dâwng unla, insukmuk ro,” a tih a."
11,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.","Sekem khawm chun a nunghâk pa le ṭahai kuomah, “Mi lunginsiet ro, ka kuoma in hril taphawt pêng ka ti cheu."
12,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.","Man le thilpêk chu iengzat khawm ngên unla, in ti ang peiin pêng ka ti cheu: iengkhawm ni sienla, nunghâk chu nuhmeiin mîn neitir phawt el ro,” a tih a."
13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,","Jakob nauhai chun an farnu Dina a sukkhawhlopêk lei chun Sekem le a pa Hamor chu zaihlêmin an dawn a,"
14,"and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.","an kuomah, “Hi thil, sertanlo mi kuoma kan farnu pêk hi thaw thei naw ning ungah; chu chu kan ta dingin hmingsietna ding a ni sih a:"
15,"Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;",hieng anga in tiem ruok chun in thu ang chu remti thei kan tih: nangni laia pasal taphawt chu keini angin sertanin um unla.
16,"then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.","Chuongchun, kan naunuhmei- hai inneitir kan ti cheu a, keini khawma in naunuhmeihai nei bawk kan ta; chun, in kuomah um kan ta, chi khat ei hung ni ding annâwm."
17,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.","Nisienlakhawm, sertan kawnga kan thu in zâwm naw ding chun, kan naunu chu ṭhuoi kan ta, fe el kan tih,” an tih a."

19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.","Chuongchun, tlangvâl chun Jakob naunu chu a dit hle sih a, chu thil chu sâwt nghâk loin a thaw nghâl tah a; ama chu a pa sûnghai laia inzâkai tak a nih."
20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,","Chun, Hamor le a naupa Sekem chun an khaw kul kawtkhâr chu an tlung a, an khuohai chu an biek a,"
21,"These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.","Sawtaka mihai saw mi rem- takin an um a, chuleiin, hi rama hin umin, hieng lai hin sumdâwng raw hai se, ngai ta u, an ta dingin ram khawm hi a lien huntâwk bawk a; an naunuhmeihai saw nuhmeiahai nei inla, ei naunuhmeihai khawm anni inneitir bawk ei tiu."
22,"Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.","“Nisienlakhawm, chi khat ei hung nina dinga ei kuoma um chu hieng anga ei tiem chau hin sawhai sawn an mi remtipui ding a nih a, sertan an ni angin eini laia pasal taphawt chu sertan hung ni ve inla."
23,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.","An ran dâm, an sum dâm, an sa po po dâm eini ta a ni vawng naw ding am a nih? An thu hi remtipui el ei tiu, chuongchun, ei kuomah an um el ding a nih.” an tih a."
24,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.","Chun, Hamor le a naupa Sekem thu chu a khaw kul kawtkhâra suok taphawt chun an zâwm a, a khaw kul kawtkhâra suok po po, pasal taphawt chun ser an intantir ta vawng a."
25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.","Chun, ni thum niha an nat laitak chun, Jakob naupasalhai laia mi pahni, Dina ṭahai Simon le Levi chun an kâwlhnâm chawi ve vein inrûkin khuo chu an thawh a, pasal po po chu an that zo vawng el tah a."
26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went forth.","Chuongchun, Hamor le a naupa Sekem chu kâwlhnâm ngeiin an that a, Sekem ina inthawkin Dina chu an ṭhuoi a, an suok tah a."
27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.","Jakob naupasalhai chun an mi thathai chu an va nangchîng a, an farnu an sukkhawhlo pêk leiin khuo chu an rawk tah a."
28,"They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;","An berâm ruolhai, an bâwng- ruolhai, an sabengtunghai, khuoa thil umhai le loa thil umhai an lâk- pêk a;"
29,"and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.","an sum po po an lâk a, an nauhai le an nuhmeihai po po an man a, in sûnga um taphawt chu an fe hmangpui tah a."
30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.","Chun, Jakobin Simeon le Levi kuoma chun, “Nangnîn hi rama um Kanaan mihai le Periz mihai laia hin, theida in mîn phurtirin in mi suklungzîng hle a nih; kei tlâwmte ka ni leiin mi thaw dingin hung inpun khâwm an ta, mi that el an tih; chuongchun, sukbohmangin um ka tih, kei le ka sûnghai le hin,” a tih a."
31,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?","Anni ruok chun, “Kan farnu hi nawchizawr thawin a thaw el ding a ni?” an tih a."
