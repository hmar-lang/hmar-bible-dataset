1,"And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with the help of Jehovah.","Chun, Adam chun a nuhmei Evi chu a pâwl a; chuongchun, ân rai a, Kaina a hung nei a, “LALPA ṭhangpuinain pasal ka nei tah,” a ta."
2,"And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.","Chun, a sang Abel a hung nei nâwk a. Abel chu berâm vêngtuah a um a, Kaina ruok chu hnuoi inlettuin."
3,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.","Chun, a nakie chun hieng ang hi a na, Kaina chun LALPA kuoma inhlân dingin loa inthawkin a hung lâk a."
4,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:",Abel khawm chun a berâm ruol laia a pieng hmasatakhai le a thau chu a hung lâk a. LALPA chun Abel le a thilinhlân chu a lâwm a;
5,"but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.","Kaina le a thilinhlân ruok chu a lâwm ve nawh a. Chuongchun, Kaina chu a lunginsen êm êm a, a hmêl a hung inthim khup el tah a."
6,"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?","LALPA chun Kaina kuoma chun, “Iengdinga i lung a sen am? Ieng- dinga i hmêl a hung inthim am?"
7,"If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee shall be its desire; but do thou rule over it.","Thil thaw ṭha ni la chu pawm i ni naw ding am a nih? I thaw ṭha naw ruok chun suol chu kawtkhâr bulah a bawk zing a nih; a dit zâwng chu nangma thuhne che a nih a, nisienlakhawm, nangin i thuhne lem ding a nih,” a tih a."
8,"And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.","Kaina chun a sang Abel kuomah, “Thaw ta, lo tieng va fêng ei tih,” a ta; loa an um lai chun Kaina chun a sang Abel chu a thawh a, a that ta el a."
9,"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Kaina kuoma chun, “I sang Abel kha khâwlai am a um tah a?” a ta. Ama chun, “Ka hriet nawh, ka sang vêngtu am ka nih?” a tih a."
10,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.","LALPA chun, “Iengam i thaw leh? I sang thisen râwl chun hnuoia inthawkin a mi ko a nih."
11,"And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;","Hnuoi, i kuta inthawka i sang thisen dawng dinga a bâu lo katua inthawkin ṭawngsephur i ni tah,"
12,"when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.","hnuoi în let pha khawm a ṭhatna chu pe phal ta naw ni che; hnuoia hin tlânhmang le invai hung ni tâng i tih,” a ta."
13,"And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.","Chun, Kaina chun LALPA kuomah, “I mi hremna hi a nasa bêk a, tuor zo naw ning."
14,"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.","Ngai ta, nangin vawisûn hin hnuoi chunga inthawkin i mi hnawt- hmang ta sih a; i mithmua inthawk thuphmangin ka um ding a ni tah a; hnuoia hin tlânhmang le invai ka lo ni ta ding a ni sih a, chuleiin, a mi hmu taphawtin mi that el an tih,” a ta."
15,"And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.","LALPA chun a kuomah, “Chuong a ni chun tukhawm Kaina thattu chu a let sariin a chungah phuba lâk nîng a tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, mîn an hmu a, an that nawna dingin LALPAIN Kaina chu ân chik tah a."
16,"And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.","Chuongchun, Kaina chu LALPA kuoma inthawk chu a suok tah a. Eden sak tienga Nod ramah a um tah a."
17,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.","Kaina chun a nuhmei a pâwl a, chuongchun, ân rai a, Enok a nei a; chun, khuo a siem a, a khaw hminga chun a naupa hming chawiin Enok a sak a."
18,And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.,Enok chun Irad a nei a; Irad chun Mehujael a nei a; Mehujael chun Methusael a nei a; Methusael chun Lamek a nei a.
19,"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.","Lamek chun nuhmei pahni a nei a, pakhat hming chu Ada a nih a, pakhat hming chu Zila a nih."
20,And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.,"Ada chun Jabal a nei a, ama chu puon ina um ran vaituhai thlatu a nih."
21,And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.,"A sang hming chu Jubal a na, ama chu ṭingṭang le theihle mûttuhai po po thlatu a nih."
22,"And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.","Zila khawm chun Tubal-kaina, dâr le thîr hriemhrei tinrêng suttu, a nei a; chun Tubal-kaina farnu chu Naama a nih."
23,"And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:","Lamek chun a nuhmeihai kuoma chun, “Ada le Zilla hai, ka rawl hre unla; Lamek nuhmeihai, ka thu hril hi ngai ro: Sukhliema ka um leiin mi ka that a, Vuok thitlinga ka um leiin tlangvâl ka that a nih:"
24,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.","Kaina phuba hman a let saria lâk a ni ding chun, Lamek phuba lem chu a let sâwmsari le pasariin lâk ni ngei a tih,” a ta."
25,"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For, said she, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.","Chun, Adam chun a nuhmei chu a pâwl nâwk a; chuongchun, ama chun naupasal a nei nâwk a, a hmingah Seth a sak a: “Pathienin Abel aiah chi thla dang a mi ruotpêk tah; Kaina chun ama a that ta sih a,” a tih a."
26,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.","Chun, ama, Seth ngei khawm chun naupasal a nei tah a; a hmingah Enos a sak a; chuong lai chun mihai chun LALPA hming chu an hung lam ṭan tah a."
