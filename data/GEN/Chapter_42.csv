1,"Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?","Jakobin Aigupta ramah bu a um ti a lo hriet a, a naupa- salhai kuomah, “Iengdinga in inen mei mei am a na?” a tih a."
2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.","Ama bawk chun, “Ngai ta u, Aigupta ramah bu a um ti ka lo hriet tah: thi loa ei hring suok theina dingin chutaka chun zu fe unla, chutaka inthawk chun zûn chaw ro khai,” a tih a."
3,And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.,"Chuongchun, Josef uhai sâwm chu Aiguptaah bu inchaw dingin an zu fe tah a."
4,"But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure harm befall him.","Josef sang Benjamin ruok chu a uhai lai Jakob chun ân fetir ve nawh a, “Tuok suol zu tuok hlau rawi a tih,” a ti a nih."
5,And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.,"Chuongchun, Israel naupasalhai chu mi fehai lai chun bu inchaw dingin an fe ve tah a, Kanaan rama khawm ṭâm a tla ve sih a."
6,"And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.","Chun, Josef chu Aigupta ram chunga chun hotu a nih a, ama chu chu rama mi po po kuoma a zawrtu a nih: chuongchun, Josef unauhai chu an hung a, hnuoi sikin ama chibai an bûk tâwl a."
7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.","Josef chun a uhai chu a lo hmuh a, anni chu a lo hriet tâwl hleh a; nisienlakhawm, mi dang anga hriet naw tehlêm thawin inrawm- takin anni a biek a, “Khawlaia inthawka hung am in nih a?” a tih a. Anni chun, “Bu inchaw dinga Kanaan rama inthawka hung kan nih,” an tih a."
8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.","Josef chun a uhai rawi chu a lo hriet a, anni ruok chun ama chu an hriet si nawh a."
9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.","Chun, Josef chun anni chung- châng thu manga a hmuhai kha a hung hriet suok tah a, an kuomah, “Enthlatuhai in ni hi, ram ruokzie en dinga hung in ni hi tie,” a tih a."
10,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.","Anni chun a kuomah, “Ni lo e, Pu, i siehlawhai hi bu inchaw dinga hung kan nih."
11,"We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.","Mi pakhat nau vawng kan nih a, mi indiktak kan nih, i siehlawhai hi enthlatuhai kan ni naw tawp el,” an tih a."
12,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Ka awi nawh, ram ruokzie en dinga hung in ni hi maw,” a tih a."
13,"And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.","Anni chun, “Keini i siehlawhai hi unau sâwmpahni, Kanaan rama um, mi pakhat nau kan nih: chun, ngai ta, kan mi tlum tak tuhin kan pa kuomah a um a, pakhat ruok chu a um ta naw a nih,” an tih a."
14,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:","Josef chun an kuomah, “ ‘Enthlatuhai in ni hi,’ ka ti kha in ni ngei hi."
15,"hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.",Hieng ang hin infiein um in tih: in mi tlumtak chu hitaka hin a hung naw chun Pharao hringna sâlin hitaka inthawk hin suok naw ti niu ti ka hril cheu.
16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.","Nangniah thutak a um le a um naw infiena dingin nangni laia mi pakhat tir unla, in sangpa chu hung ṭhuoi raw se; nangni ruok chu khuopin lo um phawt in tih: chuong naw chun Pharao hringna sâlin, ‘Enthlatuhai in nih,’ ka ti ngei ding cheu a nih,” a tih a."
17,And he put them all together into ward three days.,"Chun, an rêng chun ni thum ân tângtir tâwl a."
18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:","A ni thum ni chun Josef chun an kuomah, “Hieng ang hin thaw unla hring in tih, Pathien ka ṭi sih a:"
19,"if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:","mi indik in ni chun, in unau laia mi pakhat in intângna ina hin khuopin um sienla, a dang po chu fe unla, in sûnghai ṭâm ta ding chun bu phur ro:"
20,"and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.","chun, in mi tlumtak chu ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro; chuongchun, in thu chu fieng a ta, in thi naw ding a nih,” a tih a. Chuongchun, chuong ang chun an thaw tah a."
21,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.","Chun, anni chun, “Ei sangpa chunga ei thilthaw kha ei thiemnaw tak tak a ni hi, lunginsiet dinga a mi ngên ṭâwk ṭâwk laia, a lungril lungin- zîngzie hre zing siha ei ngaipêk nuom naw kha: chuleiin, hi lunginzîngna hin a mi hung nel ve a ni ta hi,” an in tih a."
22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.","Chun, Reuben chun, “Naupang chungah thil suksuol naw ro ka ti naw cheu am a nih? in ngai nawh a, chuleiin, ngai ta u, a thisen phuba chu an lâk a ni hi,” tiin anni chu a dawn a."
23,And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.,An kâra ṭawng inlettu a um leiin Josef chun an thu hril chu a hriet ti an hriet nawh a.
24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.","Chun, ama chu ân her hmang a, a ṭap tah a: chun, an kuomah a kîr nâwk a, anni a biek a, anni laia Simeon chu a tumin a ṭhuoi a; an mithmua chun a khuop tah a."
25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus was it done unto them.","Chun, Josef chun an bâwmhai chu bua suksip ding le an tangkahai an ipa sie nâwk seng ding le, lampuia dinga fâk ding pe dingin thu a pêk a: chuong ang chun an thaw pêk tah a."
26,"And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.","Chun, an bu chu an sabeng- tunghai chu an inphurtir a, chutaka inthawk chu an suok tah a."
27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.","Anni laia mi pakhatin riebûka chun a sabengtung bu pe dinga a ip a hang hawng chun, a tangka chu a hmu ta el a, a ip bau bula chun a lo um a."
28,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?","Chuongchun, a unauhai kuoma chun, “Ka tangka kha an lo sie nâwk a ni hi tie, en ta u, ka ipa hi a lo um zing el,” a tih a: chun an lung a kak rak a, “Pathienin hieng anga a mi thaw hi iengtizie am a ni aw?” tiin, inthin pumin an inen tâwl a."
29,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,","Kanaan rama an pa kuom chu an hung tlung a, an chunga thil hung tlung po po chu an hril a."
30,"The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.","“Chu an ram hotu chun inrawm- takin a mi biek a, ram enthlatuah a mi ruot a."
31,"And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:","Chun, keini chun a kuomah, ‘Mi indiktak kan nih, enthlatuhai kan ni naw tawp el,"
32,"we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.","unau sâwm le pahni kan nih; kan pa naupasalhai kan ni vawng a, pakhat chu a um ta nawh a, kan mi tlumtak chu tuhin Kanaan ramah kan pa kuomah a um a nih,’ kan tih a."
33,"And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way;","Chun, ram hotu chun kan kuomah, ‘Hieng ang hin mi indiktak in nih ti hre thei ka tih, in unau pakhat ka kuomah mâksan unla, in sûnghai ṭâm ta ding chun bu phur unla, fe ta ro: chun in mi tlumtak chu ka kuomah hung ṭhuoi ro:"
34,"and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.","chuongchun, enthlatuhai in ni nawh a, mi indiktak in ni lem ti hrieng ka tih; chun, in unaupa hi pe nâwk ka ti cheu a, hi rama hin sumdâwng tâng in tih,’ a mi ti a nih,” an tih a."
35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.","Chun, an iphai chu an bun ruok chun, ngai ta, an tangka fûn seng chu an ip senga chun a lo um a; chun, anni le an pa chun an tangka fûn chu an hmu chun an ṭi hleh a."
36,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.","Chun, an pa Jakob chun an kuomah, “Nangni hin ka nauhai in mîn sûntir a ni hi: Josef a um ta nawh a, Simeon a um ta nawh a, Benjamin chen khawm ṭhuoi hmang in tum nâwk pei a: chuong thil po po chun a mi baw buoi a ni ta hi,” a tih a."
37,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.","Chun, Reuben chun a pa kuomah, “I kuomah ka hung ṭhuoi nâwk naw leh ka naupasalhai hi that el de ti ni: ama chu ka kutah mîn kawltir la, i kuomah hung ṭhuoi nâwk el ka tih,” tiin a hril a."
38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.","Ama chun, “Ka naupa hi nangni leh fe thla ve naw tawp a tih, a u a thi tah a, ama bak hi a ni ta sih a: in fena lampuia dâm tuoksuol zu tuok sien- la, ka lu inṭuok hi lungngaitakin thlânah in inliemtir ding a nih,” a tih a."
