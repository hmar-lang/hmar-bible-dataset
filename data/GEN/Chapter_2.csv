2,And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.,"Chun, Pathienin ni sari nia chun a thilsiem chu a thaw zo a; ni sari nia chun a thilsiem po po chu a châwlsan tah a."
3,"And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.","Chuongchun, Pathienin ni sari ni chu mal a sâwm a, ân ser tah a: chu ni chun Pathienin a thilsiem po po, thu ngawta a siem le kuta a siemhai chu a châwlsan ta leiin."
4,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.","Hnuoi le vân siem an ni lai khan an thlahai chu hieng hi an nih, LALPA Pathienin hnuoi le vân a siem nia khan."
5,"And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;","Hnuoia hlo hrim hrim hi hnuoiah a la um nawh a, hnuoia thlai hrim hrim khawm hi a mâwng bawk nawh. LALPA Pathienin hnuoi chungah ruo a lân sûrtir si nawh a, hnuoi inlettu dingin mihriem hlak an la um bawk nawh;"
6,"but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.","amiruokchu, hnuoia inthawkin sûm a hung suok a, hnuoi chung po po chu a sukhnâwng a."
7,"And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.","Chun, LALPA Pathienin hnuoia pilvutin mihriem a siem a, a hnâra chun hringna thuok chu ân thuok lût a; chuongchun, mihriem chu mi hring a hung ni tah a."
8,"And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.","Chun, LALPA Pathienin sak- tieng Edena chun huon a siem a; a mihriem siem chu chutaka chun ân umtir a."
9,"And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.","Chun, hnuoia inthawkin, LALPA Pathienin thing mitlatak le fâkmi tinrêng ân mâwngtir a; hringna thing khawm huon lailung taka chun ân mâwngtir bawk a; a suol le a ṭha hrietna thing khawm."
10,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.","Chun, Edena inthawkin huon sukhnâwng dingin vadung a luong suok a; chutaka inthawk chun ân ṭhe dar a, pali a hung ni tah a."
11,"The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;",A pakhatna hming chu Pison a na; chu chu Havila ram po po luong huoltu chu a nih; chutaka chun rângkachak a um a;
12,and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.,chu rama rângkachak chu ṭhatak a nih; chutaka chun delium le onik lung khawm a um.
13,And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.,Vadung pahnina hming chu Gihon a nih; chu chu Kus  ram po po luong huoltu chu a nih.
14,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.,Vadung pathumna hming chu Hiddekel a nih; chu chu Assuria ram saktienga luong chu a nih. Vadung palina chu Euphrates a nih.
15,"And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.","LALPA Pathien chun mihriem chu a ṭhuoi a, Eden huona chun enkawltu le vêngtu dingin a sie tah a."
16,"And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun mihriem kuomah, “Huona thing tinrêng rahai hi i nuom nuomin i fâk thei a,"
17,"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.","a suol le a ṭha hrietna thing ra ruok hi chu i fâk ding a ni nawh; i fâk chun i fâk ni ngeiin i thi ngei ding a nih,” tiin thu a pêk a."
18,"And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun, “Mihriem ama khât baka a um hi a ṭha nawh ie; ama ṭhangpuitu ding, ân kawppui ding âwm mî siempêk ka tih ie,” a ta."
19,"And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.","Chun, LALPA Pathien chun pilin ramsa tinrêng le chunglêng vate tinrêng chu a siem a; an hmingah ieng ieng am ân bûk ding ti hrietna dingin mihriem kuoma chun a ṭhuoi tâwl a; chun, thilhring tinrênghai chu mihriem chun an hming a lo inbûk po chu an hming a ni sawng tah a."
20,"And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.","Chuongchun, mihriem chun ran po po dâm, chunglêng vate dâm, ramsa tinrêng dâm hming chu a sak seng a; nisienlakhawm, mihriem ta ding chun a ṭhangpuitu ding a kawppui âwm mi a um nawh a."
21,"And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:","Chuongchun, LALPA Pathien chun mihriem chu inhniktakin ân intir a; chuongchun, a in tah a; chun, a nâkru pakhat a lâk a, chu ai chu tisain ân hluosiptir a;"
22,"and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.","chun, LALPA Pathien chun mihriema inthawka a lâk nâkru chu nuhmeiah a siem a, mihriem kuoma chun a ṭhuoi a."
23,"And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.","Chun, mihriem chun, “Hi zet hi chu ka ru ang ru neia, ka tisa ang tisa nei ngei chu a nih; Pasala inthawka lâk suok a ni leiin, ‘Nuhmei’ ti ding nîng a tih,” a ta."
24,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.","Chuleiin, pasalin a nu le pa mâksan a ta, a nuhmei chel a tih, chuongchun, tisa pumkhat hung ni tâng an tih."
25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.","Chun, pasal le a nuhmei chu an pahni chun saruokin an um a, an inzak chuong nawh a."
