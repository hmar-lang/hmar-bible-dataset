1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.","Jakob chu a fe ta pei a; chun, Pathien vântirkohaiin an lo intuokpui a."
2,"And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.","Jakobin anni a hmu chun, “Hieng hi Pathien pâwlhai an nih,” a tih a; chuongchun, chu hmun hminga chun Mahanaim ân bûk a."
3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.","Chun, Jakob chun Seir rama Edom phûl tienga a u Esau kuoma chun a hmaah zuolkohai ân tlântir a."
4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:","“Ka lalpa Esau kuoma chun hieng ang hin in hril ding a nih, ‘I siehlaw Jakobin hieng ang hin a ti a nih: Laban kuoma chun mikhuol ka nih a, tu chen hin ka um ta zing a."
5,"and I have oxen, and asses, and flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.","Bâwngchal dâm, sabengtung le berâm dâm, suoknu le suokpa dâm ka nei bawk a, i lunginsietna ka hmu theina dingin, ka lalpa hril dingin mi ka hung tir a nih,’ a tih,” tiin, thu a pêk a."
6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.","Chun, zuolkohai chu Jakob kuomah an hung kîr nâwk a, “I u Esau kuom kan va tlung a, mi za li hung ṭhuoiin a tuok ding chein a hung nghe nghe annaw,” an tih a."
7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;","Chuongchun, Jakob chu a ṭi êm êm a, a lunginzîng tah a; chun, a kuoma mi umhai dâm, berâm ruol le bâwng ruol dâm, sanghâwngseihai dâm chu pâwl hniin a siem a:"
8,"and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.",Esau chu pâwl khatah a hunga a that khawmin pâwl khat la um chu tlân hmang thei an tih ti a ngaituoh a.
9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:","Chun, Jakob bawk chun, “Aw ka pu Abraham Pathien, ka pa Isak Pathien, aw LALPA, ‘I ram tieng le i laibunghai lai fe nâwk ta rawh, chuongchun, siem ṭhâng ka ti che’ mi titu,"
10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.",i siehlaw chunga lunginsietna po po în langtir le thutak po po în langtir laia a chîntak khawm hi hmu tlâk ka ni nawh; hi Jordan hi ka hmawl le bak ka kân a; tuhin chu pâwl hni zet ka lo ni ta hi.
11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.","Lunginsiettakin ka u kuta inthawk, Esau kuta inthawk ngei chu mi sanhim rawh, nunau puma a mi hung that ka ṭi sih a."
12,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.","Nangin, ‘Siem ṭha ngei ngei ka ti cheh a, i thlahai chu tuisuorieta phaiphin tiem sênglo khawp raua tam angin siem ka ti che,’ i ti sih a,” a tih a."
13,"And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:","Chun, chu zân chun chutaka chun a riek tah a; chun, a thil nei laia mi a u Esau ta dingin lâwmman dingin a sie tum a;"
14,"two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,","kêlpui za hni le kêlchal sâwm- hni, berâmpui za hni le berâmchal sâwmhni,"
15,"thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.","sanghâwngsei sâwrlai sâwm- thum an tehai leh, bâwngpui sâwmli le bâwngchal sâwm, sabengtungpui sâwmhni le sabengtungchal sâwm leh."
16,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.","Chun, chuonghai chu pâwl tin a tum sengin a siehlawhai kutah ân kawltir a: chun, a siehlawhai kuoma chun, “Ka hmaah fe kai unla, pâwl tin hi kâr inneitir pei ro,” a tih a."
17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?","A hmaṭhuoitu kuoma chun hieng hin thu a pêk a, “Ka u Esau chun ân tuokpui cheh a, ‘Tu mi am i nih a? Khâwlaia fe ding am? I hmaa umhai hi tu ta am?’ tiha ân dawn pha che chun,"
18,"then thou shalt say, They are thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.","‘I siehlaw Jakob ta an nih, pu Esau, i ta dingin lâwmmana ân phur che a ni hi: ama khawm kan hnungah a um’ ti rawh,” tiin."
19,"And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;","A dawttu le, a dawt nâwktu le ran ruol khaltuhai po po kuoma khawm, “Esau in hmu pha chun chuong ang tak chun in hril ding a nih."
20,"and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.","‘Chun, ngai ta, i siehlaw Jakob chu kan hnunga sawn a um,’ ti bawk unla,” tiin thu a pêk seng a. “Lâwmman ka hmaa fe hin a lung sukdam ka ta, chu hnunga chun a hmêl hmûng ka tih; chuongchun, mi lo lâwm el a tih,” a ti a nih."
21,So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.,"Chuongchun, lâwmman chu a hmaa chun a fe kai tah a, ama ruokchu chu zân chun a pâwl lai chun a riek tah a."
22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.","Chu zân chun a tho a, a nuhmeihai pahni le, a suoknuhai pahni le, a nau sâwm le pakhathai chu a ṭhuoi a, Jabbok vadung kaia chun a kai tah a."
23,"And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.","Chuongchun, anni chu a ṭhuoi a, vadung chu ân kaitir a, a nei po po khawm ân kaitir bawk a."
24,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.,"Chun, Jakob chu ama khât bakin a um tah a; chun, mi pakhatin ama chu khawfingchat chenin a buon a buon a."
25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.","A hne nawh ti ân hrietin a êlpui ru suktuona lai hi a khîk pêk a; chuongchun, a buon lai chun Jakob êlpui ru insuktuokna chu a hung inpelsawl tah a."
26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.","Chun, mi chun, “Mîn thla rawh, khawfing khawm a chat ding a ni ta hi,” a tih a. Jakob chun, “Mal i mi sâwm naw chun inthla naw ning che,” a tih a."
27,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.","Chun, mi chun a kuomah, “I hming iem a na?” a tih a. Ama chun, “Jakob,” a tih a."
28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.","Chun, mi chun, “I hming chu Jakob ti ta naw ni hai a, Israel ti lem tâng an ti che; Pathien le mihriem i thawh a, i hne ta sih a,” a tih a."
29,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.","Chun, Jakobin ama chu ân dawn a, “Lunginsiettakin i hming mi hril rawh,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Iengleia ka hming indawn am i nih a?” a tih a. Chun, chutaka chun mal a sâwm tah a."
30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, said he, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.","Chun, Jakobin chu hmun hminga chun Peniel ân bûk tah a, “Pathien chu a hmaihma ngeiah ka hmuha chu ka hringna hi hla a ni sih a,” tiin."
31,"And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.","Chun, Peniel a suoksan lai tak chun nisa a hung suok a, ama chu a hung khawh a, a êlpui lei chun ân bâi tah a."
32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.","Chuleiin, tu chen hin Israel thlahai chun êlpui ru suktuoha ke tha um hi an fâk ngai nawh: Jakob êlpui ru suktuo chu a ke tha laitaka a khîk leiin."
