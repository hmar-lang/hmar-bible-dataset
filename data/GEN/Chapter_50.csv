1,"And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.","Chun, Josef chun a pa hmai a sik a, a ṭah a, a fâwp a fâwp a."
2,And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.,"Chun, Josefin a siehlaw damdawi thiemhai chu a pa ruong chu hmawn thei loa siem dingin thu a pêk a: chuongchun, damdawi thiemhai chun Israel ruong chu hmawn thei loin an siem tah a."
3,And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days.,"A ruong siemna dingin ni sâwmli an awh a, hmawn thei loa siemna chun ni chuong zât chu a aw hlak hrim a nih; chun, ni sâwmsari sûng Aigupta mihai chun ama an ṭah a."
4,"And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,","Chun, ama an ṭa a bo hnung chun Josefin Pharao sûnghai chu a biek a, “In mi lunginsiet thei chun, lungin- siettakin Pharao hrieta chun,"
5,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.","‘Ka pain, ngai ta, ka thi ding a ni tah, Kanaan rama ka thlân ka chosaah, chutaka ngei chun mi hung phûm rawh,’ tiin a mîn khâmtir a. Chuleiin, tuhin lunginsiettakin, ka pa hi mi hang inphûmtir rawh; chun, hung nâwk el ka tih, a tih a, tiin hril ro,” a tih a."
6,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.","Chun, Pharao chun, “Ân khâmtir ang che chun i pa chu hang phûm raw chu,” a tih a."
7,"And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,","Chuongchun, Josef chu a pa phûm dingin a hang fe tah a. Pharao siehlaw po po, a sûnghai laia upahai leh, Aigupta ram upahai po po le,"
8,"and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.","Josef sûnghai po po leh, a unauhai leh, a pa sunghai chu ama leh an fe veh a. An nauhai rawi le, an berâm ruolhai le, an bâwng ruolhai bak chu Gosen rama chun an mâk- san a."
9,And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.,"Anni ruol chun tawlailîrhai le, sakawr chung chuong mihai an hang fe veh a; pâwl ruol lientak an nih."
10,"And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.","Chun, Jordan râla Atad hrizâwl chu an tlung a, chutaka chun nasatakin an ṭah a, ni sari a pa sûnna a siem a."
11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.","Chu rama mi Kanaan mihai chun Atad hrizâwla an mithi sûn chu an hmu chun, “Hi Aigupta mihai mithi sûnna nasatak a ni hi,” an tih a; chuleiin, chu hmun hminga chun Abel-mizraim an inbûk tah a, chu chu Jordan râla um a nih."
12,And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:,"Chun, a naupasalhai chun a thupêk ang peiin an thawpêk a,"
13,"for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.","a naupasalhai chun Kanaan ramah an zâwn lût a, Abrahamin inphûmna hmun ro dinga, Hit mi Ephrona inthawka a lo puma a închâwk, Mamre zâwna Makpela loa pûka khan an phûm tah a."
14,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.","Josef chu a pa phûm zo chun ama le a unauhai le, a pa phûm dinga ama ruola hang fehai po po le chun Aiguptaah an kîr nâwk tah a."
15,"And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.","Josef unauhai chun an pa thi chu an ngaituoin, “Josef hin mi theidâng a ta, a chunga thil ei suksuol po po phuba kha ei chunga hin la hung la kim nek el a ti aw,” an tih a."
16,"And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,","Chuongchun, Josef kuoma hril dingin thu an inchah a, “I pa chun a thi hma khan,"
17,"So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.","‘Hieng ang hin Josef kuomah, Lunginsiettakin i unauhai bawsietna le an suolna chu ngaidam rawh, i chungah thil chu an suksuol deha chu, tiin hril ro,’ tiin thu a mi pêk a: tuhin, lunginsiettakin i pa Pathien siehlawhai bawsietnahai chu ngai- dam rawh,” an tih a. Chuonga a kuoma an hang hril chun Josef chu a ṭap tah a."
18,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.","A unauhai khawm chu an va feh a, a hmaa chun an bawkkhup tâwl a, “Ngai ta, i siehlawhai kan ni hi,” an tih a."
19,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?","Josef chun an kuomah, “Ṭi naw ro, Pathien aiaw am ka nih?"
20,"And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.","Nangni chun ka chungah thil suol thaw in lungril a; nisienla- khawm, Pathien chun, vawisûna an um ang ngei hin, mi tamtak dama sanhimna dingin thil ṭhaha in- changtir a lo lungril lem a ni sih a."
21,"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.","Chuleiin, ṭi naw ro, nangni le in nau-le-tehai chu châwm pei ka tih,” a tih a. Chuongchun, a thlamuon a, bau ṭhatakin a biek tâwl a."
22,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.","Chun, Josef chu ama le a pa sûnghai leh Aigupta rama chun a um a: Josef chu kum za le sâwm a dam a."
23,And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph’s knees.,"Josef chun Ephraim nau a tuhai khûp thum chen a hmuh a, Manasse naupa Makir nauhai khawm Josef mal chungah an pieng a."
24,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.","Chun, Josefin a unauhai kuom- ah, “Ka thi ding a ni tah a, ni- sienlakhawm, Pathienin hung kan ngei ngei a ti cheu a, hi rama inthawk hi hung ṭhuoi suok cheuvin, Abraham, Isak le Jakob hai kuoma inkhâma pêk a tiem ramah ṭhuoi a ti cheu,” a tih a."
25,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.","Chun, Josef chun Israel thlahai chu ân khâmtir a, “Pathienin hung kan ngei ngei a ti cheu a, ka ruhai hi hitaka inthawkin khitieng in zâwn ngei ding a nih,” a tih a."
26,"So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.","Chuongchun, Josef chu kum za le sâwm mi a niin a thih a; a ruong chu hmawntheiloin an siem a, Aiguptaah kuongin an sie tah a."
