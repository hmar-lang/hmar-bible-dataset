1,And the famine was sore in the land.,"Chun, chu rama chun ṭâm chu a tla nasa hleh a."
2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.","Aiguptaah bu an phur kha an fâk zo chun, an pa chun an kuomah, “Fe nâwk unla, bu tlâwmte bêk ei ta dingin zûn chaw nâwk ro khai,” a tih a."
3,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.","Nisienlakhawm, Juda chun a kuomah, “Ama chun, ‘In sangpa in kuoma a hung ṭhang ve naw chun, ka hmêl hmu naw ti niu,’ tiin a mi tiem tlat a nih."
4,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:",Kan sangpa hi keini leh i tir chun bu chu inchaw pêk kan ti che:
5,"but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.","i tir naw ruok chun zu fe naw ning ungah; ama chun kan kuomah, ‘In sangpa in kuoma a hung ṭhang ve naw chun ka hmêl hmu naw ti niu,’ a ti tlat sih a,” tiin a hril a."
6,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?","Israel chun, “Iengdinga sang dang in la nei thu dâm hril khera ka ta dinga thil ṭha nawtak thaw am in ni leh?” a tih a."
7,"And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your brother down?","Anni chun “In pa chu a la dam am? unau dang in la nei am?” tiin kan chanchin le ei laibunghai chanchin a mîn dawn tlat sih a; chuong a thu mîn dawn ang pei chun kan hril a nih: “In sangpa chu hung ṭhuoi thla ro, tîng a tih ti tuin am hre kher kher a ti leh?” an tih a."
8,"And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.","Juda chun a pa Israel kuomah, “Bawipu chu ka kuomah infetir rawh, chuongchun, tho kan ta, fe el kan tih, keini le nangni le ei nau le tehai hi thi loa ei um theina dingin."
9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:","A chungthua hin keiin a bul tum pei ka tih: keia inthawk ngeiin ama chu phût rawh. I kuomah ka hung ṭhuoi nâwk a, i hmaa hin kân ngîrtir nâwk naw chun, a maw chu kum- khuoin phur de ningah;"
10,"for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.","muong naw inla chu tuhin a vawihnina khawm kan hung tlung nâwk ta ding bah,” a tih a."
11,"And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;","Chun, an pa Israel chun an kuomah, “Chuong ang a ni si chun hieng ang hin thaw ro, in bâwmhaia khan hi rama thil ṭha ṭhenkhat thinghnai damdawi, khuoizu, rimin- hnik, murra, theihâwngngar le almond thei dâm tlâwmte sengin ama ta ding chun lâwmman dingin chawi thla ro."
12,and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:,"Tangka khawm a lêt hniin chawi unla, in ip bau bula tangka a pêkkîr hai cheu khawm kha chawi kîr nâwk ro; a thaw pal a ni rawi mawh."
13,"take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:","In sangpa khawm chu ṭhuoi unla, tho unla, ama kuoma chun fe nâwk ro,"
14,"and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.","in sangpa pakhat le Benjamin hi ân suo pêkna ding cheuin, Pathien Iengkimthawthei chun ama chu inlunginsiettir raw se cheu. Ka nau- hai chu chân a ni leh ka chân ding ni el a tih,” a tih a."
15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.","Chuongchun, anni chun lâwm- man chu an chawi a, tangka khawm chu a lethniin an chawi bawk a. Benjamin khawm an ṭhuoi a: chun, an tho a, Aiguptaa chun an zu feh a, Josef hmaa chun an ngîr nâwk tah a."
16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.","Josef chun Benjamin an kuoma um chu a hmu phingleh, a in enkawltu kuoma chun, “Sawhai saw in sûngah ṭhuoi lût la, sa that la, buotsai rawh, anni sawn sûnah ka kuomah bu an fâk ding a nih,” a tih a."
17,And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.,Mi chun Josef thupêk ang chun a thawh a; anni chu Josef ina chun a ṭhuoi lût a.
18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.","Chun, Josef ina ṭhuoi lûta an um leiin an ṭih a, “Fe hmasak ṭuma ei ipa tangka a mi pêk kîrhai lei khan a ni hi a mi ṭhuoi lût: ei chunga remchâng zawnga mi thawin, eini le ei sabengtunghai le hin suoka um dinga mi man a tum a ni hi,” an tih a."
19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,","Chun, Josef in enkawltu kuoma chun an va feh a, kawtkhâr bula chun an biek a,"
20,"and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:","“Aw pu, kan hung hmasak ṭum khan bu inchaw ding ngawta hung thla kan nih a;"
21,"and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.","chun, riebûk kan tlung chun kan iphai chu kan hang hawng a; kan tangka seng chu kan ip bau bulah a lo um ta seng a, kan tangka chu a bûk ngai chiein a lo um a; chuongchun, kan hung chawi nâwk a nih."
22,And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.,"Chun, bu inchâwkna dingin tangka dang kan hung chawi a, kan tangka chu kan ipah tuin am a sie ti kan hriet si nawh,” an tih a."
23,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.","Ama chun, “Lungmuongtakin um unla, ṭi naw ro, in Pathien, in pa Pathien chun in iphaia chun ro a pêk cheu a ni chu: in tangka kha ka hmu sih a,” a tih a. Chun, Simeon chu an kuomah a hung ṭhuoi suokpêk tah a."
24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.","A in enkawltu chun anni chu Josef in sûngah a ṭhuoi lût a, tui a pêk a, an ke an sâwp tah a; an sabeng- tunghai chu bu a pêk bawk a."
25,And they made ready the present against Joseph’s coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.,Anni chun an lâwmman hung chawi chu Josef sûnbu faha a hung inlawi phaa dingin an lo siem lâwk diem a; chutaka chun bu an fâk ding a nih ti an hriet leiin.
26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.","Josef chu a inah a hung phingleh, an lawmman hung chawi chu in sûngah a kuomah an chawi lût a, hnuoi sikin chibai an bûk tâwl a."
27,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?","Ama chun an chanchin ân dawn a, “In pa a chanchin in hril tarpa kha a dam lai am a nih, damin a la um de maw?” a tih a."
28,"And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.","Anni chun, “Kan pa i siehlaw chu a dam lai a nih, damin a la um,” an tih a. Chun, an lu an kûn a, chibai an bûk nâwk a."
29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.","Chun, ama chu a hang dâk a, a sang Benjamin, a nu naupa chu a hmuh a, “Kha kha in mi tlumtak, a chanchin in mi hril kha a ni?” a tih a. Ama bawkin, “Ka naupa, Pathienin lunginsiet raw se che,” a tih a."
30,"And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.","Chun, Josefin a sang a hmu chun lungriemin a thlâk a, chuong- chun, ṭapna hmun inhmawtakin a zawng ta vat a, pindan sûngah a lût a, chutaka chun a ṭap suok tah a."
31,"And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.","Chun, a hmai a phih a, a va suok nâwk a, ân sûm hrâm hrâm a, “Bufâk siem ro le,” a tih a."
32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.","Chuongchun, ama ta dingin atumin, annirawi ta dingin a tumin, Aigupta mihai a fâkpuihai ta dingin a tumin an siem tah a. (Aigupta mihai chun Hebrai mihai chu buthlêng an awtpui thei si nawh; chuong anga thaw chu Aigupta mihai ta ding chun a thieng naw a nih)."
33,"And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.","Chuongchun, a upa tak chu a nau lutîr nina angin, a naupang tak chu a nau mitlum nina angin Josef hmaa chun an ṭhung pei a: chuong- chun, mak an ti tâwl seng a."
34,"And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.","Chun, Josef chun a kuoma chanvohai chu an kuomah ân hlân sâwngtir pei a. Benjamin chanvo lem chu an chanvo po po nêkin a lêtngain a tam lem a. Chun, uoin dâm an dâwn a, ama rawi chun an hlim ta hle a."
