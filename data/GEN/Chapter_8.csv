1,"And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;","Chun, Pathienin Noa le lawnga a kuoma thilhring tinrêng le ran um po po chu a hriet zing a; chun Pathienin hnuoi chunga hin thli ân hrângtir a, chuongchun, tui chu a hung kang ṭan tah a,"
2,"the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;","tui inthûktak hnarhai le vân tukverhai khawm chu a hung inkhâr tah a, vâna inthawka ruo hung sûr chu sukchâtin a um ta bawk a;"
3,and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.,"chuongchun, tui chu hnuoi chunga inthawk chun a kang ta deu deu a, ni za le sâwmnga chu a bo hnung chun tui chu a tlâwm ta deu a."
4,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.","Chuongchun, lawng chu thla sarina, ni sâwm le ni sari nia chun Ararat tlânga chun a lo innghat tah a."
5,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.","Chun, tui chu thla sâwmna chenin a tlâwm deu deu pei a; thla sâwmna ni khat nia chun, tlâng sîphai chu a hung inlang tah a."
6,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:","Chun, ni sâwmli hnunga chun Noa chun lawng tukver a siem kha a hawng tah a:"
7,"and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.","chun, vaâk pakhat ân vuong suoktir a; chu chu a suok a, hnuoia inthawka tui chu a kang zo hmakhat chu a vuong vêl a vuong vêl a."
8,"And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;","Chun, hnuoi chunga tui a tlâwm ta le tlâwm ta naw hrietna dingin vaṭhu ân vuong suoktir nâwk a;"
9,"but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.","nisienlakhawm, vaṭhu chun fûkna ding hrim hrim a hmu nawh a, a kuomah lawngah a kîr nâwk tah a, tui chu hnuoi chung po poa chun a la um sih a; chuongchun, a kut a hang pur dawk a, a man a, lawng sûngah a kuomah a lâk lût nâwk tah a."
10,And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;,"Chun, ni sari dang a nghâk nâwk a, vaṭhu chu lawnga inthawk ân vuong suoktir nâwk a;"
11,"and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.","vaṭhu chu zântieng chun a kuomah a hung lût nâwk a; chun, ngai ta, oliv hna suktlawng hlim a hmûra chun a hung put a: chuongchun, Noa chun hnuoiah tui a tlâwm tah ti a hriet a."
12,"And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.","Chun, ni sari dang a nghâk nâwk a, vaṭhu chu ân vuong suoktir nâwk a; a kuomah a hung kîr nâwk ta nawh a."
13,"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried.","Chun, a kum za ruk le a kum khatnaah, a thla khatna ni khat nia chun tui chu hnuoia inthawk chun a kang zo tah a: chuongchun, Noa chun lawng inkhumna chu a hâwk a, a en a; chun, ngai ta, hnuoi chung chu a lo inhil ta huou el a."
14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.",A thla hnina ni sâwmhni le ni sari nia chun hnuoi chu a hung ṭâwl zo tah a.
15,"And God spake unto Noah, saying,","Chun, Pathienin Noa kuoma chun a hril a,"
16,"Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.","“Lawnga inthawkin suok ro, nang le i nuhmei, i naupasalhai le an nuhmeihai leh."
17,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.","Tisa po po laia mi thil hringna nei tinrêng i umpuihai, vate dâm, ran dâm, thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn tinrêng dâm le khan i kuomah ṭhuoi suok rawh, hnuoia hin te neiin chi tamtak thlaha an hung pung theina dingin,” tiin."
18,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:","Chuongchun, Noa chu a suok a, a naupasalhai le a nuhmei le a nauhai nuhmeihai khawm a kuomah an suok veh a;"
19,"every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.","sa tinrêng dâm, thilhring tinrêng dâm, vate tinrêng dâm, hnuoi chunga chângthei taphawthai chu anni chi umdân ang sengin lawnga inthawk chun an suok tah a."
20,"And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.","Chun, Noa chun LALPA ta dingin mâichâm a siem a; chun, sa thieng tinrêng laia mi le, vate thieng tinrêng laia mi a lâk a, mâichâma chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai ân hlân tah a."
21,"And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake, for that the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done.","Chun, LALPAIN riminhnik chu a hriet a; chun, LALPA chun a lungrilin, “Hnuoi chu mihriem lei chun ṭawngsie inphur nâwk ta naw ning, mihriem lungril ngaituonahai chu an chîntea inthawkin a suol sih a; tuta ka hrem ang hin thilsiem hringna nei tinrêng chu hrem nâwk ta naw bawk ka tih."
22,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.","Hnuoi um sûng po bu tu le bu lâk, khaw dei le khaw lum, nipui le phalbi le, sûn le zân dâm hi bo naw nih,” a ta."
