1,"And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;","Vântirko pahni chu zântieng chun Sodom khuo an tlung a, Lota chu Sodom khaw kul kawtkhâra chun a lo ṭhung a: Lotain anni a lo hmu chun lâwm dingin a ngîr a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin chibai a bûk tah a;"
2,"and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.","chun, “Puhai, lunginsiettakin in siehlaw ina hin lût phawt unla, riek unla, in kehai sâwp ro khai: chun, inhmatakin tho in ta, fe nâwk de ti niu,” a tih a. Anni chun, “Ni lo e, khawlaiah riek lem kan tih,” an tih a."
3,"And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a thlêm a thlêm a; chuongchun, ama chu an zui a, a ina chun an lût a: chun, ama chun hme a siempêk a, chawl ṭhanglo bei a zeu a, an fâk tah a."
4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;","Nisienlakhawm, an zâl hmain khuoa mi, Sodoma mi ngei, vêng tina mi po po, alien achînin in chu an inhuol khup el a;"
5,"and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.","chun, Lota chu an ko a, a kuomah, “Vawizâna i kuoma mi hung lûthai kha khawlai am an um a? Anni kan pâwl theina dingin kan kuomah hung ṭhuoi suok rawh,” an tih a."
6,"And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.","Lota chu kawtkhâr bulah an kuoma chun a va suok a, kawt chu a khâr nâwk a."
7,"And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.","Chun, “Ka unauhai, lunginsiet- takin chuong ang êm êm chun suol da ta unla;"
8,"Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.","ngai ta u, pasal la pâwl ngailo naunuhmei pahni ka nei a: mi lunginsiet unla, anni chu in kuomah hung ṭhuoi suok ka tih, ṭha in ti ang peiin an chungah thaw de ti niu: hihai chunga ruok hin chu iengkhawm thaw lul naw ro khai; achu lei taka chu ka in sûnga hin hung lût an ni sih a,” a tih a."
9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.","Anni chun, “Inkieng el rawh ie,” an tih a. Anni bawk chun, “Hi mipa hrep hi hitaka um ding hin a hung inpêm lût a, rorêltua um a tum vei a! Tuhin chu anni chunga thaw nêk hmanin i chungah kan thaw ṭha naw nâwk zuol ding a nih,” an tih a. Chun, mi (Lota) chu an hung baw huk a, kawtkhâr chu sukse dingin an hung hnai a."
10,"But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.","Nisienlakhawm, mihai chun an kut an pur dawka Lota chu an kuomah in sûnga chun an kei lût a, kawt chu an khâr ta tlat a."
11,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.","Chun, kawtkhâr bula mihai chu alien achînin, an mit an sukdelpêk a; chuongchun, kawtkhâr chu an hmu zo ta nawh a."
12,"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place:","Chun, mihai chun Lota kuom- ah, “Hienghai naw hi hitaka hin sûnghai dang i nei am? I mâkpahai, i naupasalhai, i naunuhmeihai le khaw sûnga i nei taphawt chu hi hmuna inthawk ṭhuoi suok rawh."
13,"for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before Jehovah; and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it.","LALPA hmaa chun an khêkri chu a lo nasa ta hle leiin hi khuo hi kan sukbohmang ding a nih; sukbohmang dingin LALPA chun a mi tir bawk sih a,” an tih a."
14,"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked.","Chuongchun, Lota chu a fe suok a, a naunuhmeihai neitu a mâkpahai kuoma chun a va hril a, “Tho unla, hi hmuna inthawk hin suok ro; LALPAIN khuo hi a sukbohmang ding a nih,” a tih a. Nisienlakhawm, a mâkpahai ngaia chun fiemthu hril ang chau a nih."
15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.","Vârṭien a hung ni chun vântirkohai chun, “Tho la, i nuhmei le i naunuhmei pahni umhai hi ṭhuoi rawh, chuong naw chun, hi khaw hremnaa hin bohmang ve rawi in tih,” tiin Lota chu an tur tah a."
16,"But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.","Ama hlak chu a la muong hle sih a; chuongchun, LALPAIN ama chu a lunginsiet leiin mihai chun a kuta le a nuhmei kuta le, a naunuhmeihai pahni kuta chun an chel a, chuong- chun, an ṭhuoi suok a, khawhnâwma chun an sie tah a."
17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.","Chun, khawhnâwma an ṭhuoi suok hnung chun, “I hringna dingin tlân suok rawh: i hnungtieng ngha naw la, phaizâwla hrim hrim hin châwl bawk naw rawh; tlânga sawn tlân rawh, chuong naw chun, bohmang rawi i tih,” a tih a."
18,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:","Nisienlakhawm, Lota chun a kuomah, “Chuongchu ni lo e, Pu,"
19,"behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:","ngai ta, i siehlaw hin i lungin- sietna a hmuh a, ka hringna hi humhimin i zângaina chu nasatakin i suklang a; nisienlakhawm, tlânga sawn chu tlân thei naw ningah: thil ṭha nawtak hin mi hung nangin thi hlau rawi ka tih."
20,"behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.","En ta, saw khuo saw tlânna dingin a hnai tak a, khaw chite a ni bawk siha, chutaka chun (khaw chite ni lo am a nih?) mîn tlântir lem rawh, chuongchun, dam ka tih,” a tih a."
21,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.","Ama chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, chu thil kawnga khawm chun ka zâwm che a nih, khuo i hril chu sukbohmang naw el ka tih."
22,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.","Inhmaw la, chutaka chun tlân rawh, chu chu i tlung hmakhat chu iengkhawm ka thaw thei âwm si nawh a,” a tih a. Chuleiin, chu khaw hminga chun Zoar an inbûk tah a."
23,The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.,Lotain Zoar a tlung chun hnuoi chunga chun nisa a hung suok tah a.
24,Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven;,"Chun, LALPA chun Sodom le Gomorra chunga chun vâna LALPA kuoma inthawk kât le mei ân sûrtir a;"
25,"and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.","chuongchun, chuong khuohai chu, phaizâwl po po, khuoa mi po pohai le, hnuoia thil mâwnghai le chun a sukbohmang ta vawng a."
26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.","A nuhmei ruok chu Lota hnunga inthawk chun a ngha kîr a, chikhâwn banah a lo inchang tah a."
27,And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah:,"Chun, Abraham chu zîngkâr inhmatakin LALPA hmaa a ngirna hmuna khan a hang feh a;"
28,"and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.","Sodom le Gomorra khaw tieng le, phaizâwl po po tieng chu a thlîr a, a en zing a: chun, ngai ta, chu rama meikhu chu rawtuina meikhu ang elin a khu tung lui lui el a."
29,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.","Chun, Pathienin phaizâwl khuohai chu a sukbohmang lai chun, Pathienin Abraham chu a hriet zing a, Lota umna khuohai a sukbohmang laiin Lota chu bohmangnaa inthawk a tir suok a."
30,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.","Chun, Lota chu Zoara inthawk chun a hang feh a, tlânga chun a um a, a naunuhmeihai pahni chu a kuomah an um veh a; Zoarah a um ngam si nawh a: chun, ama le a naunuhmeihai pahni chu pûkah an um tah a."
31,"And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:","Chun, a upa lem chun a naupang lem kuoma chun, “Ei pa hi a upa tah a, khawvêl po po dân anga eini mi pâwl dingin hnuoi chunga hin pasal pakhat khawm an um ta si nawh a:"
32,"come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.","thaw rawh, ei pa hi uoin indâwntir ei ti khai, chuongchun, ei pa suonmawng loa ei siem theina dingin a kuomah zâl ei tih,” a tih a."
33,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.","Chuongchun, chu zân chun an pa chu uoin an indâwntir tah a; chun, a upa lem chu a lût a, a pa kâwla chun a va zâl a; ama chun amanu hung zâl lai chu a hriet nawh a, a tho nâwk lai khawm chu a hriet bawk nawh a."
34,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.","Chun, a zînga chun a upa lem chun a naupang lem kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, zâni zân khan ka pa kâwlah ka zâl a; vawizân khawm hin uoin indâwntir nâwk ei ti khai; chun, nang lût la, ei pa suonmawng loa ei siem theina dingin a kâwlah va zâl ve rawh,” a ta."
35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.","Chuongchun, chu zân khawm chun an pa chu uoin an indâwntir nâwk a: chun, a naupang lem chu a tho a, a kuomah a va zâl tah a; ama chun amanu hung zâl lai chu a hriet nawh a, a tho nâwk lai khawm chu a hriet bawk nawh."
36,Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.,Chuong ang chun Lota naunuhmeihai pahni chun an paa inthawk chun nau an lo vawn tah a.
37,"And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.","A upa lem chun naupasal a nei a, a hmingah Moab a sak a: ama chu tulaia Moab mihai thlatu a nih."
38,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.","A naupang lem khawm chun naupasal a nei veh a, a hmingah Ben-ammi a sak a; ama chu tulaia Ammon thlahai thlatu a nih."
