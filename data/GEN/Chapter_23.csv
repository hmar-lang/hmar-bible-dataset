1,And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years: these were the years of the life of Sarah.,Sara dam sûng chu kum za le sâwmhni le pasari a nih: chu chu Sara dam sûng kum chu a nih.
2,"And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.",Sara chu Kanaan rama Kiriath-arbaa chun a thih a (chu chu Hebron khuo a nih): chun Abraham chu Sara chunga ṭap ding le sûn dingin a hung a.
3,"And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying,","Chun, a mithi ruong hmaa chu a tho a, Heth thlahai kuoma chun,"
4,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.","“Nangni lai mikhuol le inpêm el ka nih a; ka mithi ruong hi ka phûm hmang theina dingin nangni lai hin inphûmna hmun ding ram mi pe ro,” a tih a."
5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,","Heth thlahai chun Abraham chu an dawn a, a kuomah,"
6,"Hear us, my lord; thou art a prince of God among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.","“Pu, lo ngai ta, nang chu keini lai hin lal ropuitak i nih a, kan thlânhaia hin i nuomna takah i mithi chu phûm el rawh, i mithi i phûmna dingin keini lai tukhawmin kan thlânhai pêk che inro naw ning ungah,” an tih a."
7,"And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.","Chuongchun, Abraham chu a tho a, chu rama mi, Heth thlahai chu chibai a bûk a."
8,"And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,","Chun, “Ka mithi chu ka phûm hmang in remti chun, mi lo ngai unla, Zohar naupa Ephron kuomah mi hnipêk unla,"
9,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.","a lo mawnga um amân a inei, Makpelaa pûk kha mi pe dingin. Inphûmna hmuna nei sawng dingin a man âwm tâwk intêlin nangni hrietah mi pe raw se,” a tih a."
10,"Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,","Ephron chu Heth thlahai lai chun a ṭhung ve zing a: chuongchun, Hit mi Ephron chun Heth thlahai hrietah, a khaw kul kawtkhâra lût taphawt hriet ngeia chun Abraham chu a dawn a,"
11,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the children of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.","“Ni lo e, pu, mi lo ngai ta, lo chu ka pêk cheh a, a sûnga pûk um khawm chu ka pêk bawk che; ka chipuihai nauhai mithmua hin ka pêk che a nih, i mithi chu phûm el rawh,” tiin."
12,And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.,"Chun, Abraham chu chu rama mihai hmaa chun a kûn a, chibai a bûk a."
13,"And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.","Chun, chu rama mihai hrieta chun Ephron kuomah, “Rem i ti chun, lunginsiettakin mi lo ngai la, lo man chu pe el lem ka ti che: ka kuoma inthawkin la la, chuongchun, ka mithi chu phûm ka tih,” a tih a."
14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,","Ephron chun Abraham chu a dawn a, a kuomah,"
15,"My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.","“Pu, mi lo ngai ta, hnuoi tangka sekel za li man dâm chu nang le keia ta dingin hril khawp am nîng a ti? I mithi chu phûm el rawh,” a tih a."
16,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.","Abraham chun Ephron thu chu a zâwm tah a; Heth thlahai hrietah, tangka a ihril zât, chu hun laia sumdâwnghaiin an ibûk hlak anga, tangka sekel za li, Ephron ta dingin a bûk tah a."
17,"So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure","Chuongchun, Mamre zâwna Makpelaa Ephron lo chu, a lo, a sûnga pûk um, loa thing um po po le a lo ri vêla thing um po po le chun,"
18,"unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.",Heth thlahai mithmua le a khaw kul kawtkhâra lût taphawt- hai mithmua chun nei sawng ding- in Abraham kuomah pêkin a um tah a.
19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.","Chu hnunga chun Abraham chun a nuhmei Sara chu Kanaan rama Mamre (chu chu, Hebron) zâwna Makpelaa loa pûka chun a phûm tah a."
20,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth.","Chuongchun, lo le a sûnga um pûk chu inphûmna hmuna nei sawng dingin Abraham kuomah Heth thlahai chun an pêk suok tah a."
