2,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.","Chun, Pathien chun, “I naupa, i naupasal nei sun, i lunginsiettak, Isak ngei kha ṭhuoi la, Moria rama chun fe la, chutaka chun tlâng pakhat hril ka ti cheh a, pumrawhmang inhlânah inhlân rawh,” a tih a."
3,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.","Chun, Abraham chu zîngkâr inhmatakin a tho a, a sabengtung a siem a, a kuomah a siehlaw tlangvâl pahni a ṭhuoi a, a naupa Isak le chun; chun, pumrawhmanga inthawina ding chun thing a chêk a, a tho a, Pathienin a hrilna hmun tieng chun a fe tah a."

And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?","Chun, Isakin a pa Abraham chu a biek a, “Pa,” a tih a. Ama chun, “Hitaka hi ka um, ka naupa,” a tih a. Chun, ama chun, “En ta, mei le thing chu a um a; anleh pumrawhmanga inhlân ding berâmte chu khawlai am a um a?” a tih a."
8,"And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son: so they went both of them together.","Abraham chun, “Ka naupa, Pathienin ama ta dinga pumraw- hmang inthawina ding berâmte chu ngaituo fâwm el a tih,” a tih a: chuong- chun, an pahni chun an fe pei tah a."

12,"And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.","Ama chun, “Naupang chunga khan i kut thlâk naw la, ama kha iengkhawm law naw rawh; i naupasal nei sun khawm mi pêk în ro naw leiin Pathien i ṭi ti tuhin ka hriet tah,” a ta."
