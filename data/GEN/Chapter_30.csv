2,"And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?","Rakil chunga chun Jakob chu a lunginsen thut el a; chuongchun, “I rîla ra phalnawtu Pathien aiawtu bêk am ka nih?” a tih a."

Chun, Rakil chun Leah kuomah, “Lunginsiettakin i naupa zâwldiai a ṭhen mi pe ta?” a tih a."
15,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.","Ama ruok chun, “Ka pasal i mi lâkpêk hi thil duoi am a nih?

16,"And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.","Chun, zântieng chun Jakob chu phûla inthawk chun a hung a, Leah chu a tuok dingin a va suok a, “I mi pâwl ding a nih, ka naupa zawldiaiin ka haw tlat ta che a nih,” a tih a. Chuongchun, chu zân chun a zâlpui tah a."

25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.","Rakilin Josef a hung nei chun, Jakobin Laban kuomah, “Ka umna pângngai, ka ram tienga ka fe theina dingin mîn fetir ta raw khai, i rawng ka bâwl san ka nuhmeihai le ka nauhai hi mi pe la, mîn fetir rawh."
26,"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.","I rawng ka bâwlpêk zie che hlak chu i hriet sih a,” a tih a."
27,"And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.","Laban chun a kuomah, “I mi lunginsiet thei chun la um phawt ta la, LALPA chun nanga zârah mal a mi sâwm ti aisânin ka hriet i sawnnaw,” a tih a."
28,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.","Chun, ama bawkin, “I hlaw ding chu mi hril la, chuongchun, pêng ka ti che,” a tih a."
29,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.","Ama chun, “Iengtin am i rawng ka bâwl a, ka enkawlna hnuoiah i ran chu iengtin am an um ti i hriet annâwm."
30,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?","Ka hung hma chun tlâwmte bak i nei a, tuhin chu tamtak an hung ni ta hi; ka nghatna tieng tieng LALPA chun mal a sâwmpêk pei che a nih: amiruokchu, iengtik am keia sûngkaw ta dingin suksuok vêng ka tih a?” a tih a."
31,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.","Chun, ama chun, “Ieng am pêng ka ti cheh a” a tih a. Jakob chun, “Iengkhawm i mi pêk ding a ni nawh; hi thil hi i mi thawpêk chun i ran ruol chu inthlain vêngpêk nâwk ka ti che."
32,"I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.","Vawisûn hin i ran ruol chu va en suok vawng ka ta, berâm laia a dumin a rawl le, a dum pheu pheu le, a dum taphawt le, kêl laia a vârin a rawl le, a vârin a rawl pheu pheu chu, chutaka inthawkin ṭhuoi tum ka ta; chun, tuta hnung chu chuong anga um chu ka hlaw ni sienla."
33,"So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.","Chuongchun, nakie ka hlaw dinghai en dinga i hung pha chun ka felna hin mi dawnpêk el a tih: kêl lai chun a vârin a rawl naw le, a vârin a rawl pheu pheu naw le, berâm laia a dum naw ka kuoma um i hmu taphawt chu ka inrûkah ruot el i tih,” a tih a."
34,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.","Laban chun, “A ṭha ie! i hril ang tak chun ni raw se,” a tih a."
35,"And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;","Chuongchun, chu ni tak chun kêlchal a vâra inzetan le, a vâra rawl pheu pheu po po le, kêlpui a vârin a rawl le, a vârin a rawl pheu pheu po po, a vâr ṭhang taphawt chu be- râm laia a dum po po le chun a ṭhuoi tum a, a naupasalhai kutah a pêk a."
36,and he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.,"Chun, ama le Jakob inkâra ni thum lama chun ân umtir a; chun, Jakob chun Laban ran ruol dang po po chu ân thla nâwk tah a."
37,"And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.","Chun, Jakobin hriengzau le almond thing le insething hmawl hring a lâk a, a hâwng a khawk vâr a, hmawlhaia chun a vâr chu a suklang a."
38,And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.,"A hmawl khawkna hâwnghai chu ran idâwn hlakna tui dâwnna thlênga dâm le, tui luongnaahai chun ran ruol hma peia chun a sieh a: chun, tui dâwn dinga an hung chun an hung inrai phut a."
39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.","Ran ruolhai chu hmawlhai zâwna chun an inrai phut a, a ze intan dâm, a ze chip nuk dâm, ân ze pheu pheu dâmin te an hung nei hlak a."
40,"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban’s flock.","Jakob chun berâmtehai chu a sie tum a; ran ruolhai chu Laban ran ruolhai lai a ze intan le a dum po po tieng chu ân nghattir a; ama ran ruolhai chu a sie tum hlak a, Laban ran ruol lai chu a sie nawh a."
41,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;","Ran hrât deuhai chu an hung inrai hlima, hmawl lai chun an inrai theina dingin, Jakob chun tui luongnaah, ran ruol mithmua chun hmawlhai chu a sie hlak a."
42,"but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.","Amiruokchu, ran chu an ṭan a ṭha naw chun a sie ngai nawh: chuongchun, a te ṭanṭha naw deu- hai chu Laban ta a hung ni pei a, a hrât deuhai chu Jakob ta a hung ni pei a."
43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.","Chuongchun, Jakob chu nasa- takin a hung pung a, ran ruol, ruol lientak dâm, suoknu le suokpa dâm, sanghâwngsei dâm, sabengtung dâm a hung nei tah a."
