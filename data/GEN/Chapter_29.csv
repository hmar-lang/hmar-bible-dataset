1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.","Chu hnunga chun Jakob chu a fe pei a, khawsak nauhai ram chu a hung tlung tah a."
2,"And he looked, and, behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and the stone upon the well’s mouth was great.","A hang en chun phûla tuisunsuo um hi a hmuh a, a kâwla chun berâm ruol thum hi an um zing a; chu tuisunsuoa inthawk chun berâm ruolhai chu tui an indâwntir hlak a nih: tuisunsuo kawta lung um chu a lien hle el a."
3,"And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in its place.","Chutaka chun berâm ruol po po chu an fe khâwm hlak a, tuisunsuo kawta lung chu an inhlum hmang a, berâmhai chu tui an indâwntir a, lung chu tuisunsuo kawta a umna pângngaia chun an sie nâwk hlak a."
4,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.","Jakob chun an kuomah, “Ka unauhai, khawtienga mi am in nih a?” a tih a. Anni chun, “Harana mi kan nih,” an tih a."
5,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.","Ama chun an kuomah, “Nahor naupa Laban in hriet am?” a tih a. Anni chun, “Hre e,” an tih a."
6,"And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.","Ama chun an kuomah, “A dam lai a ni?” a tih a. Anni chun, “A dam lai a nih ie, en ta, a naunu Rakil khawm berâm ṭhuoiin a hung saw,” an tih a."
7,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.","Ama chun, “Ngai ta u, nisa khawm a lân sâng hleh a, ran ṭhuoi khâwm khawm a la hun nawh a: berâmhai hi tui indâwntir unla vân thla ro khai,” a tih a."
8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.","Anni chun, “Thei naw ning ungah, berâm ruol po po an fe khâwm a, tuisunsuo kawta lung hi an inhlum sawn hmakhat chu; chu hnunga chun berâmhai chu tui kan indâwn tir hlak a nih,” an tih a."
9,"While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she kept them.",Anni a la biek lai chun Rakil chu a pa berâmhai ṭhuoiin a hung tlung a; ama chun a vêng hlak a nih a.
10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.","Chun, Jakob chun a nu ṭapa Laban naunu Rakil le, a nu ṭapa Laban berâm ruol chu a hmu chun a va hnai a, tuisunsuo kawta lung chu ân hlum hmang a, a nu ṭapa beramhai chu tui ân dâwntir tah a."
11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.","Chun, Jakobin Rakil chu a fâwp a, inringtakin a ṭap tah a."
12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.","Chun, Jakobin ama chu chu minu pa tupa a nizie le Rebeka naupa a nizie Rakil chu a hril a; chuong- chun, Rakil chu a tlân a, a pa a va hril tah a."
13,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.","Laban chu a farnu naupa Jakob chanchin a hriet chun, a tuok dingin a tlân a, a kuo a, a fâwp a, ama chu a inah a ṭhuoi tah a. Chun, Jakobin chuong thu po po chu Laban a hril tah a."
14,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.","Laban chun a kuomah, “Ka tisa le ka ru ngei i ni chu tie,” a tih a. Chun, thla khat a kuomah a um tah a."
15,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?","Chun, Labanin Jakob kuomah, “Ka tupa i ni leiin a thlâwnin ka rawng i bâwl ding am a nih? Iengam hlâwng i ta? mi hril raw khai,” a tih a."
16,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.","Laban chun naunuhmei pahni a nei a,a upa lem hming chu Leah a nih a, a naupang lem hming chu Rakil a nih."
17,And Leah’s eyes were tender; but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.,"Leah chu mitmeng inkhup deutak a nih a, Rakil ruok chu pieng ṭhatak, hmêl ṭhatak a nih."
18,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.","Jakob chun Rakil chu a hmangai a; chuongchun, “I naunu- hmei naupang lem Rakil hi nei dingin kum sari i rawng bâwlpêk ka ti che,” a tih a."
19,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.","Laban chun, “Ama chu mi dang kuoma ka pêk nêk chun i kuoma ka pêk chu ṭha lem a tih, ka kuomah um zing el rawh,” a tih a."
20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.","Jakob chun Rakil nei ding chun kum sari chu rawng a bâwl tah a, nisienlakhawm, Rakil chu a hmangai êm leiin ni sâwt nawte ang chauin a hriet a."
21,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.","Chun, Jakobin Laban kuomah, “Ka pâwl theina dingin ka nuhmei chu mi pe raw le, ka hun a kim ta sih a,” a tih a."
22,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.","Chuongchun, Laban chun chu khuoa mi po po chu a khâwm vawng a, ruoi a ṭheh a."
23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.","Chun, thimbut hin a naunu Leah chu a ṭhuoi a, Jakob kuomah a ṭhuoi lût a; ama chun a lo pâwl a."
24,And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.,(Laban chun a suoknu Zilpah chu a naunu Leah kuoma chun a suoknu dingin a pêk a).
25,"And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?","Chun, zîngtieng a hung ni chun Leah a lo ni zing el a; chuongchun, Jakobin Laban kuomah, “Ka chunga i thilthaw hi iengtizie am a nih a? Rakil nei dingin i rawng ka bâwl ni lo am a nih? Iengdinga i mi hlêm am?” a tih a."
26,"And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.","Laban chun, “Kan rama hin chuong anga nau a u hmaa a naupang lem infetir chu dân a ni nawh ie."
27,"Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.","A pakhata inneina chawlkâr chen chu tlingtla phawt la, chun, kum sari dang ka rawng i bâwl nâwk ding chun a dang khawm chu pêng kan ti che,” a tih a."
28,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.","Jakob chun chuong ang chun a thawh a, chu nu chawlkâr chu a tling- tlah a, chuongchun, a naunu Rakil chu a nuhmei dingin a pêk tah a."
29,And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.,(Laban chun a suoknu Bilha chu a naunu Rakil suoknu dingin a pêk a).
30,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.","Jakob chun Rakil khawm chu a pâwl a, Leah nêk chun Rakil chu a hmangai lem bawk a, Laban rawng chu kum sari dang a bâwl nâwk tah a."
31,"And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.","Chun, LALPAIN Leah chu theidain a um ti a hriet a, chuong- chun, a sul a hawngpêk a. Rakil ruok chu a ching a."
32,"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.","Chun, Leah chu ân rai a, naupasal a nei a, a hmingah Reuben a sak a: “LALPA chun ka rinumzie a hmu leiin a ni hi; tuhin chu ka pasalin mi hmangai tâng a tih,” a tih a."
33,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.","Chun, ân rai nâwk a, naupasal a nei nâwk a, “LALPA chun theidain ka um ti a hriet leiin hi khawm hi a mi pêk a ni hi,” a tih a; chuongchun, a hmingah Simeon a sak a."
34,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.","Chun, ân rai nâwk a, naupasal a nei nâwk a, “Tu zêt hin chu naupasal pathum ka neipêk tah a, ka pasalin mi zâwm tâng a tih,” a tih a: chuleiin, a hmingah Levi sak a nih a."
35,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, This time will I praise Jehovah: therefore she called his name Judah; and she left off bearing.","Chun, ân rai nâwk a, naupasal a nei nâwk a, “Tuta ṭum hin chu LALPA chu inpâk ka tih,” a tih a; chuleiin, a hmingah Juda a sak a, chu hnung chun nau a nei nâwk ta nawh."
