1,"And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.","Chun, LALPAIN Noa kuoma chun, “Nang le i sûnghai po po chu lawngah lût ro; nang chu tulai ṭhangthar lai hin ka mithmuin mi feltak i nih ti ka hriet che a nih."
2,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:","Sa thieng tinrêng laia mi, a chal le a kawppui a pui seng leh, tuok sari peiin i kuomah ṭhuoi i ta, sa thieng- naw laia mi, a chal le a kawppui, a pui seng leh tuok khat peiin."
3,"of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.","Chunglêng vate laia mi khawm, a pui le a chal seng, tuok sari peiin, hnuoi chung po poa chi thla dinga hring dingin i ṭhuoi ding a nih."
4,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground.","Ni sari a la bâk a, chu hnunga chun hnuoi chunga hin ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli sûng ruo insûrtir ka ta; ka thilhring siem tinrêng hi hnuoi chunga inthawkin sukbohmang ka tih,” a ta."
5,And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.,"Chuongchun, Noa chun LALPAIN a kuoma thu a pêk ang pei chun a thaw tah a."
6,And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.,"Chun, hnuoia tui a hung lêt lai chun Noa chu kum za ruk mi a nih."
7,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.","Chun, tui a hung lêt ding a ni lei chun Noa chu lawnga chun a lût a, a naupasalhai le a nuhmei le a nauhai nuhmeihai khawm an lût ve a."
8,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,","Sa thieng laia mi le, sa thiengnaw laia mi le, vate laia mi le, hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn tinrêng laia mi khawm,"
9,"there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.","a pui le a chal a tuok peiin Pathienin Noa kuoma thu a pêk ang khan, Noa kuomah lawngah an lût tah a."
10,"And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.","Chun, ni sari hnunga chun hnuoia hin tui chu a hung lêt tah a."
11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.","Noa chu kum za ruk a ni kum, a thla hnina ni sâwm le ni sari niah, chu ni ngei chun tui inthûk lientak hnâr po po chu a hung pût ta vawng a, vân tukverhai khawm a hung inhawng ta bawk a."
12,And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.,"Chun, ni sâwmli le zân sâwmli sûng chu hnuoia hin ruopui nasatak a sûr tah a."
13,"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;","Chu ni ngei chun Noa le a naupasalhai Sem, Ham, Japheth le Noa nuhmei chu lawnga chun an lût tah a, a naupasalhai nuhmei pa- thum khawm an kuomah an lût veh a;"
14,"they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.","anni chu an lût a, sa tinrêng mâni chi um dân ang sengin, ran po po mâni chi um dân ang sengin, thilhring hnuoia bawkinvâka lâwn chi tinrêng mâni chi um dân ang sengin, vate tinrêng mâni chi um dân ang sengin, vate thla nei tinrêng chu an lût seng bawk a."
15,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.","Chuongchun, tisa po po hringna thuok nei taphawt chu a tuok peiin Noa kuomah lawnga chun an lût tah a."
16,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in.","Chun, a lûthai chu Pathienin a kuoma thu a pêk angin, tisa nei laia mi tinrêng chu a pui le a chal a tuok peiin an lût a; chun, LALPAIN ama chu a khâr khum tah a."
17,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.","Chun, tui chu hnuoia hin ni sâwmli sûng po a lêt a, tui chu a hung pung a, lawng chu a hung lên kâng a, hnuoi chunga chun a chîm lâng pei tah a."
18,"And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.","Tui chu a hung um ta puou a, hnuoi chunga hin a hung pung rak el tah a, lawng chu tui chunga chun ân lâng pei a."
19,And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.,"Chun, hnuoi chunga hin tui chu nasatakin a hung um puou el tah a, vân hnuoia tlâng insânghai po po chu a chîm zo tah a."
20,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.,"Tawng sâwmpanga zeta in- sângin tui chu a hung um ta puou el a, tlânghai chu a tlum hmang ta dai a."
21,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:","Chuongchun, tisa hnuoia chângthei po po, vate dâm, ran dâm, sa dâm, thilhring hnuoi chunga bawk- invâka lâwn tinrêng dâm, mihriem tinrêng leh an thi zo vawng tah a;"
22,"all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.","an hnâra hringna thlarau thuok umna po po, khawmuola um ta- phawthai chu an thi ta vawng a."
23,"And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark.","Chuongchun, hnuoi chunga thil hringna nei tinrêng, mihriem dâm, ran dâm, thilhring bawkinvâk chi dâm, chunglêng vate dâm, hnuoia inthawka sukbohmangin an um tah a: Noa le a kuoma lawnga umhai chau chu hlain an um tah a."
24,And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.,"Chun, tui chu ni za le sâwmnga sûng po chu hnuoia hin a um ta puou el a."
