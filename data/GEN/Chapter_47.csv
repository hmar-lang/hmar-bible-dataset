1,"Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.","Chun, Josef chun Pharao chu a hang hril a, “Ka pa le ka unauhai, an berâm ruol dâm, an ran ruol dâm, an nei po po leh Kanaan rama inthawkin an hung tlung thla tah a: tuhin Gosen ramah an um,” a tih a."
2,"And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.","Chun, a unauhai laia mi panga a ṭhuoi a, Pharao chu ân hrietttir a."
3,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.","Pharao chun a unauhai kuoma chun, “Ieng sin am in thaw a?” a tih a. Anni chun Pharao kuomah, “I siehlawhai hi kan thlatuhai chenah berâm vêngtuhai kan nih,” an tih a."
4,"And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants’ flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.","Anni bawk chun Pharao kuomah, “Hi rama um phawt ding hin kan hung a nih: kan ramah i siehlawhai berâm ruolhai fâk ding a um ta si nawh, ṭâm hi Kanaan ramah a tla nasa hle sih a; chuleiin, lunginsiettakin i siehlawhai hi Gosen ramah mîn umtir rawh,” an tih a."
5,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:","Chun, Pharao chun Josef a biek a, “I pa le i unauhai hi i kuomah an hung tah a."
6,"the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.","Aigupta ram chu a um duoi annâwm: i pa le i unauhai chu ram ṭhatna lailiah umhmun inkhuortir ta la, Gosen ramah umhmun khuor raw se; chun, anni laia mi thilthawtheitak hriet i nei lem chun ka ran chungah hotuah siem rawh,” a tih a."
7,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.","Chun, Josef chun a pa Jakob chu a ṭhuoi lût a, Pharao hmaa chun ân ngîrtir a: chuongchun, Jakob chun Pharao chu mal a sâwm tah a."
8,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?","Chun, Pharaoin Jakob kuomah, “Kum iengzat am i ni tah a?” a tih a."
9,"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.","Jakob chun Pharao kuomah, “Ka khuol inzin kum chen chu kum za le sâwmthum a nih a, ka dam sûng kumhai hi a tlâwmin a rimsikthlâk a nih, a mi thlatuhai an khuol inzin laia an dam sûng kum khawm a zât ve bawk nawh,” a tih a."
10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.","Chun, Jakobin Pharao chu mal a sâwm nâwk a, Pharao kuoma inthawk chu a suok tah a."
11,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.","Chun, Josef chun a pa le a unauhai chu umhmun ân khuortir a, Pharao thupêk angin, Aigupta rama ram ṭhatak laia Rameses rama chun ro dingin ram a pêk a."
12,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to their families.","Chun, Josef chun a pa le a unauhai le a pa sûnghai po po chu, an sûngkuo ang peiin fâk ding a pêk a, a châwm tah a."
13,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.","Chun, chu ram po poa chun fâk ding hrim a um ta nawh a, ṭâm a tla nasa hle sih a; chuongchun, ṭâm lei chun Aigupta le Kanaan ram chu a chau tah a."
14,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.","Josef chun an bu inchâwkna manah Aigupta ram le Kanaan rama tangka um po po chu ân khâwm pêk zo vawng tah a; chun, Josef chun chu tangka chu Pharao inah a hung chawi a."
15,"And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.","Chun, Aigupta ram le Kanaan rama tangka po po an hmang zo hnung chun Aigupta mi po po chu Josef kuoma chun an hung a, “Fâk ding mi pe raw khai, i hmaa hin kan thi el ding am a nih? tangka hlak a um ta si nawh a,” an tih a."
16,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.","Chun, Josef chun, “In ranhai hung pe el ro, in ranhai manah fâk ding pêng ka ti cheu,” a tih a."
17,"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.","Chuongchun, an ranhai chu Josef kuomah an hung ṭhuoi a; Josef chun chuong sakawrhai, berâm ruolhai, bâwng ruolhai le sabeng- tunghai mana chun fâk ding a pêk pei a: chu kum chun an ran po po manah fâk ding a pêk a, a châwm tâwl tah a."
18,"And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord’s; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:","Chu kum chu ân vawi a, kum a hung thar chun an hung nâwk a, a kuomah, “Pu, kan tangka po po kan hmang zo tâkzie le, kan ran ruolhai i ta a ni tâkzie hi, pu, i kuoma hin ip naw ning ungah: pu, i mithmua hin kan ramhai le kan tisa bak naw chu iengkhawm a um ta dêr nawh a;"
19,"wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.","i hmaa hin keini le kan ram hi kan bohmang el ding am a nih? Keini hi kan ram pumin fâk dingin mîn chaw rawh; chuongchun, keini le kan ram hi Pharao siehlawhai ni el kan tih: chun, thi loa dama kan um theina ding le, ram hi mâk a ni nawna dingin bu chi mi pe bawk la,” an tih a."
20,"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh’s.","Chuongchun, Josef chun Pharao ta dingin Aigupta ram po po chu ân châwkpêk tah a; ṭâm chu an chunga a tlung nasa bêk leiin Aigupta mihai chun an lo chu an zawr sih a. Chuongchun, ram chu Pharao ta a ni ta vawng a."
21,"And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.",Mihriemhai chu Aigupta ramri khingtieng tâwpa inthawka khing- tieng tâwp chenin khuoahai chun ân tâwltir tâwl tah a.
22,"Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.","Thiempuhai ram bak ân châwk nawh a; thiempuhai chun Pharaoa inthawk chanvo an nei a, Pharaoin an chanvo a pêk chu an fâk hlak a nih: chuleiin, an ram chu an zawr ve nawh a."
23,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.","Chu hnunga chun Josef chun mihai kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, vawisûn hin nangni hi in ram pumin Pharao ta dingin kân châwk ta cheu a, hi, hitaka hi in ta ding bu chi a um hi, hnuoiah chîng ro."
24,"And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.","Chun, bu lâk pha chun Pharao ta dingin hmun ngaa ṭheha hmun khat pei pêng in ta, a hmun li chu nangni ta nîng a tih, in chîng nâwk ding, in fâk ding le in nau le tehai fâk dingin,” a tih a."
25,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.","Chun, anni chun, “Nangin kan hringna hi i sanhim tah a: pu, mi lunginsiet la, Pharao siehlaw ni el kan tih,” an tih a."
26,"And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh’s.","Chuongchun, Josef chun Pha- raoin hmun ngaa ṭheha hmun khat a hmu pei ding thu hi, Aigupta ram ta dingin tu chen hin dânah a siem tah a: thiempuhai ram bak chu a nih Pharao ta ni lo chu."
27,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.","Chuongchun, Israelhai chun Aigupta rama Gosen rama chun umhmun an khuor tah a; chutaka chun an insukmuk a, chi tamtak an thlah a, nasatakin an pung tah a."
28,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.","Chun, Jakob chu Aigupta rama chun kum sâwmpasari a um a; chuongchun, Jakob dam sûng kum chu kum za le sâwmli pasari a nih."
29,"And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;","Chun, Israel thi hun ding chu a hung hnai tah a; chuongchun, a naupa Josef chu a ko a, a kuomah, “I mi lunginsiet thei chun, lungin- siettakin i kut kha ka êlpui hnuoiah rawl la, ka chungah thuzâwmtak le indiktaka thaw dingin intiem rawh. Aiguptaa hin mi phûm lul naw rawh."
30,"but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.","A mi thlatuhai kuoma ka in pha chun nangin Aiguptaa inthawk hin mi zâwn dawkin, anni phûmna hmunah i mi phûm lem ding a nih,” a tih a. Ama chun, “I hril ang hin hung thâwng ka tih,” a tih a."
31,"And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.","Chun, ama chun, “Ka kuomah inkhâm raw le,” a tih a; chuongchun, a kuomah ân khâm tah a. Chun, Israel chu khum lu sikin a kûn tah a."
