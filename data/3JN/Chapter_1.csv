2,"Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.","Dittak, i thlarau chun malsâwm- na a hmu angin, iengkima malsâwm- na i hmu le i dam theina dingin ka ṭawngṭai hlak a nih."

10,"Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth them out of the church.","Chuleiin, ka hung chun chu a thilthawhai inhriet suoktir nâwk ka tih, kan chungthu suol hrilin a bautamzie hi; chu khawm chu hun a ti nawh a, ama ngeiin unauhai a lâwm nawh a, a lâwm nuomhai khawm a khap a, kohrana inthawkin a hnawt dawk hlak."
