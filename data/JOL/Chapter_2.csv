1,"Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;","Ziona chun tawtawrâwt mût unla, ka tlâng inthienga chun inrâl- ringna sukri ro, hi ram sûnga mi po pohai chu inthin raw se; LALPA ni chu a hung tlung mêk a, a hnai ta sih a;"
2,"a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.","inthimna le vâninnîmna ni, sûm zîng ni le inthim sâ ni, tlâng chunga vârtle var rên ruon ang; mipui nasa- tak le hrâttak, chuong ang la um ngai lo, chuong hnunga suon tamtak chen khawma um nâwk ta ngailo ding chu."
3,"A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.","An hmatieng chu meiin a kâng fai a, an hnungtieng meichawkin a hlieu bawk a; an hmaa ram chu Eden huon ang a nih; an hnungtieng chu thlalêr ram ṭâwl a nih, ieng- khawmin chuong chu an pumpel ta nawh."
4,"The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.",An inlang dân chu sakawr inlang dân ang a nih; sakawr chuong mi angin an tlân a.
5,"Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.","Indona tawlailîr ri angin tlâng chunga chun an kat sup sup a, pâwl kâng chawk dur dur ang le indonaa mipui hrâttak inzosa angin."
6,At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.,"An hmaa mipuihai chu an thla- phâng a, an hmêlhai chu a hung dâng vawng tah a."
7,"They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.","Mi hrâttak angin an tlân a, indo mi angin bangah an lâwn a; mâni zâwn sengah an feh a, an intlar dân an sukbuoi nawh."
8,"Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off their course.","An inhneng bawk nawh a, mâni lampui sengah an feh a, hriemhreihai an nêrthleng a, an fe pêt nawh."
9,They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.,Khawpui chunga chun an in- châwm a; kul chungah an tlân a; in sûngahai chun an hang lâwn a; inru angin tukverahai an lût a.
10,"The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.","An hmaa chun hnuoi khawm ân thin a; vânhai ân hnîng a; nisa le thla chu an inthim a, arasihai chun an var an thup a:"
11,And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?,"LALPA chun a sipai ruolhai hmaa chun râwl ân suoh a, a rie- bûkhai chu a ropui hle sih a; a thu muolsuotu chu a hrât hle sih a. LALPA ni chu a ropuiin a râpthlâk êm êm sih a; tuin am tuor thei a ta?"
12,"Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:","LALPA chun, “Chuong sa khawmin tuhin in lungril po poin, bu ngheiin, ṭapin, lungngaiin keia tieng hung ngha unla;"
13,"and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.","in puon ni loin, in lungril thlêr ro,” a tih. LALPA in Pathien tieng chu ngha ro: ama chu lunginsiet theitak le lainatnaa sip, lunginuoi le zainêm- naa sip, thil ṭha naw chu inlêt hlak a nih."
14,"Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?","LALPA in Pathien kuomah, bei- phit inhlân le dâwn ding inhlânahai khawm chun, kîrin lungril inlêtin, malsâwmna mâksanin um naw ni ti tuin am a hriet a?"
15,"Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;","Ziona chun tawtawrâwt mût unla, bu nghei hun inserthieng ro; inkhâwmpui ursûntak chu siem ro,"
16,"gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.","mipui inkhâwm unla, in- khâwmpuihai chu sukthieng unla, tarsiehai, naupanghai, nenê ne laihai kei khâwm unla, moneitu chu a pin- dana inthawkin hung suok sienla, mo khawm a pindan sûngrila inthawk chun hung suok raw se."
17,"Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?","Thiempu, LALPA rawngbâwl- tuhai chu, tuolpûk le mâichâm inkâra chun ṭap sienla, “Aw LALPA i mihai hla la, i rochanhai hi hrilsieta uma hnamhaiin an chunga ro an rêlpêk dingin pe naw rawh: ‘An Pathien chu khâw lai am a um ta leh,’ tiin an mipuihai lai chun ieng dingin am tîng an ta?” ti raw se."
18,"Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.","LALPA chun a ram chu a thîk a, a mihai chu a lunginsiet a."
19,"And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;","LALPA chun a dawn a, a mihai kuomah, “Ngai unla, in kuomah bu dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm hung in- tlun ka ta, chuonghaia chun tlai in ta: hnamhai laia chun hrilsietin inumtir nâwk ta naw ning cheu a:"
20,"but I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.","amiruokchu, in kuoma in- thawkin hmârtieng sipai ruol chu sawnhmang dai ka ta, ram ṭâwl le râusannaah infetir ka tih, a hmasa pâwl saktieng tuisuorietah, a nu- hnung pâwl thlangtieng tuisuorietah; hung ṭhuoi suok a ta, rimsetakin hung innam a tih, thil nasatak a thaw ta leiin."
21,"Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.","Aw ram, ṭi naw la, hlimin lâwm rawh, LALPA chun thil ropuitakhai a thaw ta sih a."
22,"Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.","Ranhai, ṭi naw ro, thlalêr hlobet hmun a hung inder a; thing chu a hung rah a, theichang kûng le grêp- hruihai chu a hung inno sih a."
23,"Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first month.","Nangni Zion nauhai, lâwm ro, LALPA in Pathiena chun hlim ro; ruo hmasa chu inkhi chiein a pêk si cheu a, in ta dingin ruo ân sûrtir a, thla khatnaa ruo hmasa le ruo nuhnung chu."
24,"And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.","Ṭuonghai chu buin hung sip a ta, uoin le hriek chu bêlahai chun sip liem a ta."
25,"And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.","Nangni laia ka sipai ruol tamtak ka itir, tawktawngang dâm, khâuṭhikṭhi dâm, thingnge dâm, tuktulung dâmin an fâk zo kumhai kha thung nâwk ka ti cheu."
26,"And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.","Tamtak nei in ta, tlai in tih, maktaka ngaituo hlaktu cheu LALPA in Pathien hming chu inpâk in ta, ka mihai chu muolpho hrim hrim naw ni hai."
27,"And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.","Chun, Israelhai lai hin ka um ti le, LALPA in Pathien ka na, tu dang khawm an um nawh ti hrieng in tih; ka mihai chu muolpho nâwk ta naw ni hai."
28,"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:","“Chu hnunga chun mi po po chungah ka thlarau buok ka ta; chuongchun, in naupasalhaiin, in naunuhmeihaiin ka thu hril an ta, in tarhaiin mangah mang an ta, in tlangvâlhaiin inlârnahai hmûng an ta:"
29,and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.,chuong niahai chun suokpahai le suoknuhai chunga khawm ka thlarau buok ka tih.
30,"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.","Vâna le hnuoiahai thilmak- hai inhmutir ka ta, thisen dâm, meikhu dâm, meikhu ngîr dâm leh."
31,"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.","Nisa inthimin inchang a ta, thla chu thisenah inchang a ta, LALPA ni ropuitak le râpthlâktak chu a hung tlung hma chun."
32,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.","Chun, hieng ang hi nîng a ta, tukhawm LALPA hming lam taphawt chu sanhim nîng an tih; LALPAIN a hril ang khan a tlânsuokhai chu Zion tlânga le Jerusalem khuoah an um âwm sih a, chu hai lai chun LALPAIN a kohai chu ṭhang an tih.”"
