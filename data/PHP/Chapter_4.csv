verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.","Chuleiin, ka unau dittak le ka ngaitak, ka lâwmna le ka lallukhumhai, chuong ang chun Lalpaah ngîr det ro, ka dittakhai."
2,"I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.","Lalpaa chun lungril hmunkhat put dingin Eodi ka ngên a, Suntuki khawm ka ngên bawk a nih."
3,"Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.","Anih, nang khawm ka rîngkawl bâtpui tak, ka fiel bawk che, kha nuhmeihai kha ṭhangpui rawh. Chanchin Ṭhaa chun an mi thawpui hlak sih a; Klemen le ka sinthawpui dang Hringna bua hming chuonghai le khan."
4,"Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.","Lalpaa chun lâwm rawp ro, ti nâwk hlak ka tih lâwm ro. In zaidawtheizie mi po po hriet ni raw se."
5,Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.,"Lalpa chu a hnai a, ienga khawm lunginzing naw ro."
6,In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.,Iengkimah ṭawngṭai le hniin lâwmthu hrilsa peiin in dithai chu Pathien kuomah inhriettirin um lem raw se.
7,"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.","Chuongchun, Pathien thlamuon- na, lungril hrim hrima hriet sênglo khan, in lungril le in ngaituonahai chu Krista Isua chun vêngpêk a ti cheu."
8,"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.","A tâwp taka chun, unauhai, ân dik taphawt dâm, ân zâum taphawt dâm, a fel taphawt dâm, ân thieng taphawt dâm, a ditum taphawt dâm, ân thang mawi taphawt dâm, ṭhatna hrim hrim a um a, inpâkna hrim hrim a um chun, chuong chu ngaituo ro."
9,"The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.","Keimaa thil in inchûka in pawmhai dâm, in hmua in hriethai dâm, khâng thil kha thaw hlak ro. Chuongchun, Lungmuongna Pathien chun umpui a ti cheu."
10,"But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ta dinga in ngaituona chu tûta in hung thâwthar nâwk ta leiin, Lalpaa chun ka lâwm hle a nih; chuong ang kawng chu ngaituo kha chu in ngaituo hleh a, remchâng ruok chu in hmu naw mei a ni kha."
11,"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.","Ka tlâksamna thu hril chu ka ni nawh a, a kei chu ieng ang khawmin um lang lungawi pei ka chîng ta sih a."
12,"I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.","Tlâwmtaka um dân ka thiem a, hausaa um dân khawm ka thiem bawk a, thil tinrêng le thil po poa tlai le phîngṭama um dân, hausa le tlasama um dân thurûk chu ka hriet suok tah."
13,I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.,A mi sukhrâttu Krista zâra chun iengkim ka thaw thei a nih.
14,Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.,"Nisienlakhawm, ka lunginzîng- naa in mi lo lunginzîngpui hi in thaw ṭha ngawt el."
15,"And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;","Chun, nangni Philippia mihai, Chanchin Ṭha tlung hlim laia Makedonia rama inthawka ka fe suok lai khan, nangni chau naw chun, ko- hran pakhat khawmin thil, pêk le dawng kawngah an mi ṭhangpui nawh ti nangni ngeiin in hriet bawk a."
16,for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.,"Thessalonikaa ka um lai khawm khan, ka tlâksamna phuhrûk dingin vawi khat chau ni loin, vawi hni lai in hung inphur kha,"
17,Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.,"Thilpêk chu zawng ka ni nawh a, ra nangni tienga pung ding chu zawng ka ni lem."
18,"But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.","Nisienlakhawm, iengkim ka nei a, ka hau a nih: Epaphrodita kuta in iengkhat hung inphurhai kha ka lo hmu a, ka phuiinsui tah. Chuongchu thil riminhnik rim, inthâwina dawn tlâk, Pathien lâwm zâwng a nih."
19,And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.,"Chun, ka Pathien chun Krista Isua a ropuina hauzie ang peiin, in tlâksamna tinrêng khawm phuhrûk- pêk a ti cheu."
20,Now unto our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.,Ei Pathien le ei Pa kuoma chun kumkhuoin ropuina chu um raw se. Amen.
21,Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.,Krista Isua mi inthieng tinrêng chibai mi bûkpêk ro. Ka kuoma unau umhai hin chibai an bûk cheu a.
22,"All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Cæsar’s household.",Mi inthieng po poin chibai an bûk cheu a; abîktakin Kaisar sûnghai laia mihai hin an bûk cheu a nih.
23,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.,Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna chu in thlarau kuomah um raw se.
