1,"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:","Paula le Timothe, Krista Isu suokhai chun: Krista Isua mi inthieng Philippia um po pohai kuomah, kohran hotuhai le rawngbâwltuhai kuoma leh:"
2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka hmangaina le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
3,"I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,","Ka hrietsuok po cheu leh ka Pathien kuomah lâwm thu ka hril hlak a,"
4,"always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,","nangni po po ka ṭawngṭaipêkna taphawt cheua chun hlimtakin ka hni hlak a nih,"
5,for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;,ni hmasataka inthawk khan tu chen hin Chanchin Ṭha puong darnaah in ṭhang ve zing leiin.
6,"being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:",Nangnia thilṭha thaw phuttu khan Isu Krista ni chen chun a thaw famkim pei ding a nih; chu ngei chu ka ring tlat sih a.
7,"even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.","Nangni po po tienga chuong ang lungril put chu keia ta ding chun a âwm hrim a nih, lungrila ka vawn cheu leiin; ka kawl bunnahai, Chanchin Ṭha thiemna thu ka hrilna le ka sukdetnahaia khawm in rêngin lunginsietna chu a mîn ṭâwmpui- tuhai in ni sih a."
8,"For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.","Krista Isu lainatna chun in rêngin ka ngaizie cheu chu, Pathien a mi hrepuitu a nih in sawnnaw."
9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;",In hmangaina chun hriet fam- kimna le bengvârna tinrêng a hau nâwk zuolna dingin ka ṭawngṭai hlak hi;
10,so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;,"Chuongchun, Krista nia chun inthieng le sawisêlbo in ni theina dingin, thil ṭha bîkhai chu ṭha ti thei in ta,"
11,"being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.",Pathien ropuina le inpâkna ding Isu Krista zâra felna ra chun hung sip thei in tih.
12,"Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;","Unauhai, ka chunga thil hung tlunghai kha Chanchin Ṭha suk- darna ding a hung ni ta lem hlau ti in hriet ka nuom a nih."
13,"so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole prætorian guard, and to all the rest;","Chuongchun, ka kawl bunnahai hi Praitorian sipai pâwl po po lai le mi dang po po kuoma chun Krista lei a nih ti ân lang suok tah."
14,"and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.","Lalpaa unau tam lemhai khawm chun ka kawl bunnahai leia lo awi tlatin, ṭi loin Pathien thu hril kawngah an huoi nasa zuol a nih."
15,Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:,"Ṭhenkhat chun îtthîk le sêlna lei khawmin Krista thu an hril hlak, ṭhenkhat ruok chun lâwm leiin an hril bawk hlak:"
16,"the one do it of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;","pâwl khat chun, Chanchin Ṭha thiemna thu hril dinga ruot ka nih ti hrein lunginsiet leiin an hril hlak a nih,"
17,"but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.","pâwl dang ruok chun, ka kawl bun chunga hin lungngaina mi belsapêk tumin, titaktak ni loin, êsêlna leiin Krista thu an hril lem hlak."
18,"What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.","Iengtizie am a na? Ieng dang khawm a ni nawh a, kawng tin- rêngah, atehlêmin amanih, atakin amanih, Krista thu hrilin a um hrim hrim a nih, chuonga chun ka lâwm a, anih, la lâwm pei ka tih."
19,"For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,",Chu chu in mi ṭawngṭaipêkna lei le Isu Krista Thlarau a mi pêk leiin ka sandamna hung ning a tih ti ka hriet sih a.
20,"according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.","Ka beiseina le ka înhâwkna ang peiin ienga khawm sukmuolphoin um naw ningah a, huoitakin, ka um pângngai ang rawpin, tu khawm hin, hringna leiin amanih, thina leiin amanih, ka taksaa hin Krista chu chawimawiin a um ding a nih."
21,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.","Ka ta ding chun hring hi Krista a ni sih a, thi khawm hlâwkna a nih."
22,"But if to live in the flesh,—if this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.","Nisienlakhawm, tisaa hring hi ka chan ni sienla, chu chu ka sinthaw ra ni ta ang sien, chuongchun, a ieng am ka thlang lem ding chu ka hriet nawh."
23,"But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:","Chamlakin a ngaina hre loin ka um el a nih, fe suoka Krista kuoma um inhâwkna ka nei leiin, chu chu a ṭha lem bêk bêk sih a."
24,yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.,"Nisienlakhawm, nangni leiin taksaa um zing hi a ṭûl lem a nih."
25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;","Chu chu ka ring tlat leiin um zing ka tih ti ka hriet a nih, ringnaa chun in hung inṭhang lienna ding le in lâwmna dingin in rênga kuomah um zing ka tih ti ka hriet;"
26,that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.,"chuongchun, in kuoma ka um nâwk ding leiin in mi suongna chu Krista Isua a nasat nâwkzuol theina dingin."
27,"Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;","Iengkhawm ni sienla, in um dân chu Krista Chanchin Ṭha leh inmawi phawt raw se. Chuongchun, nangni hung kan inla cheu khawm, in kuomah um naw lang khawm, thla- rau hmunkhata ngîr tlatin, lungril hmunkhata Chanchin Ṭha ringna thu ṭana thâtak sangin in um ti in chanchin lo hre thei ka tih."
28,"and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;","Ieng kawnga khawm dotuhai sukṭitin in um nawh a, chu chu anni ta ding chun bohmang ding an nih ti inhriettirna fietak a nih, nangni ta ding ruok chun sandam ding in nih ti inhriettirna fietak a ni lem a; chu khawm chu Pathiena inthawk a nih."
29,"because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:","Krista leia ama in ring chau ni loin, ama leia in tuor khawm phal a ni sih a,"
30,"having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.","indona keimaa in hmu hlak, tu khawm hin keimaa a um ti in ihriet, chu ngei chu in nei ve ta hi."
