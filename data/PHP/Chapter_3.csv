1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.","A tâwp taka chun, unauhai, Lalpaa chun lâwm ro. Thu pângngai in kuoma ziek rawp hi keia ta ding chun nghawkum a ni nawh, nangni ta dingin a ṭhahnem bawk sih a."
2,"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:","Uihai laia chun fîmkhur ro, thil ṭha naw thawtuhai laia chun fîmkhur ro, mâni taksa sukrimsi hlakhai laia chun fîmkhur ro."
3,"for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:","Eini Pathien Thlarau zâra Pa- thien bie le, Krista Isu suong le, taksa chunga ringna innghat nawhai hi, Sertanhai ei ni lem sih a."
4,"though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:","Nuom lang lem chu kei khawm tisa chunga ringna innghat thei ka nih in sawnnaw. Mi dang hrim hrimin tisa chunga ringna innghatna neia an inngai chun, kei kân ngai nâwk zuol a nih."
5,"circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;","Ni riet nia sertan, Israel suona mi, Benjamin chia mi, Hebrai kâra Hebraia insieng ka nih; dân tienga chu Pharisai ka nih,"
6,"as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.",ṭhahnemngai tienga chun ko- hranhai suknawmnatu ka nih; Dân thua felna tienga chun sawisêlbo ka nih.
7,"Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.","Nisienlakhawm, ka ta dinga hlâwkna ding po po chu, chuong chu Krista leiin chânnaah ka ngai a nih:"
8,"Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,","A ni takzet el, ka Lalpa Isu Krista hrietna ropui bîk leiin, thil tinrêng khawm chânnaah ka ngai a nih; ama lei chun thil po po ka chân ta vawng a, chuongchu hnephnâwl ang chauah ka ngai a nih."
9,"and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, even that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:","Hi lei hin a nih: Amaa ka um theina ding le, mâni felna (Dâna felna) ringawt nei loa, Krista ringna leia felna, (ringna leia Pathiena inthawka felna) chu nei lemin;"
10,"that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;","Krista le a thonâwkna thil- thawtheina chu ka hriet chieng theina ding le a tuornahai inṭawm- puia, a thinaa ama ang ka hung ni theina dingin;"
11,if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.,mi thi laia inthawka thonâwkna chu ka chang thei duoiin tiin.
12,"Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.","Hmu ta zing inti ka ni nawh a, famkim ta zing inti khawm ka ni bawk nawh, “Krista mi manna san chu ka man thei duoiin,” tiin a hnawtin ka hnawt lem a nih. Unauhai, manah ka lân ngai nawh."
13,"Brethren, I count not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,","Amiruokchu, hi thil pakhat hi ka thaw hlak–Hnungtienga thil umhai chu theinghila hmatienga thil umhai chu banin,"
14,I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.,"Krista Isua Pathien chungtieng kona san lâwmman hmu dingin, tiem chin tieng chu ka pan ṭâl ṭâl a nih."
15,"Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you:","Chuongchun, puitling taphawt chu chuong ang lungril putin um ei tiu; chun, ieng kawnga khawm lungril danglam put in lo ni chun, chu khawm chu Pathienin lân hriettir a ti cheu."
16,"only, whereunto we have attained, by that same rule let us walk.","Iengkhawm ni sien la, ei phâk chin ang pei hi sukdikin, chutaka inthawk chun fe pei ei tiu."
17,"Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.","Unauhai, ka um dân inchûk- tuhai lo ni tâwl ro; chun, enkhi ding keini in mi nei a, chuong ang peia umhai chu en ṭha ro."
18,"For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:","Mi tamtak an feh a, chuhai chu Krista kraws hmêlma an ni ti an chanchin ka hril rawp cheu kha, tu khawm hin ṭap pumin ka hril cheu hi."
19,"whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.","Chuonghai tâwpna chu bo- hmangna a nih, an Pathien chu an phîng a nih, an ropuina khawm chu an muolphona a nih, khawvêl thil an dit hlak a nih."
20,"For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:",Eini chu vân khuoletuihai ei ni sih a. Sandamtu Lal Isu Krista hung ding chu ei nghâk zing a nih.
21,"who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.","Ama chun a sinthawin iengkim khawm ama thu thuin ân umtir thei, chu thawzie ang pei chun ei tlâwmlai taksa hi, ama taksa ropui anga um dingin siem ṭha nâwk a tih."
