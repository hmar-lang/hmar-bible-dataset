verse_no,en,hmr
1,"If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,","Chuongchun, Kristaah lung- muongna hrim hrim dâm, hmangai thlamuongna hrim hrim dâm, Thlarau pâwlna hrim hrim dâm, lainatna le lunginsietna hrim hrim dâm a um chun,"
2,"make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;","lungril hmunkhata umin, hma- ngaina hmunkhat neiin, inthuruola lungril hmunkhata umin, ka lâwmna sukfamkim ro."
3,"doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;","Esêlna le inngaihlut leia ieng- khawm thaw loin, mi tinin inngai- tlâwmtakin mâni nêkin mi dang ṭha lemah ngai seng raw hai se."
4,"not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.","Mâni ta ta chau en loin, mi dang ta khawm en seng lem ro."
5,"Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:","Hi lungril, Krista Isu khawma um kha, nangniah um raw se."
6,"who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,","Ama chu Pathien nina neia um zing ni sien khawm, Pathien tluka um zing chu, tum lui tlat dingah a ngai nawh a,"
7,"but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;","mihriemhai anga hung insiengin, suok angin ân siem a, ama le ama ân suktlâwm ta lem a."
8,"and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.","Chun, mihriem anga hung umin ân ngaitlâwm a, thi khawp raka thu zâwmin a lo um tah a, krawsa thina ngei chu."
9,"Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;","Chuleichun, Pathienin ama chu nasatakin a chawimawi ve thung tah a, hming po poa hming chunghnung- tak chu a pêk tah a;"
10,"that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth,","Isu hminga mi tin, vâna mihai, hnuoia mihai, hnuoi hnuoia mihai leh, an dingṭhaṭhuonna ding le,"
11,"and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.","Pa Pathien sukropuina dingin, “Isu Krista chu Lal a nih,” tia lei tinrêngin a puongna dingin."
12,"So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;","Chuongchun, ka idittakhai, thu in zâwm rawp ang khan, ka um lai chau ni loin, tûta ka um naw kâr hin nasa lem hmanin, ṭi le inthin pumin in sandamna thaw suok ro,"
13,"for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.",ama lâwmna dinga thaw tum ding le thaw dinga nangnia sin thawtu chu Pathien a ni sih a.
14,Do all things without murmurings and questionings:,"Chierna le insêlnahai um loin iengkim thaw ro,"
15,"that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,","suon rilo le kâwmawhai laiah, demkâilo le pawitâwklo, Pathien nau sawisêlbohai in ni theina dingin.Annirawi laia hringna thu in inhlan pha chun, khawvêla hin sukvartu dingin insuklang ro."
16,"holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.","Chuongchun, a thlâwna tlân ka ni nawh a, a thlâwna sininrim ka ni bawk naw leiin Krista nia chun suong ding nei thei ka tih."
17,"Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:","Anih, in ringna inthâwina le rawngbâwlna chunga chun bun- thlâka um ding ni lang khawm ka lâwm a nih, in rêngin ka lâwmpui bawk cheu a nih."
18,"and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.","Chuong ang bawkin nangni khawm lâwm unla, mi lâwmpui ve ro."
19,"But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.","Nisienlakhawm, in chanchin ka hrieta ka lungmuong ve theina dingin sâwt nawtê hnungah Timothe hi in kuoma hung tir Lalpa Isua chun ka beisei a nih."
20,"For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.","Hieng anga lungril put, in um- zie titakzeta ngaituopêktu ding cheu tûkhawm ka nei si nawh a."
21,"For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.","An rêngin Isu Krista thil zawng loin, mâni thil an zawng hlak sih a."
22,"But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child serveth a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.","Nisienlakhawm, ama hi chu fiea a um tâkzie in hriet, nauin a pa rawng a bâwl angin, Chanchin Ṭha sukdar kawngah rawng a mi bâwlpui hlak kha."
23,"Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:","Chuongchun, ka chanchin ding ka hriet phingleh ama hi hung tir nghâl lang ka ti a nih."
24,but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.,"Nisienlakhawm, kei ngei khawm sâwt nawtê hnungah hung Lalpaa chun kân ring tlat a nih."
25,"But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;","Nisienlakhawm, Epaphrodita, ka unaupa, ka sinthawpui, ka sipai- pui le in tirko, ka thil tlâksama mi sawmdâwltu hi in kuoma hung tir ṭulin ka hriet."
26,"since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:","Ama chun in rêngin a ngai bêk bêk cheu a, a nâ ti in lo hriet leiin nasatakin a lungngai bawk a,"
27,"for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.","thi ngama nâ chu a ni ngei luoh a. Nisienlakhawm, Pathienin ama chu a lunginsiet a; chun, ama chau khawm ni loin, lungngaina chunga lungngai nâwkzuolna ka nei nawna dingin kei a mi lunginsiet a ni fâwm bawk a."
28,"I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.","Chuongchun, ama hi in hmu nâwk phaa in lâwm theina ding le, kei ka lungngai a ṭhathnem theina dingin ka hung tir inhmaw deu a nih."
29,Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:,"Chuongchun, ama hi hlimna tinrêngin Lalpaah lo lâwm unla, hieng ang mi hi ngaihlu ro."
30,"because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.","In mi sawmdâwlna tlin bâk chu sunzawmna dingin thi dâwn loa thâtak suoin, Krista sinthawna leiin thi vângin a lo um ta sih a."
