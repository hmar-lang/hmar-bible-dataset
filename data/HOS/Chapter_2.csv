1,"Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.","In naupahai kuoma chun, “Ka mihai” ti unla, in farnuhai kuoma chun, “Lunginsietna dawngtu” ti ro."
2,"Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;","In nu hi ngên ro, ngên ro; Ama hi ka nuhmei a ni si nawh a. Kei khawm a pasal ka ni nawh; A hmêla inthawkin a nawchizawr chîng hi pei thla sienla, A ṭânghai laia inthawkin a uiret chîng hi pei thla raw se."
3,"lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.","Chuong naw chun saruokin siem ka ta, A pieng nia a um angin inumtir ka tih, Thlalêr angin siem ka ta, Ram ṭâwl angin inumtir ka ta, Dangchârin sukhlum ka tih."
4,"Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of whoredom;","A nauhai khawm lainat naw ning, Nawchizawr nauhai an ni sih a."
5,"for their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.","An nu chun nawchi a zawr hlak a, Anni vawntu chu inzâpuiumtakin a um a; Ka bu dâm, ka tui dâm, ka sahmul dâm, Ka pat dâm, ka hriek dâm le, ka dâwn dinghai mi petu. Ka dit zâwnghai chu hnawt ka tih, a ti a nih."
6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.","Chuleiin, ngai ta, i lampui chu hlingin hruk ka ta, Ama dang dingin dai sak ka ta, A lampuihai chu hmu naw nih."
7,"And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.","Chun, a dit zâwnghai chu hnawt a ta, Hnawt phâk naw nih. Anni chu zawng a ta, hmu naw nih; Chuongchun, Ka pasal hmasa kuomah kîr nâwk ka tih. Tulai nêk hin kha hma kha ka ta dingin a ṭha lem si, tîng a tih."
8,"For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.","Bu dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm hi, Tangka ka sukpungpêkhai hi, Rângkachak Baal ta dinga an hmanghai leh; Keima pêk a nih ti a hriet si nawh a;"
9,"Therefore will I take back my grain in the time thereof, and my new wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.","Chuleiin, ka bu chu a hunah, Ka uoin khawm chu a hunah la kîr nâwk ka ta, Ka sahmul le ka pat, a saruok inkhumna ding chu lâkpêk ka tih."
10,"And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.","Chuongchun, a dit zâwnghai mithmua chun, A saruok zâmaw chu suklang ka tih; Ka kuta inthawk chun tu- khawma sansuok naw ni hai."
11,"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.","A hlimna po po, a ruoiṭhe dâm, a thla thar dâm, A châwlni dâm le a hunbi ruoiṭhehai po po khawm suktâwp vawng ka tih."
12,"And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.","A grêp hrui le a theichang kûng, Hieng hi ka dit zâwnghai mi pêk, ka hlaw chu a nih, A ti hlakhai chu sukrêm ka tih. Ramhnuoiah siem ka ta, ramsahaiin fâng an tih."
13,"And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith Jehovah.","Riminhnik a rawpêk hlak Baal nihai chu a chungah thung ka ta, Chuong lai chun a nabehai le a în cheinahai chu ân bel a, A dit zâwnghai a pan a, kei a mi theinghil a nih, Ti hi LALPA thu suok a nih."
14,"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.","Chuleiin, ngai ta, thlêm ka ta, thlalêrah ṭhuoi ka ta, Bau ṭhatakin ama chu bieng ka ta,"
15,"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.","Chu chena inthawk chun a grêp huonhai chu pêng ka ta, Akor ruom khawm beiseina kawtkhâr dingin. Chutaka chun a tleirâwl lai nihai le, Aigupta rama inthawka a hung suok ni ang khan dawn a tih."
16,"And it shall be at that day, saith Jehovah, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali.","Chun, chu nia chun, LALPA chun a tih, Ka pasal mi tîng i ta, Ka Baal mi ti ta naw ti nih;"
17,"For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.",A baua inthawkin Baal hming- hai hi ka sukhmangpêk ding a ni sih a; an hming hi sâm ni ta hrim hrim naw nih.
18,"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.","Chu nia chun ramsahai, chung- lêng vatehai, hnuoia thilhringhai leh an ta dingin thuthlung siem ka ta; thalngulhai, kâwlhnâm dâm le indo nahai hi hnuoia inthawkin sukbo- hmang ka ta, himtakin inum hmun- khattir ka tih."
19,"And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.","Kumkhawtluongin ka ta dingin huol tlat ka ti cheh a, felna dâm, rorêlna dâm, lunginsietna dâm, lai- natna dâmin ka ta dingin huol ka ti che."
20,I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know Jehovah.,"Ringumnain huol ka ti cheh a, chuongchun, LALPA chu hrieng i tih,"
21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith Jehovah, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;","Chu ni chun, LALPA chun a tih, Vânhai bieng ka ta, annin hnuoi bieng an tih;"
22,"and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.","Chun, hnuoi chun bu dâm, uoin dâm, hriek dâm bieng an ta; Chun, anni chun Jezreel bieng an tih."
23,"And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them that were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.","Chun, ama chu ka ta dingin hnuoia hin chîng ka ta, Lo-ruhama chu lainat ka ta, Ka mi nilo chu “Ka mi i nih” tîng ka ta, Chun, ama chun, “Ka Pathien i nih,” tîng a tih."
