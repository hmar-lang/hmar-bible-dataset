1,"Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.","Aw nangni thiempuhai, hi hi lo hre ta u, Nangni Israel sûnghai, lo ngai ta u, Aw laltak sûnghai, na lo sit ta u, Rorêlna chu nangni ta ding a ni sih a; Mizpaa châng le, Tabor tlânga lên zar in ni leiin."
2,And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.,"Mi helhai chun sukhlum hi an uor êm êm a, Kei ruok chu an rênga kâwktu ka nih."
3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled.","Ephraim chu ka hriet a, Israel chu keimaa thup a ni nawh, Tuhin, aw Ephraim, nawchizawr i chîng leiin, Israel chu sukpawrche a na;"
4,"Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah.","An Pathien tienga nghakîr dingin, An thil thaw hlakhai chu an bânsan nawh a; Nawchizawr lungril anni lai a um sih a, LALPA chu an hriet naw a nih."
5,And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.,"Israel sawngtawlawi chun a hmai sanah ân hriettir a, Chuongchun, Ephraim le Israel chu an khawhlonaa chun tlûng an ta; Juda khawm anni lai tlu vêng a tih."
6,They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them.,"An berâm ruolhai le an bâwng ruolhai leh, LALPA zawng dingin fêng an ta; Nisienlakhawm, ama chu hmu nâwng an tih, An kuoma inthawkin ân siekieng tah a nih."
7,They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.,LALPA chungah vervêktakin an thaw a nih; Hnam dang nauhai an nei sih a; Thla thar chun an lohma chen leh bohmangna intlun a tih.
8,"Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin.","Gibea khuoa chun tawtawrâwt mût unla, Rama khuoa chun tawtawrâwt mût ro; Beth-avena chun khêk rak rak unla, Aw Benjamin, i hnung tieng kha!"
9,Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.,"Ephraim chu hremna nia chun sukrêm nîng a ta, Thil hung ni ngei ding chu Israelhai laia chun kân hriettir tah a nih."
10,The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.,"Juda mi lienhai chu ramri sawntuhai an na, An chungah ka lunginsenna chu tui angin bunthlâng ka tih."
11,"Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after man’s command.","Ephraim chu thupêk zâwm a nuom vieu leiin, Nêksâwrin a um a, rorêlna chu suksietin a um a nih."
12,"Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.","Chuleiin, Ephraim ta ding chun hângthim ang ka na, Juda sûngkuohai ta ding chun hmawnna ang ka nih."
13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.","Ephraim chun a natna a hmuh a, Juda chun a hliem a hmuh a, Chuongchun, Ephraim chu Assuria kuomah a feh a, Laltak Jareb kuoma chun mi a tir a; Nisienlakhawm, ama chun a sukdam thei naw cheu a, In hliemna chu a sukdampêk thei bawk naw cheu."
14,"For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.","Ephraim ta ding chun sakeibaknei ang, Juda ta ding chun sakeibaknei vânglai ang ka ni ding a ni sih a; Keima, keima ngeiin keithlêr ka ta, Fêng ka ta, fe hmangpui ka tih; Sansuoktu ding tukhawm um naw ni hai."
15,"I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.","An thiemnawzie an inhriet a, ka hmêl an zawng hma chun, Fêng ka ta, ka hmunah kîr nâwk ka tih; An tuornaa chun mi zawng an ta, hieng hin tîng an tih:"
