1,"The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.","Juda lalhai Uzzia, Jotham, Ahaz le Hezekia inlal lai le Israel lal Jeroboam, Joas naupa inlal laia Beeri naupa Hosea kuoma LALPA thu hung tlung chu."
2,"When Jehovah spake at the first by Hosea, Jehovah said unto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land doth commit great whoredom, departing from Jehovah.","Hosea hmanga LALPA thu hril phutna chu. LALPA chun Hosea kuomah, “Fe la, nawchizawr thla, nawchizawr mi, nuhmeiah va nei rawh, hi ram hin LALPA chu a uiret hmangsan tah,” a tih a."
3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son.","Chuongchun, a feh a, Diblaim naunu Gomer chu a nei tah a; chun, nau a vawn a, naupasal a neipêk a."
4,"And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.","Chun, LALPA chun a kuomah, “A hmingah Jezreel sak rawh; Jezreel thisen phuba chu Jehu sûnghai chungah lâng ka ta; Israel sûnghai ram chu suktâwp ka tih."
5,"And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.","Chun, chu nia chun Jezreel ruomah Israelhai thalngul chu suktliek ka tih,” a ta."
6,"And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And Jehovah said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.","Chun, nau a vawn nâwk a, naunuhmei a nei a. Chun, a kuomah, “A hmingah Lo-ruhama sak rawh; Israel sûnghai chu ka lainat ngai ta naw ding a nih, ka ngaidam vak ta âwm si nawh a."
7,"But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.","Juda sûnghai ruok chu lainat ka ta, thalngul amanih, kâwlhnâm amanih, indona amanih, sakawr amanih, sakawr chung chuong mi amaniha anni sandam loin, LALPA an Pathien chun sandam ka tih,” a ta."
8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.","Chun, Lo-ruhama chu nêne nêk ân bântir a, chun, nau a vawn nâwk a, naupasal a nei a."
9,"And Jehovah said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.","Chun, LALPA chun hieng hin a tih a, “A hmingah Lo-ammi sak rawh, nangni hi ka mihai in ni si nawh a; chun, kei khawm in Pathien ni naw ning,” a ta."
10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.","Nisienlakhawm, Israel nauhai chu tuisuorieta phaiphin, inkhi ruol lo le tiem ruol lo zât nîng an ta; chun, an kuomah, “Ka mihai in ni nawh” tina hmun ngeia chun “Pathien hring nauhai in nih,” ti nîng a tih."
11,"And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.","Chun, Juda nauhai le Israel nauhai chu pung khâwm an ta, an lu ding ruot an ta, chu rama inthawk chun hang fêng an ta, Jezreel ni chu a ropui ding a ni sih a."
