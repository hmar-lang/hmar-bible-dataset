6,"For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.","Israela inthawk chun hi hi a ni sih a, Sinthawtu siem a na, Pathien a ni nawh; Anih, Samaria sebâwngte lim chu suknâwi vawng nîng a tih."
7,"For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.","Thli an chîng a, thli sie an sîk ding a ni sih a, Kûng ngîr a nei nawh a, a zîk khawm chun ra insuo naw ni; Insuo khawm ni sienla, mikhuolhaiin fa zo an tih."

Sa an inhlân a, an fâk a; chuong chu LALPAIN a pawm nawh. Chuongchun, an rîtlona hre zing a ta, an suol hrem a ta, Anni chu Aigupta ramah kîr nâwk an tih."
14,"For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.","Israel chun a siemtu a theinghil a, In ropuihai a bâwl a; Juda chun khawpui kul neihai a sukpung a; Nisienlakhawm, a khawpuihaia chun mei tir ka ta, A in ropuihai chu kâng zo a tih."
