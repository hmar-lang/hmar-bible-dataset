1,"Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast played the harlot, departing from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor.","Aw Israel, lâwm naw ta, Hnam danghai angin hlim so luom naw rawh; I Pathien chu nawchi i zawr san a, Hrizâwl tina chun nawchizawr ruoi man chu i ngaina sih a."

4,"They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah.","LALPA kuomah uoin chu bun suok nâwng an ta, An thilinhlânhai chu a ta dingin lâwmum ni bawk nâwng a tih; An bei chu lusûnhai bu ang nîng a ta, A fa taphawthai chu sukpawrche nîng an tih. An bei chu an hringna ta ding chau nîng a ta, LALPA inah hunglût naw nih."

6,"For, lo, they are gone away from destruction; yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.","Ngai ta u, sietna chu an mâksan a, Aigupta chun anni chu lo kei khâwm lem a tih, Memphis chun lo phûm a tih; An tangkaruo thil ditumhai chu zakthlaiin bâwm a ta, An puon inhaia chun hlo hlingnei um a tih,"
7,"The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.","Hremna nihai chu a hung tlung a, Thungna nihai chu a hung tlung ie! Israel chun chu chu hrieng a ta; I rîtlona chu a tamin intaina a tam leiin. Zâwlnei chu ân vêt a, thlarau nei mi chu mi invêt a nih."
8,"Ephraim was a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his God.","Ephraim râl vêngtu chu ka Pathien kuoma um a na, Zâwlnei hlak chu a lampui intluonin chângkamtu châng kam a um a; A Pathien ina khawm intaina a um."
9,"They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.","Gibea khuoa umlai nihai ang khan, Nasatakin anni le anni an insukkhawhlo a; An rîtlona chu hre zing a ta, An suolnahai chu thung a tih."
10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.","Israel chu thlalêra grêp ra ang elin ka hmuh a, In pahai chu, theichang hun hmasaa a hmin hmasa angin ka hmuh. Nisienlakhawm, anni chu Baalpeor hmunah an hung a. Thil inzakumtaka chun an inpumpêk tah a; An ingainat tak ang bawk chun tirdak an um ve ta a nih."
11,"As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.","Ephraim ropuina chu vate angin vuong hmang a ta, Nau nei dâm, nau vawn dâm, inrai dâm um naw ni hai."
12,"Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!","An nauhai hung sukpuitling hai sien khawm, pasal hrim um lo dingin, Insûntir tho tho ka tih; Anih, anni ka nghatsan pha chun, An chung a va rik zuol âwm de!"
13,"Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer.","Tura ka hmu ang bawkin, Ephraim chu hmun inhawitaka siein a um a, Nisienlakhawm, Ephraim chun a nauhai chu thattu kuomah la ṭhuoi a tih."
14,"Give them, O Jehovah—what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.","Aw LALPA, inneitir rawh. Ieng am inneitir i ta? Sul nau insiet hlak le, nêne vuoihai chu inneitir rawh."
15,All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.,An rîtlona po po chu Gilgal khuoah a um a; Chutaka chun anni chu ka theida sih a.

16,"Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.","Ephraim chu vuokin a um a, an zung chu a vuoi zo tah, Ra insuo naw ni hai; Anih, insuo hai sien khawm, an sul ra ditumtak chu That tho tho ka tih."
17,"My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.","Ka Pathien chun anni chu peihâwn a tih. Ama an ngaisak naw leiin; Chuongchun, hnam danghai lai chun invâiin um an tih."
