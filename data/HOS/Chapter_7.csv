1,"When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without.","Israel sukdam ka tum leh Ephraim khawhlona a hung inlang a. Samaria rîtlona leh, hlêm an chîng a nih. Sûng tieng inru a hung lût a, Tuol tienga chun suomhmang ruolin an suom sih a,"
2,And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.,"An rîtlona po po chu ka hriet zing ti An lungrilin an ngaituo nawh; Tuhin chu an thilthawhai ngeiin a chîm vêl tlat tah a, Ka hmaihma ngeiah an um a nih."
3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.",An rîtlona chun laltak an suklâwm a; An thu khêlin mi lienhai an suklâwm bawk a.
4,"They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.","An rêngin uire an na, Bei siemtuin thuk a ur lum, Beiphit a hmethnâk a tho hmaa, Mei tâwl a châwlsan hri ang hi an nih."
5,On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.,"Ei laltak nia chun mi lienhai chu uoin inruitakin an insukrui a, Ama chun hmusittuhai ruolin a kut a phar a."
6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.","Inrûka an inchân laiin an lungril chu thuk ang elin an siem tah a; An lunginsen chu zânkhawvârin a dei a, Zîngkâr chun meichawk angin a hung chawk a."
7,"They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.","Thuk ang elin an sa vawng a, an rorêltuhai an sukbohmang a; An laltak taphawthai chu an tluh a, Anni lai tukhawm a mi ko an um nawh."
8,"Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.","Ephraim hlak chu hnam danghai lai ân zêlsa a, Ephraim chu bei inlet lo a nih."
9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not.","Mikhuolhai chun a hrâtna an fâk zopêk a, Ama chun chu a hriet nawh; Hmul inṭuokin ama chu a bâwm nuol tah a, Ama chun chu a hriet nawh."
10,"And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this.","Israel chapona chun ama thiemnawzie ân hriettir a, Nisienlakhawm, hieng po poa khawm hin, LALPA an Pathien tieng chu an ngha nawh a, Ama chu an zawng bawk nawh,"
11,"And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.","Ephraim chu vaṭhu inhai, hrietthiemna nei lo ang a lo na, Aigupta tieng an ko vak a, Assuria tienga chun an fe vak a;"
12,"When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.","An fe chu an chungah ka lên hei dêng ka ta, Chunglêng vate man angin man ka tih; An thil suol thaw ang huin anni hrem ka tih."
13,"Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.","An chung a rik ie; ka kuoma inthawkin an fe hmang ta sih a! Bohmangna an chungah a tlung ie, ka chungah an hel ta sih a! Kei chun anni sandam ka nuom a, Anni ruok chun khêl an mi hril khum a,"
14,"And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.","An lungril takin an mi ko nawh a, An khum laizâwlah an chierinthluok mei mei a nih; Bu le uoin dingin an inkhâwm a, ka chunga chun an hel sih a."
15,"Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me.","Kei chun an bânhai chu inchûktirin ka sukhrât a, Nisienlakhawm, ka chungah thil ṭha naw an suongtuo a nih."
16,"They return, but not to him that is on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.","An ngha kîr a, Achunghnungtak kuomah ni loin; Thalngul rul ang an nih, An mi lienhai chu an ṭawng pâwngpawr leiin kâwlhnâmin tlûng an tih; Hi hi Aigupta rama nuizatbûr an nina nîng a tih."
