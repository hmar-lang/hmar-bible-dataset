1,"And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth.","Chun, pindan sûngrila in- thawk chun rawl inringtakin, vântirko pasarihai kuoma chun, “Fe unla, Pathien lunginsenna berbuhai chu hnuoiah bunthla ro,” a ti ka hriet a."
2,"And the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image.","Chun, a hmasatak chu a feh a, a berbu chu hnuoiah a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, Sahrâng inchikna nei- hai le a lim chibai bûkhai chunga chun pânsie natakin ân chang tah a."
3,"And the second poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died, even the things that were in the sea.","Chun, a pahnina chun a berbu chu tuisuorietah a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, mithi thisen angin thi- senin ân chang tah a; chun, thilhring tinrêng tuisuorieta umhai chu an thi ta vawng a."
4,And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood.,"Chun, a pathumna chun a berbu chu vadungahai le tuikhurahai a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, thisenin ân chang tah a."
5,"And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge:","Chun, tui vântirko chun, “Nang Mi Inthieng, hieng anga ro i rêl leiin, nang um zing le um tah, i fel ie."
6,"for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy.","Anni chun mi inthienghai le zâwlneihai thisen an insuoh a; chun, nangin dâwn dinga thisen ma i pêk thung hi dâwn tlâk an ni hrim deh,” a ti ka hriet a."

9,And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.,"Chuongchun, mihai chu lumtaka em ûtin an um a, chuong hremna chunga thuneitu Pathien hming chu an hrilsiet a, ama chawimawi dingin an sim chuong nawh."
10,"And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,","Chun, a pangana chun a berbu chu Sahrâng lalṭhungphaah a bun- thlâk a; chuongchun, a ram chu a hung inthim ta vawng a. Chun, an nat leiin an lei an se a,"
11,and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.,an nahai le an pânnahai leiin vâna Pathien chu an hrilsiet a; an thilthawhai chu an sim chuong nawh.
12,"And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrising.","Chun, a parukna chun a berbu chu tuipui Euphratesa chun a bunthlâk a; chuongchun, nisa suokna tieng panga lal hung dinghai ta dinga lampui chu inzosa a hung ni theina dingin, a tui chu a kang intan tah a."
13,"And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs:","Chun, drakon baua inthawk le Sahrâng baua inthawk le, zâwlnei tehlêm baua inthawk chun thlarau inthiengnaw pathum u ni âwmtak, hung suok ka hmuh a."
14,"for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.","Chuong chu khawhri thlarau, thilmak thaw hlakhai an nih. Anni chu Pathien Iengkimthawthei ni ropuia indonaa ṭhuoi khâwm dingin khawvêl po poa lalhai kuomah an feh a."
15,"(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.)","(Ngai ta, inru angin ka hung ding a nih; inringa a puon dierkei zing chu a hamṭha, chuong naw chun, saruokin lêng a ta, a zamaw hmu rawi an tih)."

18,"and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.","Chun, kâwlinlep dâm, rawl dâm, vâninrûm dâm, a hung um tah a, simkhawleihnuoi khawm nasatak- in ân hnîng a, hnuoia mihriem uma inthawk chuong ang hrima nasa a la um ngai nawh, simkhawleihnuoi inhnîng chuong ang lâwma nasa le ropui chu."
19,"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.","Chuongchun, khaw ropui chu hmun thumah a hung inṭheh a, hnam tin khuohai chu a hung chim a; chun, a lunginsen nasatna uoin no chu a kuoma pêk dingin Babulon khaw ropui chu Pathien hmaa hriet zingin a lo um tah a."
