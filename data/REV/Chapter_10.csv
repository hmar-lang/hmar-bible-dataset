1,"And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire;","Chun, vântirko hrâttak dang pakhat, sûma inthuom, vâna inthawka hung ṭum ka hmuh a; a lua chun sumrisâng ân zâm a, a hmai chu nisa ang a na, a kehai chu mei ban ang a nih."
2,"and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth;","A kuta chun lekhabu chîtê phawk sa a chawi a, a ke changtiengin tui- suoriet a sir a, a vawitiengin khaw- muol a sir a;"
3,"and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.",sakeibaknei inhûk angin rawl inringtakin a khêk tah a. A khêk zo chun vâninrûm pasarihai chun an rawl an insuo tah a.
4,"And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.","Chun, vâninrûm pasarihai chun an rawl an insuo phingleh ziek ka tum a; chuongchun, “Vâninrûm pasarihai thu hril chu ip tlat la ziek naw,” tiin vâna inthawkin rawl ka hriet a."
5,"And the angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven,","Chun, vântirko tuisuoriet le khawmuola ngîr ka ihmu chun a kut chang tieng vân tieng a phar a,"
6,"and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, that there shall be delay no longer:","chatuona hring zing, vân, a chunga thil umhai le hnuoi, a chunga thil umhai le, tuisuoriet, a sûnga thil umhai le siemtu chu sâlin, “Hun um ta naw ni."
7,"but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished the mystery of God, according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.","nisienlakhawm, vântirko pasari- na rawl ri a um phaleh, a mût ding ṭêpin, Pathien thurûk chu kim tâng a tih, a suok zâwlneihai kuoma a chanchin ṭha hril ang khan,” a tih a."
8,"And the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard it again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.","Chun, vâna inthawka rawl ka ihriet khan a mi biek nâwk a, “Tuisuoriet le khawmuola ngîr vân- tirko kuta lekhabu phar sa saw va la rawh,” a ti ka hriet a."
9,"And I went unto the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.","Chun, vântirko kuoma chun ka va feh a, a kuomah, “Lekhabu chîtê kha mi pe rawh,” ka tih a. Ama chun ka kuomah, “La la, fa zo vawng rawh, chuongchun, i phîng chu sukkhâng a ta, i baua ruok chun khuoizu angin thlum a tih,” a ta."
10,"And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.","Chun, vântirko kuta inthawkin lekhabu chîtê chu ka lâk a, ka fâk zo vawng a; chuongchun, ka baua chun khuoizu angin a thlum a; nisien- lakhawm, ka fâk zo phingleh, ka phîng chu a kha zo tah a."
11,"And they say unto me, Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.","Chun, ka kuomah, “Mi tamtak dâm, hnam tamtak dâm, ṭawng tam- tak dâm, lal tamtak dâm chungchâng thu hril nâwk i tih,” an tih a."
