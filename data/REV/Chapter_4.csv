1,"After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, a voice as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter.","Chuong thil hnunga chun ka hang en a, chun, ngai ta, vânah kawtkhâr inhawng ka hmuh a; chun, rawl ka hriet hmasak, tawtawrâwt ri anga mi bie khan, “Hitaka hin hung rawh, chuongchun, tuta hnunga thil hung um dinghai inentir ka ti che,” a ta."
2,"Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne;","Chun, kârloin Thlarauin ka lo um nghâl tah a; chun, ngai ta, vânah lalṭhungpha a lo inṭhut a, chu ṭhungphaa chun mi pakhat a lo ṭhung bawk a."
3,"and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.","Chu a ṭhung chu jaspi le sardion lung ang elin ân lang a; chun, lalṭhungpha vêla chun sumrisâng, ena smaragdin lung ang, ân zâm a."
4,"And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold.","Lalṭhungpha vêla chun lalṭhung- pha sâwmhni le pali a um a; chun lalṭhungphahaia chun upa sâwmhni le pali puon vâr sila ṭhung ka hmu a, rângkachak lallukhumhai an khum a."
5,"And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;","Lalṭhungphaa inthawk chun kâwlinlep dâm, rawl dâm, vâninrûm dâm a hung suok dur dur a. Chun, meiser pasari lalṭhungpha hmaa chun a chawk a, chuong chu Pathien thlarau pasari kha an nih."
6,"and before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.","Chun, lalṭhungpha hmaa chun hlimen tuisuoriet ang, krustal lung ang el a um a; chun, Lalṭhungpha laia le lalṭhungpha vêlah thilhring pali hma tieng le hnung tieng mita sip, an um a."
7,"And the first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.","Thilhring pakhatna chu sakei- baknei ang a na, thilhring pahnina chu sebâwngte ang a na, thilhring pathumna chun mihriem hmêl ang a put a, thilhring palina chu mupui vuong lai ang a nih."
8,"And the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.","Chun, thilhring pali chu thla paruk seng nei, an pumin an sûng tieng chena mita sip an nih. “Lalpa Pathien Iengkimthawthei, Um ta le, um zing le hung um ding chu, Ân thieng ie, ân thieng ie, ân thieng ie,” tiin sûn le zân an châwl ngai nawh."
9,"And when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth for ever and ever,","Chun, thilhringhai chun lal- ṭhungphaa ṭhung chatuona hring zing chu an sukropuia, an chawi- mawia, lâwmthu an hril po leh,"
10,"the four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and shall worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying,","upa sâwmhni le pali hai chu lalṭhungphaa ṭhung hmaa chun an bawkkhup a, chatuona hring zing chu chibai an bûk a, an lallukhumhai chu lalṭhungpha hmaa chun an sieh a,"
11,"Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power: for thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created.","“Nang kan Lalpa le kan Pathien, Ropuina dâm, chawimawina dâm, thilthawtheina dâm chu Hmu tlâk i nih ie, Nangin iengkim i siem a, I dit leia um le siem An ni bawk sih a,” tiin."
