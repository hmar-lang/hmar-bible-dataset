9,"And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:","Chun, inchikna pangana chu a hang sût phingleh, mâichâm hnuoia Pathien thu lei le an pawm inhriettirna thu leia thathai thlarau chu ka hmuh a;"
10,"and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?","anni chun rawl inringtakin, “Aw Lalpa, mi inthieng le indiktak, ieng chen am rorêl loa hnuoia umhai chunga kan thisen insuona phuba chu la loa i um ding?” tiin an khêk a."

12,"And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood;","Chun, inchikna parukna chu a hang sût lai ka en zing a, chun, simkhawleihnuoi nasatakin a hung inhnîng a; chun, nisa chu sahmul saiip puon angin a hung dum a, thla khawm chu a pumin thisen angin a hung um tah a."
