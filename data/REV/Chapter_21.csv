1,And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no more.,"Chun, vân thar le hnuoi thar ka hmuh a; vân hmasa le hnuoi hmasa chu a bohmang tah a, tuisuoriet khawm a um ta naw a nih."
2,"And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.","Chun, khaw inthieng Jerusalem thar chu, mo a pasal ela ân chei angin inzosa hieuin, Pathien kuoma vâna inthawka hung ṭum ka hmu bawk a."
3,"And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God:","Chun, lalṭhungphaa inthawkin rawl inring tak ka hriet a, “Ngai ta, Pathien bâwkte chu mihriem lai a hung um tah, Ama chu an kuomah um a ta, Anni chu a mihai nîng an ta, Pathien ngei chu an kuomah um a ta, An Pathien ni bawk a tih;"
4,"and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away.","An mita inthawkin mitthli po po hrufai a ta; Thina um nâwk ta naw nih a, Lungngai dâm, ṭap dâm, nat dâm khawm, Um nâwk ta bawk naw nih a; Thil hmasahai chu a bo tah,” tiin."
5,"And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true.","Chun, lalṭhungphaa ṭhung chun, “Ngai ta, thil iengkim ka siem thar ie,” a ta. Chun, “Ziek rawh, hieng thu hi ring a umin â n dik sih a,” a ti bawk a."
6,"And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.","Chun, ka kuomah, “A hung tlung tah. Kei Alpha le Omega, a Bul le a Tâwp ka nih; dangchâr taphawt kuoma chun Hringna Tuikhura in- thawkin a thlâwnin pêng ka tih."
7,"He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.","Hnetu taphawt chun chuong chu hluong an tih, kei an Pathien nîng ka ta, anni chu ka nauhai nîng an tih."
8,"But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.","Amiruokchu, mi dawi dâm, awi- naw dâm, tirdakum dâm, tuolthat dâm, indit hmang dâm, dawithiem dâm, milim bie dâm, khêlinhlip po po dâm chan ding chu mei le kâta kâng dîla chun um a tih; chu chu thi hnina chu a nih,” a ta."
9,"And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.","Chun, berbu pasari, hremna nuhnungtak pasaria sip chawi, vântirko pasari laia pakhat chu a hung a; ama chun, “Hung ta, mo, Berâmte nuhmei chu inentir ka ti che,” tiin a mi biek a."
10,"And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,","Chun, ama chun Thlarauin tlâng lientak insângtakah a mifepui a, Jerusalem khaw inthieng chu, Pathien kuoma vâna inthawka hung ṭum a mîn entir a."
11,"having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal:","Pathien ropuina a nei a, a varzie chu lung mantamtak ang, jaspi lung ang el hi a na, krustal lung angin a tle a nih."
12,"having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:","Kul nasatak insângtak a nei a, kawtkhâr sâwm le pahni a nei a, kawtkhâr bulahai chun vântirko sâwm le pahni an um a, chuong kawt- khâra chun hming ziek a um bawk a, chuong chu Israel thlahai hnam sâwm le pahnihai hming chu a nih;"
13,on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.,"saktieng pangah kawtkhâr pa- thum, hmârtieng pangah kawtkhâr pathum, simtieng pangah kawtkhâr pathum, thlangtieng pangah kawt- khâr pathum a um a."
14,"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.","Chun, chu khaw kul chun lung- phûm sâwm le pahni a nei a, chuonga chun Berâmte tirko sâwm le pahnihai hming a chuong a."
15,"And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.","Chun, a mi betu chun, khuo le kawtkhârhai le a kul chu inkhina dingin rângkachak luong a chawi a."
16,"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal.","Khuo chu inbiel vêlin a um a, a dungtieng chu a khangtieng chen a nih; khuo chu luong chun ân khih a, fîng sîng khat le sâng hni a nih. A dungtieng le a khangtieng le ân sângtieng chu ân ang a nih."
17,"And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.","Chun, a kul chu ân khi nâwk a, mihriem inkhi dân pangngaiin (chu chu vântirko inkhi dân pângngai chu a nih) tawng za khat sâwmli pali a nih."
18,"And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass.","Chun, a kul chu jaspi lunga siem a nih, khuo chu hlimen inthieng ang ela, rângkachak inthienga siem a nih."
19,"The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;","Chu khaw kul lungphûmhai chu lung mantam chi tinrênga chei- mawi a nih. Lungphûm hmasatak chu jaspi lung a na; a pahnina chu sapphir lung a na, a pathumna chu kalkidon lung a na; a palina chu smaragdin lung a na,"
20,"the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.","a pangana chu sardonuk lung a na, a parukna chu sardion lung a na, a pasarina chu kruso lung a na; a parietna chu birul lung a na, a pakuona chu topaz lung a na; a sâwm- na chu krusopra lung a na; a sâwm- pakhatna chu ngên lung a na; a sâwm- pahnina chu amethusto lung a nih."
21,"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.","Chun, kawtkhâr sâwm le pahni chu tuikeplung sâwm le pahni a nih a, kawtkhâr po po chu tuikeplung pa- khat senga siem a nih; chun, chu khaw kawtthlêr chu rângkachak inthieng a nih, hlimen entlang thei ang el hi."
22,"And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof.","Chun, a sûnga chun biekin hrim ka hmu nawh a; Lalpa Pathien Iengkimthawthei le Berâmte chu an biekin an ni sih a."
23,"And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb.","Chu khuo chun a ên dingin nisa a ngai nawh a, thla khawm a ngai bawk nawh; Pathien ropuina chun a ên a, an khâwnvar chu Berâmte a ni sih a."
24,And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.,"A vara chun hnam tin um an ta, hnuoia lalhai chun an ropuina la lût an tih."
25,And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there):,"A kawthai chu sûnah khâr naw tawp an ta, chutaka chun zân hrim a um naw ding a ni sih a."
26,and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it:,A sûnga chun hnam tin ropuina le chawimawina la lût an tih.
27,"and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they that are written in the Lamb’s book of life.","Nisienlakhawm, thil inthieng- naw hrim lût dêr naw nih a, thil tirdakum thawhai le khêlinhlip khawm lût naw bawk an tih; Berâmte Hringna Bua hming an ziekhai chau lût an tih."
