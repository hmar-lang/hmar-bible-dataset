1,"And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.","Chun, ka hang en a, Berâmte chu Zion Tlânga ngîrin le an chala a hming le a Pa hming ziek, mi nuoi khat le sîng li le sâng li a kuoma chun an um a."
2,"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps:","Chun, vâna inthawka rawl ri, tui tamtak ri ang le, vâninrûm ri nasatak ri ang, ka hriet a; chun, ka ri hriet chu ṭingṭang keituhaiin an ṭingṭang an kei ri ang a na,"
3,"and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth.","lalṭhungpha hmaa le, thilhring pali le upahai hmaa chun hla thar ni âwmtak hi an sak a; chun, hnuoia inthawka intlan tah, mi nuoi khat le sîng li le sâng li chau naw khan chu, tûkhawmin chu hla chu an inchûk thei nawh."
4,"These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, to be the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.",Chuonghai chu nuhmeia insuk- thiengnaw nawhai chu an nih; nunghâk inthieng ang an ni sih a. Chuong chu Berâmte a fena taphawta zuituhai chu an nih. Chuong chu Berâmte le Pathien ta dinga ra hma- satak ni dinga mihriem laia inthawka intlan suok an nih.
5,And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.,"An baua khêl a suok hrim miin an hriet ngai nawh, sawisêlbo an ni sih a."
6,"And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;","Chun, hnuoia umhai kuoma le, hnam tinrêng dâm, chi tinrêng dâm, ṭawng tinrêng dâm kuoma tlângin- sampui dinga chatuon Chanchin Ṭha nei vântirko dang vânlaizâwla vuong ka hmuh a;"
7,"and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.","Ama chun rawl inringtakin, “A rorêl hun chu a hung tlung ta leiin Pathien chu ṭi unla, chawimawi ro; vân dâm, hnuoi dâm, tuisuoriet dâm, tui hnâr dâm siemtu chu chibai bûk ro,” a tih a."
8,"And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.","Chun, vântirko dang, a pahnina chun, “Babulon khaw ropui, a mi dit chîngna leia lunginsenna uoiin hnam po po indâwntirtu chu, a tlâwm tah!” tiin a hung zui a."
9,"And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,","Chun, vântirko dang, a pathum- na chun rawl inringtakin, “Tû- khawmin Sahrâng le a lim chibai bûkin a chala manih, a kuta manih inchikna a nei chun, chu mi ngei chun Pathien lunginsenna uoiin,"
10,"he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:","a lunginsenna noa iengkhawm pawl loa siem chu dâwn a ta, vântirko inthienghai mithmua le Berâmte mithmua chun mei le kâta sawisakin um bawk a tih."
11,"and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.","Chun, chuong mihai sawisakna meikhu chu chatuonin hang fêng a ta; Sahrâng le a lim chibai bûktuhai, a hming inchikna nei taphawthai khawm chun, a sûn a zânin châwl hrim nei naw ni hai,” tiin anni chu a hung zui a."
12,"Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.",Hitaka hin mi inthieng Pathien thupêkhai le Isu ringna thu zâwm- tuhai selna inlang theina a um.
13,"And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.","Chun, vâna inthawkin rawlin, “Hienghin ziek rawh: Tuta hnung chu mithi, Lalpaa thihai chu, an hamṭha. Thlarau chun, ‘Anih, an sinin- rimnahai chu châwl san tâng an tih; an thilthawhai chun a hung zui ve ding a ni sih a,’ a tih,” a ti ka hriet a."
14,"And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.","Chun, ka hang en a, sûm vâr tak ka hmuh a. Sûm chunga chun mihriem naupa ang tak hi, rângka- chak lallukhum khuma, kâwite ngei- tak chawia ṭhung ka hmu bawk a."
15,"And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.","Chun, vântirko dang, Pathien biekina inthawkin a hung suok a, sûm chunga ṭhung kuoma chun rawl inringtakin, “I kâwite kha keidawk la, ât rawh; ât a hun ta sih a; hnuoi bu khu a ngui zo tah khu,” a ta."
16,And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.,"Chuongchun, sûm chunga ṭhung chun a kâwite chu hnuoiah a thlâk a, hnuoi bu chu an ât tah a."
17,"And another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.","Chun, vântirko dang vâna Pathien biekina inthawkin a hung suok nâwk a, ama khawm chun kâwite ngeitak a chawi bawk a."
18,"And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.","Chun, vântirko dang, mei chunga thuneitu chu, mâichâma inthawkin a hung suok nâwk a; chun, ama chun rawl inringtakin, “I kâwite ngeitak kha keidawk la, hnuoia grêp hrui ra bâwrhai khu zu ât rawh, grêp rahai khu a hmin ṭuo ta khu,” tiin kâwite ngeitak chawitu chu a ko a."
19,"And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great winepress, of the wrath of God.","Chuongchun, vântirko chun a kâwite chu hnuoiah a thlâk a, hnuoia grêp ra chu a ât a, grêp sâwrna khur lientak, Pathien lunginsenna grêp sâwrna khura chun a the lût a."
20,"And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.","Chun, khaw puo tienga grêp sâwrna khura chun a sir sâwr a, chuongchun, grêp sâwrna khura inthawk chun thisen a hung suok a, fîng sîng khat le za ruk chen sakawr- hai thîrbar chena inthûk a nih."
