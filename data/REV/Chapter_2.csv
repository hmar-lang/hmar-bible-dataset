2,"I know thy works, and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try them that call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false;","I thilthawzie dâm, i sininrimzie dâm, i selzie dâm, mi suolhai i ngaitheinawzie dâm ka hriet. Tirko ni si loa tirko intihai chu I fie bawk a, khêlhlip an nih ti i lo hriet tah a."

7,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.","Thlarauin kohranhai kuoma thu a hril hi na nei chun hre raw se. A hnetu taphawt chu Pathien Paradisa Hringna Thinga chu infâktir ka tih,’ tiin."
8,"And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived again:","“Chun, Smurnaa kohran tirko kuoma chun hieng hin ziek rawh:— “ ‘Hmasatak le Nuhnungtak, thia hung hring nâwk ta khan, hieng thu hi a hril a nih:"
9,"I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty (but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.","I rinumzie dâm, i pasietzie dâm, (nisienlakhawm i hausa si), Juda tak ni loa, Setan inkhâwmna inhai ni lem sih a, Juda intihai i hrilsiet zie dâm ka hriet."
10,"Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer: behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.","I tuor dinghai hi ṭi naw; ngai ta, fiea i um theina dingin, Diebol chun nangni laia mi ṭhenkhat intângna inah a khum ding cheu a nih; chun, ni sâwm rinum tuor in tih.

13,"I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s throne is; and thou holdest fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwelleth.","I umna Setan ṭhungpha umna kha ka hriet; chun, ka hming i kawl tlat a, ka thu hretu Antipa, Setan umnaa nangni laia an ithat, ka mi ringumtak um lai ngei khawm khan i mi ringna hi în phat san naw bawk a."
14,"But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.","Nisienlakhawm, tlâwmtêin demna che ka nei, khataka Balaam inchûktirna thu pawm tuhai amanih in umpui lei khan, ama chun milim biekna sa an fâkna ding le, an inditna dingin Balak chu Israel thlahai hmaah tlûkna sie ân chûktir kha."
15,So hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.,Nang khawmin Nikolahai in- chûktirna thu chuong ang bawka pawm tuhai amanih i umpui bawk a nih.
16,"Repent therefore; or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.","Chuongchun, sim rawh, chuong naw chun i kuomah hung vak ka ta, ka baua kâwlhnâm chun anni hung do ka tih."

18,"And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass:","“Chun, Thuatiraa kohran tirko kuoma chun hieng hin ziek rawh:— “ ‘Pathien Naupa, mit meichawk ang nei, a kephahai dâr tle mi ang khan, hieng thu hi a hril a nih:"
19,"I know thy works, and thy love and faith and ministry and patience, and that thy last works are more than the first.","I thilthawzie dâm, i hmangaizie dâm, i awizie dâm, i rawngbâwlzie dâm, i selzie dâm ka hriet, i thilthaw nuhnungtakhai chu a tîr nêk khan a nasa lem ti ka hriet bawk."
20,"But I have this against thee, that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess; and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.","Nisienlakhawm, demna che ka nei; nuhmei, Jezebel, Zâwlneinu inti kha, i ngai thei leiin; ama chun ka suokhai chu indit le milim biekna thil fâk inchûktirin, a ṭhuoi hmang bawk hlak a nih."
21,And I gave her time that she should repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication.,"Simna dingin a kuomah hun bi ka tuk a, nisienlakhawm, mi dit a chîng chu a sim nuom nawh."
22,"Behold, I cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works.","Ngai ta, ama chu khumah ka pei ding a nih, a rêtpuituhai khawm chu, a thil thaw chînghai chu an sim san naw chun, rinum nasatakah pei bawk ka tih."
23,And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.,"A nauhai chu hriin sukhlum ka ta; chuongchun, kei lungril le lungvar entu ka ni ti kohranhai po po chun hrieng an tih; chun in thaw ang peiin pe seng ka ti cheu."
24,"But to you I say, to the rest that are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who know not the deep things of Satan, as they are wont to say; I cast upon you none other burden.","Nisienlakhawm, nangni Thua- tiraa mi dang um, chu inchûktirna thu pawm loa, Setan thil inthûk an itihai hre naw taphawt kuoma chun, phurrik dang hrim bel naw ning cheu ka ti a nih."

26,"And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations:",A hnetu taphawt le a tâwp chena ka thilthawhai pawmtu chu hnam tin chungah thu inneitir ka tih;
27,"and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have received of my Father:","chun, ama chun bêlhemtu bêl- hai kawinawi dapa a um angin thîr hmawlin ro rêlpêk a tih,"
28,and I will give him the morning star.,"keiin ka Paa inthawka thuneina ka hmu ang bawk hin. Chun, Sikhawvar chu ama pêng ka tih."
29,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.","Thlarauin kohranhai kuoma thu a hril hi na nei chun hre raw se, a tih, tiin."
