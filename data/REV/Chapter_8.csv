1,"And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.","Inchikna pasarina chu a hang sût phingleh, dâr chenve lai vân chu a dei ṭhuop a."
2,And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets.,"Chun, vântirko pasari Pathien hmaa ngîr hlakhai chu ka hmuh a; an kuomah tawtawrâwt pasari an pêk a."
3,"And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.","Chun, vântirko dang a hung a, rângkachak riminhnik rawna bâwm chawiin mâichâm kâwla chun a ngîr tah a; lalṭhungpha hmaa rângkachak mâichâm chunga mi inthienghai po po ṭawngṭainahai belsana dingin, riminhnik tamtak a kuomah an pêk a."
4,"And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.","Riminhnik raw khu chu vântirko kuta inthawk chun Pathien hmaah a hang fe tah a, mi inthienghai ṭawng- ṭainahai le chun."
5,"And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.","Chun, vântirko chun riminhnik rawna bâwm chu a lâk a, mâichâma meiin a suksip a, hnuoiah a peithlâk tah a; chuongchun, vâninrûm dâm, rawl dâm, kâwlinlep dâm, simkhaw- leihnuoi inhnîng dâm, a hung um ve nghâl tah a."
6,And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.,"Chun, vântirko pasari tawtaw- râwt pasari chawihai chu mût dingin an inbuotsai tah a."
7,"And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.","A hmasatak chun a hang mût a, riel le mei, thisen le inpawl, a hung um nghâl a, chu chu hnuoia pei thlâkin a um tah a; hnuoi hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat a kâng hmang a, thinghai khawm hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat a kâng hmang a, hlohna hring po po khawm a kâng hmang ta bawk a."
8,"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;","Vântirko pahnina chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, tlâng lientak meia kâng lai ang tuisuorietah an pei thlâk a."
9,"and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, even they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.","Chuongchun, tuisuoriet hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu thisenin a hung inchang tah a. Tuisuorieta thilsiem, hringna neihai chu, hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu an thi ta bawk a, lawnghai khawm hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu suksiet a ni ta bawk a."
10,"And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters;","Vântirko pathumna chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, arasi lien- tak, meiser anga chawk, vâna in- thawkin a hung tlah a, vadung hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat le tuikhurhai chu a del tah a."
11,"and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.","Chu arasi hming chu Sairam a nih. Tui hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu sairamah a hung inchang tah a; chuongchun, chu tui chu an dâwn a, mi tamtak an thih a, a hung khâk tâk leiin."
12,"And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.","Vântirko palina chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, nisa hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat, thla hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat, arasihai khawm hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu suksiet a ni tah a; chuonghai hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu ân thimna ding le, sûn chu hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat a var nawna dingin, zân khawm chuong ang bawkin a nih."
13,"And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound.","Chun, ka hang en a, mupui vân- laizâwla vuongin, rawl inringtakin, “Vantirko pathum tawtawrâwt la mût ding, chu ri la hung um dinghai lei chun hnuoia umhai chung a rik ie, a rik ie, a rik ie!” a ti ka hriet a."
