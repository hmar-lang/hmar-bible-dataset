2,"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God.","Chun, hlimen mei le inpawl tuisuoriet ni âwmtak ka hmuh a; Sahrâng dâm, a lim dâm, a hming nambar dâm hnea hung suokhai chu Pathien ṭingṭang chawia, hlimen tuisuoriet panga ngîr ka hmu bawk a."
3,"And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.","Chun, Pathien suok Mosie le Berâmte hla an sak a, “Aw Lalpa Pathien Iengkimthawthei, I thilthawhai chu a ropuiin a mak a; Nang, hnam tin Laltak, I lampuihai chu a felin ân dik a nih."
4,"Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.","Aw Lalpa, tu am i hming inza nawh a, Chawimawi naw ding? Nang chau în thieng si; I thilthaw felhai chu suklang a ni ta leiin, Hnam tinrêngin chibai hung bûk an ti che,” tiin."
5,"And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:","Chuong hnunga chun ka hang en a, chun, vâna inhriettirna biekbûk pindan sûngril chu ân hawng a;"
6,"and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with precious stone, pure and bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles.","chuongchun, pindan sûngrila inthawk chun hremna pasari chawi vântirko pasarihai chu, puon in- thieng vârtak silin, an âwm rang- kachak kâwngkhia inkhitin an hung suok a."
7,"And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.","Chun, thilhring pali laia pakhat chun vântirko pasarihai kuoma chun, Pathien chatuona hring zing lungin- sennaa sip rângkachak berbu pasari a pêk a."
8,"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.","Chun, pindan sûngril chu Pathien ropuina le a thilthawtheina khuin a sip tah a; vântirko pasarihai hremna pasari chu a bo hmakhat pindan sûngrila chun tûkhawm an lût thei nawh."
