1,"And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters;","Chun, vântirko pasari berbu pasari chawihai laia pakhat chun a mi biek a. “Hung ta, tui tamtaka ṭhung, nawchizawr ropuitak hremna chu inentir ka ti che."
2,"with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.","Hnuoia lalhai chun ama chu an dit hlak a, hnuoia umhai khawm chu a mi dit chîngna uoin chun vai ruiin an um hlak,” a ta."
3,"And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.","Chuongchun, ama chun Thla- rauin thlalêrah a mi fepui a; chun, Pathien hrilsietna hminga sip, lu sari le ki sâwm nei, sahrâng seninlâr chunga chuong nuhmei ka hmuh a."
4,"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication,","Chu nuhmei chun puon sen duk le sen lâr a sil a, rângkachak le lungmantam le tuikeplungin ân chei a. Rângkachak no, thil tirdakum, a mi dit chîngna thil inthiengnawa sip a chawi a."
5,"and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.","A bâwka chun thurûk, “BABU- LON KHAW ROPUI, HNUOIA NAW- CHIZAWRHAI LE THIL TIRDAK- UMHAI NU,” tia hming ziek a um a."
6,"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder.","Chun, chu nuhmei chu mi inthienghai thisen le Isu martarhai thisena inruiin ka hmuh a. Ka hmu phingleh mak ka ti bêk bêk a."
7,"And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.","Chuongchun, vântirko chun ka kuomah, “Ieng leiin am mak i tih a? Nuhmei le a phurtu sahrâng lu sari le ki sâwm nei thurûk hril ka ti che."
8,"The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, they whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come.","Sahrâng i hmu kha a um ta zet a, a um nâwk ta nawh a; chun, vânsama inthawkin hung suok a ta, bo- hmangnaah fêng a tih. Chun, hnuoia umhai, leihnuoi insieng tîra Hringna Bua hming ziek nawhai chun, sahrâng chu an hmu phâleh, a um ta zeta, a um nâwk ta nawh a, a hung nâwk ding chu mak la tîng an tih."
9,"Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth:",Hitaka hin lungril varna nei inlang theina a um. Lu sarihai chu nuhmei ṭhungna tlâng pasarihai chu an nih. Lal pasari khawm an na;
10,"and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while.","pangahai chu an tlâwm tah a, pakhat chu a la um, pakhat chu a la hung um hri nawh a; a hung um pha chun sâwtnawtê um ding a nih."
11,"And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition.","Chun, sahrâng um ta zeta, um nâwk ta naw ngei khawm kha a parietna a na, pasarihai laia mi kha a ni nghe nghe a; bohmangnaah fêng a tih."
12,"And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.","“Chun, ki sâwm i hmuhai kha lal sâwm ram la nei nawhai an nih; dârkâr khat sûng chu sahrâng leh lalhai angin thuneina la hmûng an tih."
13,"These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast.","Chuongchun, thu hmunkhatin an thilthawtheina le thuneina chu sahrâng pêng an tih."
14,"These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they also shall overcome that are with him, called and chosen and faithful.","Chuongchun, Berâmte chu do an ta, chun, Berâmte chu hotuhai Hotu le lalhai Lal a ni leiin anni chu hnêng a tih; chun, a kuoma um, ko- hai, thlanghai, ringumhai chun hne bawk an tih,” a tih a."
15,"And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.","Chun, ama bawk chun ka kuomah, “Nawchizawr ṭhungna tui i hmuhai kha, mi dâm, mipui dâm, hnam dâm, ṭawng dâm a nih."
16,"And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire.","Chun, ki sâwm i hmu le sahrâng chun nawchizawr chu theidâng an ta, iengkhawm neinaw le saruokin siem an tih, a sa khawm fâng an ta, meiin rawhmang an tih."
17,"For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.","Pathien thuhai chu a tlung hmakhat chun a dit zâwng an thawna ding le thu thuhmuna an um theina dingin le, an ram chu sahrâng kuoma an pêkna dingin Pathienin an lung- rilah a tir ta sih a."
18,"And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.","Chun, i nuhmei hmu kha, khaw ropui, hnuoia lalhai chunga rorêltu chu a nih,” a ta."
