1,"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree.","Chu hnunga chun khawmuola le tuisuorieta le, thing hrim hrima chun thli hrim a hrâng nawna dingin, hnuoi thli pali chu chelin hnuoi kil lia ngîr vântirko pali ka hmuh a."
2,"And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,","Chun, vântirko dang, Pathien hring inchikna chawi, nisa suoknaa hang fe ka hmu bawk a; chun, ama chun vântirko pali, khawmuol le tuisuoriet suksiet theina pêka umhai kuoma chun, rawl inringtakin,"
3,"saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.","“Ei Pathien suokhai chu an chala kan inchik hmakhat chu khawmuol le tuisuoriet le, thinghai chu sukse hri naw ro,” tiin a khêk a."
4,"And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:","Chun, an inchik zât chu ka lo hriet a, Israel thlahai hnam tina mi nuoi khat le sîng li le sâng li an inchik tah a nih."
5,Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;,"Juda hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Reuben hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Gad hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni,"
6,Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand;,"Aser hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Naphtali hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Manasse hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni,"
7,Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;,"Simeon hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Levi hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni, Issakar hnama mi sîng khat le sâng hni,"

9,"After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands;","Chu hnunga chun ka hang en a, chun, ngai ta, mipui nasatak tû- khawm itiem sêng naw, hnam tin laia mi dâm, chi tin laia mi dâm, mi tin laia mi dâm, ṭawng tin laia mi dâm puon vâr sila, tûm kâu chawiin, lalṭhungpha hma le Berâmte hmaa ngîr ka hmuh a;"
10,"and they cry with a great voice, saying, Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.","chuonghai chun rawl inring- takin, “Ei Pathien lalṭhungphaa ṭhung kuoma le, Berâmte kuomah sandamna,” tiin an khêk a."
11,"And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and about the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,","Chun, vântirko po pohai chu lalṭhungpha le upahai le thilhring palihai vêla chun ngîrin an um a; chun, lalṭhungpha hmaa chun bawk- khupin."
12,"saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.","“Amen, malsâwmna dâm, ropuina dâm, varna dâm, Lâwmthu hrilna dâm, chawimawina dâm, Thilthawtheina dâm, hrâtna dâm, Chatuonin ei Pathien kuomah um raw se, Amen” tiin Pathien chibai an bûk a."
13,"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are arrayed in the white robes, who are they, and whence came they?","Chun, upahai laia pakhat chun, ka kuomah, “Hieng puon vâr silhai hi tuhai am an na, khâwtaka inthawka hung am an ni a?” tiin a mi biek a."
14,"And I say unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they that come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.","Kei chun a kuomah, “Pu, nangin i hriet annâwm,” ka ta. Ama chun ka kuomah, “Hieng hi rinum nasataka inthawka suokhai kha an nih, an puonhai Berâmte thisena sâwpin an sukvâr tah a."
15,Therefore are they before the throne of God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them.,"Chuleiin, Pathien ṭhungpha hmaah an um a nih, chun, a sûn a zânin a biekina chun a rawng an bâwl hlak a; lalṭhungphaa ṭhung chun an chungah puon in chu zâr a tih."
16,"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat:","An phîng ṭâm ta naw nih a, dangchâr ta bawk naw ni hai; nisain em naw nih a, lum hrim hrim khawm- in sukrinum ta bawk naw nih."
17,"for the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.","Berâmte, lalṭhungpha laia um chu an vêngtu nîng a ta, hringna tuikhurahai ṭhuoi a tih; chun, Pathienin an mita inthawk mitthli po po hrufai tâng a tih,” a ta."
