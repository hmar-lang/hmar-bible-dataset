1,"and he stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.","Chun, Sahrâng ki sâwm le lu sari nei, tuisuorieta hung suok ka hmuh a, a kihaia chun lallukhum sâwm a uma, a luhaia chun Pathien hrilsietna hminghai a um bawk a."
2,"And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.","Chun, ka Sahrâng hmu chu keitê ang a na, a kehai chu savawm ke ang a nih; a bau chu sakeibaknei bau ang a nih; chun, drakon chun a kuomah a thilthawtheina le a lalṭhungpha le thuneina nasatak a pêk a."
3,And I saw one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast;,"A lu pakhat chu thipui khawp raua hliem angin ka hmuh a, nisien- lakhawm, thipui khawp rau dinga hliem chu a dam tah a; chuongchun, hnuoia mi po poin Sahrâng chu mak an tih a, an zui a."
4,"and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? and who is able to war with him?","Chun, Sahrâng kuoma chun a thuneina chu a pêk leiin drakon chu Pathien chibai bûkin an bûk a; chun, “Sahrâng ang hi tu am a uma, tuin am do thei a ta?” tiin Sahrâng khawm chu an bûk bawk a."
5,and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months.,"Chun, uongna le Pathien hril- sietna thu hrilna bau a kuoma pêk a na, thla sâwmli pahni châng dingin thuneina pêk a ni bawk a."
6,"And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, even them that dwell in the heaven.","Chuongchun, Pathien hrilsein a bau a ka tah a, a hming le a umna, vâna umhai chu hrilse dingin."
7,"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.","Chun, mi inthienghai a do le a hne phal a na, chi tinrêng dâm, mi tinrêng dâm, ṭawng tinrêng dâm, hnam tinrêng dâm chunga thuneina a kuoma pêk a ni bawk a."
8,"And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, every one whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain.","Chuongchun, hnuoia um po po, leilung insieng tîra that tah Berâmtê Hringna Bua hming ziek naw po chun, Pathien chibai bûkin bûk an tih."
9,"If any man hath an ear, let him hear.",Tûkhawmin na a nei chun hre raw se.
10,"If any man is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.","Tûkhawm sala um ding ani chun salah a um hlak, tûkhawmin kâwlhnâma mi a that chun kâwl- hnâma that ding a nih. Hitaka hin mi inthienghai selna le ringna inlang theina a um."
11,"And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.","Chun, Sahrâng dang hnuoia hung suok ka hmuh a; berâmte kî ang ki pahni a nei a, drakon ṭawng angin a ṭawng a."
12,"And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed.","Sahrâng hmasa thuneina po po ang kha a mithmuah a hmang a, Hnuoi le a chunga um po pohai chu Sahrâng hmasa lem, thipui khawp rau dinga hliem dam nâwk chu, chibai ân bûktir bawk a."
13,"And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men.","Chun, mihriem mithmuah vâna inthawka hnuoia mei intlâktir thei khawp rauin thilmak ropuitak a thaw hlak."
14,"And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived.","Hnuoia umhai kuomah, Sa- hrâng kâwlhnâma hliem hnung la dam chawimawina dingin ama lim an siem ding a ni ti hrilin, Sahrâng mithmua thilmak thaw dinga thu a ihmu, chuong thilmak lei chun hnuoia umhai chu a hlêm bawk a."
15,"And it was given unto him to give breath to it, even to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.","Chun, Sahrâng lim chu a ṭawng theina ding le, Sahrâng lim chibai bûk naw taphawt ân sukhlumtir theina dingin Sahrâng lim kuoma chun inthuokna pêk phal a nih."
16,"And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead;","Chun, mi po po a lien a chînin, a hausa a pasiein, suok le suok nawhai khawm, an kut chang tienga manih, an chala manih inchikna ân neitir tâwl a;"
17,"and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, even the name of the beast or the number of his name.","inchikna, Sahrâng hming ama- nih, a hming nambar amanih, neihai chau naw chun, tûkhawmin ieng- khawm an inchâwkin an zawr thei nawna dingin."
18,"Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.",Hitaka hin varna inlang theina a um. Hriet theina nei chun Sahrâng nambar chu sût raw se; mihriem nambar a ni sih a; a nambar chu za ruk sâwmruk paruk a nih.
