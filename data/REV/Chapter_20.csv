1,"And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.","Chun, vântirko vânsam chabi le khaidiet lientak chawia, vâna inthawka hung ṭum ka hmuh a."
2,"And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,","Drakon, rûlpui tar chu (chu chu Diebol le Setan a nih) a man a, kum sâng khata dingin a khuop a,"
3,"and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed for a little time.","vânsama chun a pei lût a, a khâr khum a, kum sâng khat chu ân vawi hmakhat chu hnam tin a hlêm nâwk ta nawna dingin a châr nel tah a; chu hnunga chun sâwtnawtêa dingin insuo nâwk ding a nih."
4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.","Chun, lalṭhungphahai ka hmuh a, a chungah mi an ṭhung a, an kuoma chun rorêlna an pêk a. Chun, Isu inhriettirna thu lei le, Pathien thu leia lu tanhai thlarau le sahrâng le a lim chibai bûk loa, an bâwka manih, an kuta manih inchikna nei nawhai thlarau chu ka hmu bawk a. Chuonghai chu an hung hring a, kum sâng khat sûnga dingin Krista leh rorêlin an um a."
5,The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection.,(Mithi danghai ruok chu kum sâng khat chu ân vawi hmakhat chu an la hring hri nawh a.) Chu chu thonâwkna hmasa chu a nih.
6,"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.","Thonâwkna hmasaa ṭhanghai chu an hamṭhain an inthieng a nih; chuonghai chunga chun thi hnina chun thu hrim a nei nawh a. Pathien le Krista thiempuhai nîng an ta, ama leh kum sâng khat rorêlin um lem an tih."
7,"And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,","Chun, kum sâng khat chu ân vawi pha chun Setan chu ân tângnaa inthawka insuoin um a ta,"
8,"and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.","hnuoi kil lia hnamhai, Gog le Magog chu, hlêma, indonaa ṭhuoi khâwm dingin fe suok a tih; chuong- hai tamzie chu tuisuorieta phaiphin ang el an nih."
9,"And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them.","Chun, hnuoi khang tieng dâpin a tungin an fe a, mi inthienghai le khuo ditumtak chu an inhuol tah a, chun, vâna inthawkin mei a hung tlah a, anni chu a kânghmang tah a."
10,"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.","Chun, anni hlêmtu, Diebol chu Sahrâng le zâwlnei tehlêm umna, mei le kât dîla chun an pei tah a; chuongchun, chatuonin a sûn a zâna sawisakin um an tih."
11,"And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.","Chun, lalṭhungpha lientak vâr- tak le a chunga ṭhung chu ka hmuh a, a hmaa inthawk chun hnuoi le vân an tlân hmang a, an ta dingin hmun hrim a um ta nawh a."
12,"And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.","Chun, mithihai a lien a chîn, lalṭhungpha hmaa ngîr ka hmuh a. Chun, mithihai chu lekhabuhaia ziek an thilthaw ang peiin rêlpêkin an um tah a."
13,And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.,"Tuisuoriet chun a sûnga mithi umhai chu ân suoktir a, Thina le Mithi Khuo chun an sûnga mithi umhai chu an insuoktir bawk a; chun, mi tin an thilthaw ang peia rêlpêkin an um tah a."
14,"And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, even the lake of fire.","Chun, Thina le Mithi Khuohai chu mei dîlah an pei a. Chu chu thi hnina chu a nih–mei dîl chu."
15,"And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.",Tûkhawm Hringna Buah a hming ziek an hmu naw chun mei dilah an pei bawk a.
