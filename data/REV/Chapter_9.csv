1,"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.","Chun, vântirko pangana chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, arasi, vâna inthawka hnuoia tla sa ka hmuh a; chun, vânsam khur chabi chu a kuomah an pêk a,"
2,"And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.","Ama chun vânsam khur chu a hawng a; chuongchun, khura in- thawk chun mei khu, rawtuina mei khu nasatak khu ang, a hung suok a; chun, khura mei lei chun nisa le boruok chu a hung inthim tah a."
3,"And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.","Mei khua inthawk chun khâuhai hnuoi chungah an hung suok a, hnuoia ainuvêthaiin thilthawtheina an nei ang hin, an kuomah thil- thawtheina an pêk a."
4,"And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads.","An chala Pathien inchikna nei naw mihriemhai chau naw chu, hnuoia hlohna dâm, thilhring hrim hrim dâm, thing hrim hrim dâm khawm suksiet naw ding ti an hril a."
5,"And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man.","Chun, an kuoma chun mi- hriemhai chu sukhlum êm loa, thla nga sukrinum lem dingin thu an pêk a; an sukrinumzie chu ainu- vêtin mi a seh a, a sukrinum ang hi a nih."
6,"And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them.","Chuong nia chun mihaiin thina zawng an ta, hmu dêr si naw ni hai; thi inhâwk an ta, nisienlakhawm, thina chun tlân san a tih."
7,"And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as men’s faces.","Chun, khâuhai piengzie chu sakawr, indona dinga inzosa ang an nih; lallukhum ang el rângkachak ang an khum a, an hmai khawm mihriem hmai ang a nih."
8,"And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.","Nuhmei sam ang hi sam an nei a, an ha khawm chu sakeibaknei ha ang a nih."
9,"And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war.","Thîr âwmphaw ang hi âwmphaw an nei a; an thla zâp ri chu indona tawlailîr ri, sakawr tamtak indo dinga tlân dur dur ri ang a nih."
10,"And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months.","Ainuvêt mei ang hin mei an nei a, sêna khawm; chun, an meia chun a nih thla nga sûnga an mihriem suknat theina chu a um chu."
11,"They have over them as king the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek tongue he hath the name Apollyon.","Vânsam khur tirko chu an chunga laltakah an nei a, Hebrai ṭawngin a hming chu Abaddon a nih, Grik ṭawng ruok chun a hming chu Apolluon a nih."
12,"The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter.","Chungrikna hmasatak chu a bo tah a, ngai ta, tuta hnung chungrikna pahni la um a tih."
13,"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,","Chun, vântirko parukna chun a hang mût a; chuongchun, Pathien hmaa rângkachak mâichâm kihaia inthawk chun rawl ka hriet a."
14,"one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.","Chu rawl chun vântirko paruk- na, tawtawrâwt chawi kuoma chun, “Euphrates vadunga vântirko pali khuophai kha sût rawh,” a ta."
15,"And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.","Chuongchun, chu dârkâr le ni le thla le kuma ding chun, mihriem hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat suk- hlumtu dinga buotsai tah, vântirko palihai chu an sût tah a."
16,And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them.,Sipai sakawr chung chuonghai chu an tam tieng sîng ruoka hmun sîng hni an nih; an tam tieng chu mi hril ka hriet a nih.
17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of the horses are as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone.","Chun, inlârnaa chun sakawr le an chunga chuonghai chu hieng ang hin ka hmu a nih, mei le ngên le kât ang hi âwmphaw an nei a, Sakawr luhai chu sakeibaknei lu ang hi a nih, an baua inthawk chun mei le meikhu le kâthai a suok a."
18,"By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths.",Chuong hremna pathum hai chun mihriem hmun thuma ṭhea hmun khat chu a sukhlum tah a–mei le meikhu le kât an baua inthawka suok khan.
19,"For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they hurt.","Sakawrhai thilthawtheina chu an baua le an meiah a nih a um chu. An meihai chu rûl ang a na, luhai a nei bawk a; chu chun a nih mi an suknat hlak chu."
20,"And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:","Mihriem, chuong hremnaa sukhlum mahlahai chu, an kut thilthawhaia inthawk chun an sim chuong nawh a. Khawhrihai le râng- kachak milim dâm, tangka milim dâm, dâr milim dâm, lung milim dâm, thing milim dâm, iengkhawm hmu theilo, hre theilo le lâwn theilo dâm biek chu an ma chuong nawh."
21,"and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.","An tuolthathai khawm, an dawi hmanghai khawm, an indithai khawm, an inrûkhai khawm an sim chuong nawh."
