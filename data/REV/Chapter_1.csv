1,"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show unto his servants, even the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John;","Isu Krista thuphuongsuo, Pathienin a suokhai inhriettir dinga a kuoma a pêk, thil hung um vak ding thu chu; chu chu a vântirko hmangin a suok Johan kuomah a hung inhriettir a;"
2,"who bare witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, even of all things that he saw.","chu Johan chun, Pathien thu le Isu Krista inhriettirna thu, a thil hmu po pohai chu ân hriettir a."
3,"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written therein: for the time is at hand.",Hi hrillâwkna bu thu tiemtu le ngaia a sûnga thu ziek pawmtuhai chu an hamṭha; a hun chu a hnai ta sih a.
4,"John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne;","Johan chun: Asia rama kohran pasarihai kuoma chun: Um zing le um ta le hung um ding kuoma inthawk dâm, a lalṭhungpha hmaa thlarau pasari umhai kuoma inthawk dâm,"
5,"and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our sins by his blood;","Isu Krista, thu hretu ringumtak, mithi laia inthawka tho hmasatak le hnuoia lalhai rorêltu kuoma inthawk dâm chun, lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se. A mi hmangai a, a thisenin ei suolhaia inthawkin a mîn tlan suok a,"
6,"and he made us to be a kingdom, to be priests unto his God and Father; to him be the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.","khuoletui le a Pathien le a Pa tienga thiempua mi siemtu kuomah, anih, ama kuom ngeiah, ropuina le rorêlna chu chatuonin um raw se! Amen."
7,"Behold, he cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they that pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen.","Ngai ta u, ama chu sûmhai le chun a hung ding a nih; mit tinrêngin hmûng an ta, a suntuhai ngei khawm khan; khawvêla hnam po poin ama ṭa bawk an tih. Chuong angtak chun ning a tih, Amen."
8,"I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.","“Kei Alpha le Omega ka nih,” Lalpa Pathien um zing le um ta le hung um ding, Iengkimthawthei chun a ti a nih."
9,"I John, your brother and partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patience which are in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.","Kei Johan, in unaupa le, Isu rinumna dâm, khuoletui dâm, selna dâm inṭâwmpuitu cheu hi, Pathien thu lei le, Isu inhriettirna thu leiin Patmos thlierkâr an tia chun ka um a."
10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet","Lalpa nia chun Thlarauin ka lo um a; chun, ka hnung tiengah, tawtawrâwt ri ang, rawl inringtakin,"
11,"saying, What thou seest, write in a book and send it to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.","“I thil hmu ding chu lekhabuah ziek la, kohran pasarihai kuomah, Ephesia dâm, Smurnaa dâm, Pergamosa dâm, Thuatiraa dâm, Sardisa dâm, Philadelphiaa dâm, Laodikeia dâm chun thawn rawh,” a ti ka hriet a."
12,And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;,"Chun, a mi biekna rawl chu hmu tumin ka hang nghale tah a. Ka hang nghale chun, rângkachak khâwnvar siena pasari ka hmuh a;"
13,"and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle.","khâwnvar siena lai chun, mi tu amanih mihriem naupa ang, ke lêr chena puon sil, a âwma rângkachak kâwngkhia inkhit ka hmu bawk a."
14,"And his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;","A lu le a sam chu berâm hmul vâr angin a vâr a, vûr ang elin; a mithai chu meichawk ang a nih."
15,"and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.","A kephahai chu dâr tle mi ang a na, raw tuina meia raw thieng ta ang elin; a rawl chu tui tamtak ri ang el a nih."
16,And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.,"A kut chang tieng chun arasi pasari a chawi a; a baua inthawk chun kâwlhnâm ngeituo ngeitak a suok a, a hmêl chu nisa sat vânglai tak ang a nih."
17,"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last,","Ama chu ka hmu phingleh thi ang dêrin a ke bulah ka tlu tah a. Ama chun a kut changtieng chu ka chunga innghatin,ka kuomah, “Ṭi naw rawh; kei Hmasatak le, Nu- hnungtak le,"
18,"and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.","Mi Hring chu ka nih, ka lo thi a, nisienlakhawm, ngai ta, kumkhuoa dingin ka hring nâwk ta a nih. Thina le Mithi Khaw chabihai chu ka nei bawk a."
19,"Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter;","“Chuongchun, i thil hmu tahai le thil um zinghai le tuta hnunga thil hung um dinghai thu chu ziek rawh;"
20,"the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.","ka kut changtienga arasi pasari um i hmuhai le, rângkachak khâwn- var siena pasarihai thurûk chu, Arasi pasari chu kohran pasarihai tirko an na, khâwnvar pasari chu kohran pasarihai chu an nih."
