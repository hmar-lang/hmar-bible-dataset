1,"And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?","Aw nangni Jakobhai hotuhai le Israel sûngkuo rorêltuhai; ngai unla, ka ngên cheu hi, ka ti a nih; rorêl dân chu in hriet ding an nâwm a nih?"
2,"ye who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;","Thil ṭha in theida a, thil ṭha naw in ngaituoh a, an vun in inhlippêk a, an rua inthawkin taksa chu in sâwk- thlâk a,"
3,"who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.","ka mihai sa in fâk bawk a, an vun an khawk thlâk a, an ru an suk- tliekpêk a; anih, bêla suong ding angin an chan nawi a, sabêl sûnga sa chan nawi ang elin."
4,"Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he will not answer them; yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.","Chu pha chun LALPA chu ko an ta, nisienlakhawm, anni chu dawn naw nih: anih, chu pha chun an thil thawah an thaw ṭhat nawzie ang peiin, an kuom tieng a hmai thup a tih."
5,"Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:","Ka mihai insuksuoltirtu, sawi nei pumin, “Muongna,” tia khêk a, an baua inba naw taphawt do buotsai hieltu zâwlneihai chungchâng thu chu LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih:"
6,"Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.","Chuleiin, inlârna in nei naw hielna dingin in kuomah zân hung tlung a ta, ai in sân thei nawna khawpin in kuomah inthimna hung tlung a tih; zâwlneihai ta ding chun nisa liem a ta, sûn khawm an chunga chun khaw inthim nîng a tih."
7,"And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.","Hmutheituhai chu inzak an ta, aisânthiemhai chu muolpho an tih; anih, an rêngin an hmûr hup an tih; Pathien dawnna a um si nawh a."
8,"But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.","Nisienlakhawm, Jakobhai kuom- a an bawsietna inhriettir dingin le, Israelhai kuoma an suolna inhriettir dingin LALPA thlarau leia thil- thawtheina dâm, rorêlna dâm le hrâtna dâm chun ka sip takzet a nih."
9,"Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity.","Nangni Jakobhai sûngkaw hotu- hai le Israel sûngkaw hotuhai le Israel sûngkaw rorêltu, rorêlna tir- daka, indikna tinrêng suklinglettu- hai, hi hi lo ngai ro, ka ngên cheu hi."
10,"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.","Zion chu thisenin an bâwl a, Jerusalem chu khawhlonain."
11,"The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.","Chutaka hotuhai chun lâwm- man beiseiin ro an rêl a, chutaka thiempuhai chun hlaw beiseiin an inchûktir a, chutaka zâwlneihai chun tangka beiseiin ai an sân a nih: Chuong sa khawm chun, “LALPA chu eini lai a um naw am a nih? Thil ṭha naw ei chungah hung tlung naw nih,” tiin LALPA chungah an innghat a nih."
12,"Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.","Chuleiin, Zion chu, nangni lei chun lo anga inlet nîng a ta, Jerusa- lem chu thil se um khâwm nîng a ta, biekin umna tlâng chu ramhnuoi hmun insâng ang nîng a tih."
