1,"But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of Jehovah’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it.","Nisienlakhawm, ni nuhnungahai chun hieng ang hi hung nîng a ta; LALPA in umna tlâng chu tlâng lien- hai chunga chun sukdet nîng a ta, tlâng chînhai chunga chun chawi- sângin um bawk a tih; chutaka chun chi tinrênghai chu fe hum hum an tih."
2,"And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;","Chun, hnam tamtakhai chu fêng an ta, “Hung unla, LALPA tlângah, Jakob Pathien ina chun hang fêng ei tiu; chuongchun, ama chun a lampui chanchinhai chu mîn chûktir a ta, a lampuihaia chun fêng ei ta, tîng an tih; Ziona inthawk chun dân thu chu a hung suok ding a ni sih a; LALPA thu chu Jerusalema inthawkin a hung suok ding a nih.”"
3,"and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.","Ama chun chi tamtak kârah ro rêl a ta, hlataka hnam hrâttak khawm chu kâwk a tih; chun, an kâwlhnâm- hai chu hnuoi inletna hmawr zum- haiah sut an ta, an feihai chu thei kûng ât bawngna chem inkuoihaiah sut an tih; hnam dangin hnam dang chungah kâwlhnâm inlet ta naw nih a, indo dân khawm inchûk ta naw bawk an tih."
4,But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.,"Mi tinhai chu an grêp hrui hnuoia le an theichang kûng hnuoiah ṭhung lem an ta, tukhawma sukṭi naw ni hai; sipaihai LALPA bau chun a hril tah a."
5,For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.,"Chi tin mâni pathien hming sengin um an ta, eini khawm LALPA ei Pathien hmingin kumkhuoin um ei tih."
6,"In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;","LALPAIN hieng ang hin a tih: Chu nia chun kebai kei khâwm ka ta, hnawt hmanga um le ka sukrimsika um chu kei khâwm ka tih;"
7,"and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.","kebai chu hlâbîkah siem ka ta, hlataka hnawt hmanga um chu hnam hrâttakah siem ka tih: tuta inthawk chu Zion tlângah kumkhuoin LALPA chun an chungah ro rêl a tih."
8,"And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.","Aw nang, ran ruol kul, Zion naunu umna tlâng, i kuomah hung tlung a tih: anih, inlalna hmasa chu hung tlung a tih, Jerusalem naunu inlalna chu."
9,"Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?",Iengdinga i ṭap rak am a na? I sûngah laltak chu a um naw am a nih? I remruottu chu a bohmang ta am a nih? Nuhmei nau invawi anga natnain a man el ta che chu!
10,"Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.","Aw Zion naunu, nuhmei nau invawi nau nei ding angin na tuor la, invawi rawh; tuhin khawpuia in- thawk fe suok i ta, ramah chêng i tih. Babulon chen khawmin i fe ding a ni sih a: chutaka chun sansuokin um i ta, chutaka chun i hmêlmahai kuta inthawkin LALPA chun sansuok a ti che."
11,"And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see our desire upon Zion.","Tuhin hnam tamtak chu nang- ma doin an inkhâwm a, “Sukpawr- chein um sienla, ei mit hin Zion chunga a châk zâwng chu hmu raw se,” an tih a."
12,"But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.","Nisienlakhawm, LALPA ngai- tuonahai chu an hriet nawh a, a remruot chu an hriet thiem bawk nawh: hrizâwla buphal siekhâwm angin anni chu ân khâwm ta sih a."
13,"Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto Jehovah, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.","Aw Zion naunu, tho la chîl rawh, i ki chu thîr angin siem ka ta, i kepha bâwrhai chu dâr angin ka siem ding a ni sih a; chun, chi tamtakhai chu vaw nâwi i ta, an thil hlêp chu LALPA ta dingin hlânthieng i tih, an sum chu leihnuoi pumpui LALPA ta dingin hlânthieng i tih."
