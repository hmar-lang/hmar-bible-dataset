1,"For I would have you know how greatly I strive for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;","Nangni le Laodikeia umhai le, taksaa ka hmêl hmu naw phawthai ta dingin iengti raua nasain am ka thaw pêk ṭâl ṭâl zie cheu hi in hriet ka nuom sih a."
2,"that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, even Christ,","Chuongchun, hrieta ring tlatna lukhâwng po po chu dawng dinga hmangainaa insuikhawmin an lungrilhai chu thlamuonga a um thei a, Pathien thurûk Krista ngei chu an hriet theina dingin;"
3,in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.,amaa chun varna le hrietna ro po po thupin a um sih a.
4,"This I say, that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.","Tûkhawma bau thiema an hlêm nâwna ding cheuin, chuong chu ka ti a nih."
5,"For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.","Ka taksain in kuomah um naw lang khawm, in felzie le Krista in ring detzie hre zingin lâwmtakin thlaraua chun in kuomah ka um sih a."
6,"As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,","Chuleiin, Krista Isu, Lalpa chu in pawm ang khan amaa chun um ro."
7,"rooted and builded up in him, and established in your faith, even as ye were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.","Amaa zung kei le, rem sâng deu deua umin, an inchûktir ang cheu khan, lâwmthu hrilna hauin, in ringnaa chun dettakin um ro."
8,"Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ:","Fimkhur ro, chuong naw chun, tûkhawmin Krista thu ang ni loin, mihriem thurosie le khawvêl A AW B ang lemin an thu var le hlêmna mei meiin râl lâkin la rawi an ti cheu."
9,"for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,",Amaa chun Pathien famkimna tinrêng chu taksa neiin a um zing sih a.
10,"and in him ye are made full, who is the head of all principality and power:","Amaa chun in famkim ta bawk a, ama chu inlalna le thuneina po po lu a nih."
11,"in whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;","Krista sertannaa chun mihriem tisa suol chu hlîp vawngin, ama bawka chun kuta sertan ni lova sertan in ni kha."
12,"having been buried with him in baptism, wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.","Baptismaa chun a kuoma phûm in lo ni ve ta sih a, chu bawka chun mithi laia ama keithotu Pathien sinthaw awi leia a kuoma keitho in ni ve kha."
13,"And you, being dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you, I say, did he make alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses;","Chun, nangni bawsietnahai le tisaa sertan nâwna leiin thi in lo nih a, nangni ngei chu ama leh a sukhring cheu in ni kha. Ei baw- sietnahai po po a mi ngaidam a."
14,"having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;","Batna lekha thupêka ziek, ei chunga um a mi kal hlaktu chu a thaibo ta sih a; chu ngei chu krawsa hemdein a lâk hmang tah a."
15,"having despoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.","Chun, inlalna le thuneinahai chu hlîp thlain, chu krawsa chun chuonghai chu hnein, ân langa inhriettirnain a hmang tah a."
16,"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day:","Chuongchun, fâk thua manih, dâwn thua manih, ruoiṭhe ni thua manih, thla thar thua manih, châwlni thua manih tûkhawmin sawisêl naw raw hai se cheu;"
17,which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ’s.,"chuonghai chu thil hung tlung dinghai hlim a nih, a tak ruok chu Krista ta a nih."
18,"Let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,","Mâni insukhnuoi fâwmna le vântirko biekna ngaisâng a, inlârnaa innghat a, an tisa tieng nuom zâwng hlêmna mei meia insukpuithu mi an um a; chuong ang mihai chun in lâwmman chu inchântir naw raw hai se cheu."
19,"and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increaseth with the increase of God.","Lu chu an chel tlat si nawh a. Ama, Lua chun, taksa hlawmpui chu, inzawmna le khuopnahaia châwm le inzawmkhâwma umin, Pathien inṭhang liennain ân ṭhanglien hlak a ni sih a."
20,"If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances,","Khawvêl dânhai chu Krista kuoma in thi san ve ta chun, iengdinga khawvêla la hring anga hieng thupêk,"
21,"Handle not, nor taste, nor touch","“Them naw la, intem naw la, tâwk bawk naw” ti mihriemhai dân siemfâwm le inchûktirna hnuoia hin in intuklût am?"
22,"(all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and doctrines of men?",Chuonghai chu hmang puma bohmang ding a nih.
23,"Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.","Hieng vântirko biek ding ti dâm, mâni insukhnuoi ti dâm le, tak- sa sukrinum ding tihai hi thaw âwm takin ân lang ngei; nisienlakhawm, taksa nuom zâwng hnêna ding chun iengkhawm a ṭhahnem chuong dêr nawh."
