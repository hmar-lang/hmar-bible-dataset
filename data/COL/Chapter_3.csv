1,"If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.","Chuongchun, Krista kuomah keithoin in um ve ta chun, chung tieng, Pathien changtienga ṭhung Krista umnaa thil umhai chu zawng ro;"
2,"Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.","chung tienga thil umhaia chun in lungril innghat tlat ro, hnuoia thil umhaia chun innghat loin."
3,"For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.","In thi tah a, in hringna chu Pathiena chun Krista kuomah thupin a um sih a."
4,"When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.",Krista in hringna chu a hung inlâr pha chun nangni khawm ama kuomah ropuiin inlâr vêng in tih.
5,"Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;","Chuongchun, nangnia um hnuoi tieng thilhai chu sukhlum ro, inditna dâm, inthieng nawna dâm, hurna dâm, châkna suol dâm, duâmna dâm hi, duâmna chu milim biekna a ni sih a."
6,for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:,Chuong thilhai lei chun a nih Pathien lunginsenna chu awi naw nauhai chungah a hung tlung hlak chu.
7,"wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived in these things;","Nangni khawm inhmaa chuong ang thilhaia in hring lai khan, chuonghaia chun in um hlak kha."
8,"but now do ye also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:","Tu ruok hin chu nangni khawmin hieng po po, inngâwkna dâm, lunginsenna dâm, theidâna dâm, hrilsietna dâm, in baua suok ṭawng zâmawhai hi sukbo ro."
9,"lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings,","Khêl inhril tuo naw ro, mihriem hlui chu a thilthawhai leh in hlîp thlâk tah a."
10,"and have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him:","Mihriem thar chun in inthuom ta sih a, chu mihriem thar chu, hriet famkimna nei dingin a siemtu angpui anga siem tharin a um mêk a nih;"
11,"where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.","chutaka chun Grik mi le Juda mi, sertan le tan lo, hnamchawm dâm, Skuthia mi dâm, suok dâm, suok naw dâm khawm an um thei nawh, Krista chu iengkim ni lemin, iengkimah a um bawk a nih."
12,"Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;","Chuongchun, Pathien mi thlang, mi inthieng le dittakhai angin inlai- natna lungril dâm, ngilneina dâm, inngaitlâwmna dâm, thuhnuoirawlna dâm, dawtheina dâm chun inthuom ro."
13,"forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye:","Tûkhawmin tu chunga khawm thupawi nei ang unla, indaw tuoin, inngaidam tuo unla, Lalpa chun a ngaidam ang tak cheu khan ngaidam ve ro."
14,"and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.","Chun, chuong po po chunga chun hmangaina inbel ro, chu chu khuop famkimna a nih."
15,"And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful.","Chun, Krista thlamuonna chun in lungrilah ro rêl raw se; chuong ang ni dingin taksa pumkhata ko in ni hrim in sawnnaw; lawm nachâng hre bawk ro."
16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.","Krista thu chu varna tinrêngin nangnia chun um ṭeu raw se; inpâkna hla dâm, Pathien hla dâm, thlarau tieng hla dâma inchûktirin inkâwk tuo unla, lungrila lâwmna neiin Pathien chu hla sakpêk ro."
17,"And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.","Chun, in thaw taphawt chu, thu hril amanih, thil thaw amanih, ama zârah Pa Pathien kuomah lâwmthu hril pumin Lalpa Isu hmingin thaw vawng ro."
18,"Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.","Nuhmeihai, Lalpaa a âwmtâwk ang peiin, in pasalhai kuomah intuklût ro."
19,"Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.","Pasalhai, in nuhmeihai hma- ngai unla, an kuomah vîn naw ro."
20,"Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.","Naupanghai, iengkimah in nu le pahai thu zâwm ro; chu chu Lalpaa chun lâwm a um sih a."
21,"Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.","Pahai, in nauhai suknuor naw ro, chuong naw chun, an bei dawng rawi a tih."
22,"Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:","Suokhai, tisaa in hotuhai thu hi iengkimah zâwm ro; mihriem suk- lâwmtuhai ang ela mit rawng bâwl loin, lungril hmunkhat puta Lalpa ṭi dêk pumin zâwm lem ro."
23,"whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men;","Iengkim in thaw taphawt chu mihriem ta ding anga thaw loin, Lalpa ta ding anga thaw lemin, inhâwktakin thaw ro;"
24,knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ.,a thungna rohluo ding chu Lalpa kuoma inthawkin in hmu ding a nih ti hre zingin Lalpa Krista rawng in bâwl a ni hi.
25,For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.,"Thil indik naw thawtu chun a thil indik naw thaw man hmûng a tih, mi thlier bîkna hrim a um si nawh a."
