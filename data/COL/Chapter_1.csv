1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,","Paula, Pathien dit zâwnga Krista Isu tirko le Timothe, ei unaupa chun:"
2,to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ that are at Colossæ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.,"Kolossaa Kristaa mi inthienghai le unau ringumhai kuoma chun, Pathien ei Pa kuoma inthawka lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se."
3,"We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,","In ta dinga ṭawngṭai rawpin, Pathien ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pa kuoma chun lâwmthu kan hril hlak:"
4,"having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have toward all the saints,","Chu chu, Krista Isua in ringna le mi inthieng po pohai chunga in hmangaina chu kan lo hriet leiin le,"
5,"because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,",vâna in ta dinga beiseina siepêka in um leiin a nih a; Chanchin Ṭha thutak thua in lo hriet ta lei khan a nih.
6,"which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as it doth in you also, since the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth;","Chu Chanchin Ṭha chu, khawvêl pumpuiah malsâwmna hung intlunin a pung pei a; chuong ang takin in kuoma khawm a hung tlung a; titakzeta Pathien lunginsietna chu ngaia in hriet ni chena inthawk khan chu nangnia khawm rain a pung pei a ni kha."
7,"even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,","Epaphra, kan suok chanpui dittaka inthawka in inchûk ngei kha a nih. Ama hi kan aiawa Krista rawngbâwltu ringumtak a na."
8,who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.,Thlarauin nangnia hmangaina ân neitir cheu thu keini mi hriltu kha a ni bawk.
9,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,","Chuleichun, Thlarau tieng varna le hriet theina po poa a dit zâwng hrietnaa chun in hung sip theina dingin, kan hriet nia inthawk chu keini khawma ṭawngṭai le hnipêk cheu kan ma nawh a."
10,"to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;","Chuongchun, sinthaw tinrênga hung rah a, Pathien hrietna kawnga hung inṭhang deu deu a, kawng tinrênga ama suklungawi dinga Lalpa zui tlâka in um theina ding le,"
11,"strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;",hlimtaka selna le dawtheina tinrêng nei dinga a ropuina hrâtzie ang peia hrâtna tinrênga sukhrâta in um theina dingin kan ngênpêk cheu.
12,"giving thanks unto the Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;","Pa, vara mi inthienghai ro chu inṭâwmpui tlâka mi hung siemtu, kuoma chun lâwmthu hril pei bawkin."
13,"who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;","Ama chun inthim thuneinaa in- thawka mi sansuokin, a Naupa hmangaitak rama chun a mîn kai tir tah a,"
14,"in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins:",amaa chun ei intlanna ei hmu a nih-ei suolhai ngaidamna chu
15,"who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;","Ama chu hmu thei naw Pathien angpui, nau lutîr, thilsiemhai po po nêka chunghnung lem a nih."
16,"for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him;","Amaa chun iengkim siem a ni sih a; vâna umhai, hnuoia umhai leh, hmu thei lo le hmu theihai le chun, lalṭhungphahai khawm, rorêlnahai khawm, inlalnahai khawm, thunei- nahai khawm, iengkim amaa chun, ama ta ding bawka siem a nih."
17,"and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.","Chun, ama hi chu iengkim um hmain a um hrim a nih, amaa chun iengkim a ngir khâwm bawk a nih."
18,"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.","Ama chu a taksa -- Kohran lu a na, iengkima a chunghnung tak a hung ni theina dingin, a bulpui, mithi laia inthawka tho hmasatak chu a nih."
19,For it was the good pleasure of the Father that in him should all the fulness dwell;,"Pa lungni zâwngtak chu hi hi a ni sih a: Pathien famkimna tinrêng chu amaa a um zing le,"
20,"and through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, I say, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.","a kraws thisen chun inremna hung siemin, amaa chun iengkim, ama ngeia chun hnuoia thil umhai le vâna thil umhai khawm, ama le inremtir hi."
21,"And you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,","Chun, nangni inhmaa in thil suksuolnaa khan amaa inthawka ṭhein in lo um a, in lungrila chun hmêlma in lo ni bawk kha."
22,"yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:","Nisienlakhawm, tuhin chu a taksa thina ngei khan ama leh ân remtir ta cheu a nih, a hmaa chun inthiengtak le hmêlhemlo le, sawisêl boa ân ngirtir theina ding cheuin."
23,"if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister.","Amiruokchu, in ringna chun innghatsan neiin dettakin in um ding a nih. Chanchin Ṭha in ihriet beiseinaa inthawk sawn hmangin um naw ro. Chu Chanchin Ṭha chu vân hnuoia thilsiem po po laia tlângin- sampui a ni kha; kei Paula hi, chu rawngbâwltua siem chu ka nih."
24,"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church;","Tuta ka tuorpêkna cheua hin ka lâwm a, Krista rinum tuor bâk chu a taksa leiin ka taksaa hin ka sunzawm pei a nih, a taksa chu kohran hi a nih."
25,"whereof I was made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which was given me to you-ward, to fulfil the word of God,",Pathien thu hril kim dinga enkawlna sin Pathienin in ta dinga a mi pêk ang peiin chuonghai rawng- bâwltua siem ka nih.
26,"even the mystery which hath been hid for ages and generations: but now hath it been manifested to his saints,",Chu Pathien thu chu chatuon le suon um chena inthawka thurûk inthup kha a nih; tu ruok hin chu a mi inthienghai kuoma inlangtirin a um tah.
27,"to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:",Chuonghai kuoma chun Jentail- hai lai chu thurûk ropuina hauzie chu Pathienin inhriettir a nuom hrim a nih: chu thurûk chu Krista nangnia um ropuina beisei san chu a nih.
28,"whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;","Mi tin Kristaa chun ṭha famkim- a kan inngîrtir theina dingin, mi tin infuiin, mi tin varna tinrênga inchûk- tirin a chanchin kan hril hlak hi;"
29,"whereunto I labor also, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.","chuong anga inngîrtir thei dingin, nasataka keimaa sin a thaw, chu a sinthaw ang peia thaw ṭâlin, ka thaw hrim bawk hlak a nih."
