1,"Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia;","Chuongchun, unauhai, Makedo- nia rama kohranhai laia Pathien lunginsietna pêka um chu kan inhriettir ding cheu a nih;"
2,how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.,khânga rinuma fiena nasatak puma an hlimna a liem le an rimsikna nasatak chu an tiktlaina nasataka ân chang tâkzie kha.
3,"For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,","An theitâwk ang peiin, anih, an theitâwk nêka nasa lemin anni thu thuin an pêk ti ka hrietpui a nih:"
4,beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints:,lunginsietna mi inthienghai rawngbâwla ṭhang ve chu nasataka keini mi hniin.
5,"and this, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.",Chu khawm chu kan ring naw ang takin an thawh a. Pathien dit zâwngin Lalpa kuoma le keini kuomah anni an inpêk hmasa zet zet a nih.
6,"Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.","Chuongchun, inhmaa an lo thaw ṭan ta lei khan hi lunginsietna khawm hi nangnia thaw zo nghâl dingin Tita chu kan ngên ta rau a."
7,"But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.","Chuongchun, iengkim–ringna dâm, thu hril thiemna dâm, hrietna dâm, ṭhahnemngaina po po dâm, in mi hmangaina dâm, in hau ang hin, chu lunginsietna khawm chu in hau theina dingin taimâk suo ro."
8,"I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.","Thupêk tiengin ka hril nawh a, mi dang ṭhahnemngainain in hma- ngaina takzie khawm chu infie dingin ka hril lem a nih."
9,"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna chu, a rimsik leia in hung hausak theina dingin, hausa sienla khawm nangni lei ngeiin a lo rimsi ta kha in hriet sih a."
10,"And herein I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.","Chuongchun, chutaka chun ka ngaidân ang a nih ka hril, chu chu in ta dingin a ṭha sih a, kum khat a ni tah a, a phut hmasatuhai in na, in thaw phut chau khawm ni loin a thaw nuom hmasatak khawm in ni kha."
11,"But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.","Chuongchun, nuom dinga in- zona a um ang khan, in nei ang peia hlenna khawm a um theina dingin, tuhin chu thaw sawng ta ro."
12,"For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according as he hath not.","Inzona chu a um phawt chun, mi a nei naw sa ni loin, a neizie ang peia a pêk chu lâwm tlâk a ni sih a."
13,For I say not this that others may be eased and ye distressed;,"Mi dang inrim loa, nangni in inrimna dinga ka ti a ni nawh a;"
14,"but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality:","inchawkchamna dingin, in nei liem chu tulai hin an tlâksamna phuhrûkna a lo ni thei a, anni nei liem khawm in tlâksamna phuhrûk- na a lo ni ve thung theina dingin ka ti lem a nih; chuongchun, inchawk- chamna hung um thei a tih."
15,"as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.","“A rût tam chun a chuongin a nei nawh a, a rût tlâwm khawm a tlasam chuong nawh,” tia ziek ang khan."
16,"But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.","Chun, in chunga ka ṭhahnem- ngaina ang Tita lungrila pe hlaktu Pathien kuoma chun lâwmthu um raw se."
17,"For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.","Ama chun, kan infuina chu a pawm ngei a, nisienlakhawm, kan infui lei chau ni loin, ama ngei khawm chu ṭhahnemngai tak a na, ama thu thuin in kuoma hung dingin a suok ta a nih."
18,And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is spread through all the churches;,"Chun, ama ruolin unaupa kan tir ve ta bawk a, ama chu Chanchin Ṭha kawnga an inpâk thu kohranhai po poah ân thang suok a."
19,"and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to show our readiness:","Chuong chau khawm chu a ni nawh a, Lalpa ropuizie le kan inzozie inentir dinga a rawng kan ibâwl hi lunginsietna thua hin keini le khuo fang ve dingin kohranhai iruot ve hrim a ni bawk a."
20,"avoiding this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us:","A rawng kan ibâwl, hi thilpêk kawnga hin tûkhawma an mi dem nawna dingin kan fimkhur a,"
21,"for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.","Lalpa ngai chau ni loin, mihriem ngai khawma thil mawi kan ngaituo bawk hlak a nih."
22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he hath in you.","Chun, anni ruolin kan unaupa kan hung tir veh a, ama chu kawng tamtaka ṭhahnemngai tak a nih ti vawi tamtak kan infie tah a, tu lem hin chu a ring bêk bêk cheu leiin ṭhahnem a ngai nâwk zuol tah a nih."
23,"Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you-ward; or our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, they are the glory of Christ.","Tita hi chu ka ruolpa le nangni tienga ka sinthawpui a na; chun, kan unauhai hi chu kohranhai tirko, Krista ropuina chu an nih."
24,"Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.","Chuleichun, in hmangai ti hrietna le, kan suongna cheu hrietna chu kohranhai hmaa chun an kuoma hin suklang ro."
