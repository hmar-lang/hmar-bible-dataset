verse_no,en,hmr
1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:","Chuleichun, lunginsietna kan hmu ang peia hi rawngbâwlna hi kan nei leiin kan dawl nawh a;"
2,"but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.","thil inzâpuium inthuphai chu kan mâk ta lem a; zâwrna thu kan hmang nawh a, Pathien thu mi hlêmnain kan hmang bawk nawh a; thutak inhriettirin Pathien mit- hmuin mi tin sie le ṭha hrietna mit kan intlungtir lem hlak a nih."
3,"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish:","Nisienlakhawm, kan Chanchin Ṭha hi inkhuma a um chun bohmang mêkhaia hin a nih inkhuma a um chu."
4,"in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn upon them.","Krista Pathien angpui, a ropuizie Chanchin Ṭha var chun anni a sunvar thei nawna dingin chuongahai chun khawvêl pathienin awinawhai mit a sukdel tah a."
5,"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.","Mâni thu kan hril si nawh a, Krista Isu chu Lalpa a ni kan hril lem hlak, keini khawm Isu leiin suok kan ni kan hril bawk hlak."
6,"Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.","Isu Krista hmêla chun, Pathien ropuizie hrietna var chu mi pe dingin, “Inthima inthawkin var varsuok a tih,” titu Pathien chun kan lungrilhai hi a sunvar ta sih a."
7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;","Nisienlakhawm, thilthawtheina nasatzie chu keini kuoma inthawk ni loin, Pathien ta a ni thei lemna dingin, chu ro chu pil bêlahai kan kawl a nih."
8,"we are pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair;","Khing tieng khing tienga hneng- dein kan um a, nisienlakhawm, kan thuok a dawng si nawh; lunginzîngin kan um a, nisienlakhawm, kan bei a dawng si nawh."
9,"pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed;","Suknawmnatin kan um a, nisien- lakhawm, mâksanin kan um si nawh; vuok thlûkin kan um a; nisienla- khawm, sukbohmangin kan um si nawh."
10,"always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.","Kan taksaa hin kumkhuoin Isu thina chu kan put pei hlak a, Isu hringna khawm kan taksaa hin ân lang theina dingin."
11,"For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.","Keini hringa la umhai hi, Isu leia thi dingin inmantirin kan um rawp a, Isu hringna khawm kan tisa thi theia hin ân lang theina dingin."
12,"So then death worketh in us, but life in you.","Chuongchun, keinia hin thinain sin a thaw hlak a, nangnia ruok chu hringnain sin a thaw hlak a nih."
13,"But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak;","Amiruokchu, “Ka awia, chuleiin thu ka hril a nih,” ti ziek ang khan, chu ringna lungril ngai chu putin, keini khawmin kan awi ve a, chuleiin thu kan hril bawk a;"
14,"knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you.",Lalpa Isu keithotu chun keini khawm Isu kuomah a mi keitho ve ding a na; nangni leh a mîn ngîrtir ding a nih ti kan hriet sih a.
15,"For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God.","Iengkim nangni ṭhatna ding a ni sih a, lunginsietna chu mi tam lem zâra sukpunga umin, Pathien ropui- na dinga lâwmthu nasatak ân hriltir theina dingin."
16,"Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.","Chuleichun, kan dawl nawh a, kan puotieng mihriem hi hung awngrawp tieu tieu sien khawm kan sûng tieng mihriem chu ni tin siem thar peiin a um lem a nih."
17,"For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;","Kan rinum nêptak, hi mit inkhap kâr chaua um ding hin ropuina nasatak, kumkhuoa dingin a mi siem pêk nasa deu deu a nih;"
18,"while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.","thil hmuthei hi en loin, thil hmutheinawhai chu kan en lem sih a; thil hmutheihai hi sâwtnawtêa ding a na, thil hmutheinawhai ruok chu kumkhuoa ding a ni sih a."
