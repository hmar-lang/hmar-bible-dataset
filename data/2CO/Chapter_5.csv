1,"For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.","Ei umna hnuoia in hi ṭiek sien khawm, vânah, in kuta bawl lo, kumkhuoa um zing ding, Pathien kuoma in nghet chu ei nei ti ei hriet sih a."
2,"For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:","Vâna ei umna ding sil thuo inhâwk bêk bêkin hi ina hin ei inrûm tak meu hlak sih a; chuong anga silin um inla, saruokin um nâwng ei tih."
3,if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.,Eini hi umnaa umhai hi rik phurin ei inrûm takzet sih a;
4,"For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.","sil loa um ei nuom lei a ni nawh a, sil thuoa um ei nuom lei a nih, thithei hi hringna ilem zoa a um theina dingin."
5,"Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.","Chun, chu thil ngei dinga a mibuotsaitu chu Pathien a nih, zakhamna Thlarau mi petu kha."
6,"Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord","Chuongchun, taksaa ei um sûngin, Lalpa kuomah ei um nawh ti hrein kumkhuoin muongtakin ei um hlak;"
7,"(for we walk by faith, not by sight);","(hmutheia fe loin, ringnain ei fe lem sih a);"
8,"we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.","muongtakin ei um ka ti a nih, taksaa um loa Lalpa kuoma um ei nuom lem."
9,"Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.","Chuleiin, um inla um naw inla khawm, ama lâwm zâwng ni ei tum tlat hlak a nih."
10,"For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.","Mi tinin taksaa ei thilthawhai a sie a ṭhaa ei thaw ang peia ei hmu seng theina dingin, Krista rorêlna ṭhungpha hmaa chun suklangin ei um vawng ding a ni sih a."
11,"Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.","Chuongchun, Lalpa ṭina châng hrein, mihriemhai chu kan thlêm hlak a, Pathien kuoma ruok chun inlangtirin kan um a; nangni sie le ṭha hrietnaa khawm inlangtira kan um ka beisei."
12,"We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.","In kuomah kan inhrilmawi nâwk a ni nawh a, lungril tieng ni loa, ân lang el zawngtuhai chu ieng amanih dawnna in nei theina dingin keini tienga suongna san siempêk cheuin kan hril lem a nih."
13,"For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.","Kan invêt leh Pathien ta ding a na, kan var leh nangni ta ding a ni sih a."
14,"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;","Krista hmangaina chun keini a mi tirlui a nih, hieng ang hin kan ngaituo; mi po po thi aiin mi pakhat a thih a, chuleiin, mi po po chu an thi a nih."
15,"and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.","Chun, a hringhai chu anni ta dinga hring ni ta loa, an thi aia thia thonâwk ta ding chun an hring ta lemna dingin a nih, mi po po aia a thi chu."
16,"Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.","Chuleichun, tuta chena hin, keini chun tisa tienga chun tûkhawm hre ta naw ning ungah; tisa tiengah Krista chu lo hre ta inlang khawm, tuhin chu kan hriet nâwk ta nawh."
17,"Wherefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.","Chuleichun, tûkhawm Kristaa a um chun thilsiem thar a hung ni tah a; thil hluihai chu a bo tah a, ngai ta u, a hung thar tah."
18,"But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;","Nisienlakhawm, iengkim Pa- thiena inthawka suok a nih; ama chun Krista leiin ama le inremin a mi siem a, inremna rawngbâwl sin a mi pêk a;"
19,"to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.","khânga, Pathienin Kristaa chun khawvêl hi ama le inremin a siem a, an bawsietnahai chu baw- sietnaa ruot pêk loin, inremna thu a mîn kawltir kha."
20,"We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech you on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.","Chuongchun, Krista aia palai kan na, Pathienin keini hmangin a ngên cheu ti thei a nih. “Pathien leh hung inrem ro,” tiin Krista aiin kan ngên cheu a nih."
21,Him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.,Amaa chun Pathien felna ei hung ni theina dingin suol hrim hrim hre lo chu Pathienin eini leiin suolah a siem a.
