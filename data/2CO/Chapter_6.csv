5,"in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;","vuoknaa dâm, lungin intângnaa dâm, buoinaa dâm, sininrimnaa dâm, intheinawnaa dâm, bu ngheinaa dâm,"
6,"in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,","inthiengnaa dâm, hrietnaa dâm, dawtheinaa dâm, ngilneinaa dâm, Thlarau Inthienga dâm, hmangaina taktaka dâm;"
7,"in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,","Thutak thua dâm, Pathien thilthawtheinaa dâm, changtieng le vawitienga felna hriemhreihaiin,"
8,"by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;","sukropuina le sukmuolphonain, hming hril siet le hming hril ṭhatin, hlêmtu angin, mi indiktak ni siin,"
9,"as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;","mi hriet khawp naw angin, hming inthangtak siin, thi vâng vâng angin, ngai ta u, kan hring sih a; thunun angin sukhluma um si loin;"
10,"as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.","lungngai angin, nisienla- khawm, lâwm rawp siin; pasie angin, nisienlakhawm, mi tamtak sukhausa siin; iengkhawm neilo angin, iengkim hau siin."

13,"Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.","Chuongchun, nauhai kuoma hril ang elin ka hril cheu; nangni tienga lungril kan put ang hi, mîn hmutir ve unla, in lungril hawng lien ve ro."
14,Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?,"Awinawhai leh inruolnawtaka rîngkawl bât hmunkhatin um naw ro; rîtlona le felnain ieng am inṭawmna an nei a? Annawleh, inthim le varin ieng am inpâwlna an nei a?"

16,"And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.","Milimhai le Pathien biekin khawmin ieng am inremna an nei a? Eini chu Pathien hring biekin ei ni sih a; Pathienin, “Anniah um ka ta, Anniah lêng bawk ka ta; Chun, an Pathien nîng ka ta, Anni khawm ka mihai nîng an tih”, a ti ang khan."

18,"And will be to you a Father, And ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.","In ta dingin Pa nîng ka ta, Nangni khawm keia ta dingin naunu naupa ning in tih,” Lalpa iengkimthawthei chun a tih."
