1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:","Paula, Pathien ditzâwnga Krista Isu tirko le ei unaupa Timothe chun: Korintha Pathien kohran um- hai kuomah, Akaia rama mi inthieng um po pohai kuoma leh:"
2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.,Pathien ei Pa le Lalpa Isu Krista kuoma inthawka lunginsietna le inremna in kuomah um raw se.
3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;","Ei Lalpa Isu Krista Pathien le Pa, lunginsietnahai Pa le thlamuong- na po po Pathien chu inpâkin um raw se."
4,"who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.","Pathienin keini a mi thlamuonna ngeiin, rinum ieng anga umhai khawm chu kan thlamuon ve theina dingin, ama chun kan rinumna po poah a mi thlamuon hlak."
5,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.",Krista tuornahai chu kan chungah a sipliem angtakin kan thla- muongna hi Krista zârah a sipliem a nih.
6,"But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:","Nisienlakhawm, rinuma kan um leh nangnirawi thlamuongna ding le sandamna ding a na, thlamuonga kan um leh nangni thlamuong vena ding a nih; chu chun ka rinum tuor bawk hi seltaka in tuornaa chun a thaw hlak a nih."
7,"and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.","Chun, rinumna chang vehai in ni angin, thlamuongna chang vehai in ni bawk ti kan hrietin, kan beisei pêkna cheu hi a det a nih."
8,"For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:","Unauhai, Asia rama kan chunga rinumna tlung thu kha in hriet naw kan nuom nawh a, khânga nasataka tuor zo ruol loa, dam hrim khawm beisei lo khawp hiela deldea kan um kha."
9,"yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:","Anih, keinia chun thi chau hmabâk tah angah kan inhriet a, chu chu mâni inring loa Pathien, mithi keithotu chu, kan ring lemna ding a lo nih."
10,"who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;","Ama chun chuong ang lâwma thina nasaa inthawk chun a mi lo sansuok tah a, mi la sansuok nâwk a tih. Mi la sansuok nâwk pei a tih ti amaa chun beiseina kan innghat a,"
11,"ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.",ṭawngṭaina tamtak dawnnaa malsâwmna kan dawnghai leiin mi tamtakin kan aia lâwmthu hrilna an nei theina dingin nangni khawma ṭawngṭainain mi ṭhangruolpui tlat ro.
12,"For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.","Kan isuong chu hi hi a nih: kan sie le ṭha hrietna thu inhriettir chu, inthiengna le Pathien indikna neiin, tisa varnaah ni loin, Pathien lungin- sietna lemin, khawvêla hin kan châng kha, nangni tiengah kan châng ṭha nâwk zuol a."
13,"For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end:","In tiem hlak a, a awi khawm in iawi bawk hlak naw kha chu, in kuomah thu dang iengkhawm kan ziek nawh a, a tâwp chenin kan thu in awi kan beisei bawk a nih."
14,"as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.",Ei Lalpa Isu nia chun nangni kan isuonghai in ni ding a nih ti nangni mi ṭhenkhatin in mi awipêk ta ang khan.
15,"And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit;","Chun, chu ringna chu neiin, lunginsietna lêt hni in hmu theina dingin in kuomah hung hmasa lang ka tih a,"
16,"and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judæa.","nangni sir malamin Makedonia ramah fe pei lang, Makedonia rama inthawkin nangni kuoma hung lêt nâwk dingin. Chun, Judai rama ka fena dinga chun nangni mîn thlain um lang ka ti bawk a."
17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay?","Chuongchun, chuong ang ka lungril lai khan kan lungril det nawzie inentir am ka nih? Annawleh, ka kuomah, “A nih, a nih,” ti le, “A ni nawh, a ni nawh,” ti chu um ve ve dingin, thil thaw ka tum hlak chu tisa angin am a ni ka tum?"
18,"But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.","Iengkhawm ni raw se, Pathien a ringum angin, nangni tienga ka thu hi “A nih” ti le, “A ni nawh,” ti a ni ve ve si nawh."
19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.","Pathien Naupa Isu Krista, a thu kei le Silvan le Timothein kan ihril kha, “A nih” le “A ni nawh,” a ni ve ve si nawh a; amaa chun, “A nih,” ti a um lem a nih."
20,"For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.","Pathien thutiem chu iengzât khawm ni sien la, amaa chun, “A nih,” ti chu a um sih a. Chuongchun, ama lei khawmin, “Amen,” ti chu a um a nih, keinihai leia Pathien ropuina dingin."
21,"Now he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;","Chun, Kristaa nangni le a mi sukdettu le hriek mi nâltu chu Pathien a nih;"
22,"who also sealed us, and gave us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.",ama chu a mîn chiktu le ei lungrila zakhamna thlarau mi petu a ni bawk a.
23,"But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.","Nisienlakhawm, ka thlarau chunga hretu dingin Pathien ka ko a nih, nangni hla ding cheuin a nih Korinth khuoa ka hung ta naw."
24,"Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for in faith ye stand fast.","In ringna chungah inlalna ka nei ka ti nawh a, in lâwmna ṭhangpuitu ka nih, ka ti lem a nih, ringnaa ngîr in ni sih a."
