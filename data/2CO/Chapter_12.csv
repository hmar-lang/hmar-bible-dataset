1,"I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.","Ka suong hrim hrim ding a nih, ṭhat chu a ṭha nawh a, nisienlakhawm, Lalpa kuoma in- thawka inlârna le inhriettirna thu hril kai pei el ka tih."
2,"I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.","Kristaa mi pakhat ka hriet, ama chu kum sâwm le pali a ni tah a, (taksain amanih a um ka hriet nawh, taksa loin amanih a um ka hriet bawk nawh a, Pathienin a hriet) vân thumna meua khin zuk lâkin a um a."
3,"And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),","Chun, chu ama ngei chu (taksain amanih a um, taksa loin amanih a um ka hriet nawh, Pathienin a hriet)."
4,"how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.","Paradisa lâka a um le, thu hril thei ruol lo mihriem hril thiengnawhai dâm chu a hriet ti ka hriet."
5,"On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my weaknesses.","Mi chuong ang chu suong ka tih; nisienlakhawm, ka hrâtnawna ti lo chu mâni chu insuong naw ning ah."
6,"For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from me.","Suong nuom lang khawm invêt ni naw ning a, thu taktak ka hril ding a ni sih a; nisienlakhawm, insûm ka tih; chuong naw chun, tûkhawmin an mi hmu ang le, keia inthawka thu an hriet ang nêkin mi ngai ropui lem rawi an tih."
7,"And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.","Chun, inhriettirnahai chu a nasa bêk bêk leia kân ngaihlu taluo nawna dingin tisaah hling a mi pêk a nih. Setan tirko, kut inthak nûlnaa mi hmangtu ding chu; chuong naw chun, inngaihlu taluo rawi ka tih."
8,"Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.","Chu chungchâng thua chun, a mîn kiengsan theina dingin Lalpa chu vawi thum ka hnih a."
9,"And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.","Chun, ama chun ka kuomah, “Ka lunginsietna i ta dingin a hun deh, ka thilthawtheina hi hrâtnawnaah i sawnnaw sukfamkima a um,” a ti tah a. Chuongchun, Krista thilthawthei- na chu ka chunga a um theina dingin, lâwmtakin ka hrâtnawnahai hi suong lem tâng ka tih."
10,"Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.","Chuleiin, Krista leiin hrâtnaw- naahai, sietnaahai, hnengdenaahai, suknawmnatnaahai, hnawchêpnaa- hai, ka lâwm hlak a nih; ka hrât naw po leh ka hrât hlak a nih."
11,"I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.","Ka lo invêt a ni ta tie: nangniin invêt lo thei loin in mi siem a nih; kei chu nangni mi chawimawi ding ka nih in sawnnaw, iengkhawm ni naw lang khawm ieng kawnga khawm tirko lientakhai chu ka tluk naw si nawh a."
12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.","Tirko ni inchikna chu selna tinrêng neiin, inchiknahai, thilmak- hai, thilthawtheinahaiin in kuoma thaw a ni tak tak kha."
13,"For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.","Ieng kawng am a na, kohran danghai nêka inhnuoi lema siema in umna chu? Keima ngeiin ka sukkhâwk nawna cheu kawnga khan a ni nghâl naw chun. Chu indik nawnaa chun mi ngaidam ro."
14,"Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.","Ngai ta u, hi hi in kuoma hung dinga kân zo a vawi thumna ding a nih; chun, mîn khâwkpui naw ti niua, in ta chu zawng ka ni si nawh a, nangni a nih ka zawng lem cheu chu; nauhaiin nu le pa ta dingin an inkhâwl pêk ding a ni nawh a, nu le pahaiin nauhai ta dingin an inkhâwl pêk lem ding a ni sih a."
15,"And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?","Kei chu ka nei po po in thlarau ta dingin lâwm takin hmang zo ka ta, kei ngei khawm inhmang zo vawng bawk ka tih. Chuong lâwma ka hmangai si cheu chun in mi hmangai tlâwm lem bîk el ding maw?"
16,"But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.","Amiruokchu, kei chu in mîn khâwkpui naw ni ta phawt sienla; nisienlakhawm, mi vervêk hrim hrim lo niin, zâwrin ka man cheu a lo ni hi!"
17,Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?,In kuoma ka itirhai lai khan tû amani bêk hmangin ka hlâwk pha cheu am a nih?
18,"I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?","Tita chu kân fui a, unaupa chu ama ruolin ka tir a nih. Tita chun hlâwk phâna hrim hrim a nei cheu am a nih? Lungril hmunkhat puta lêng kan ni naw am a nih? Hnung thuhmun chara lêng kan ni naw am a nih?"
19,"Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.","Tuta sûng po hin nangni kuomah kan thiemna thu hrilah in mi ring zing a ni âwm a. Kristaa chun Pathien mithmuah a nih thu kan hril chu. Nisienlakhawm, dittakhai, ieng- kim hi nangni siem ṭhatna ding a nih."
20,"For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;","Ka hung phaa ieng amani tiin ka dit angin hung hmu naw rawi ka ti cheu a, kei khawm in dit angin mi hmu naw rawi in tih, ti le, ieng amani tiin, inhalnahai, inthîknahai, lung- sennahai, inkhingnahai, inrêlnahai, inberua thu lâknahai, inngaihlut taluotnahai, buoinahai hung um rawi a tih ti le;"
21,"lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.","ka hung nâwk pha ka Pathienin nangni lai mi sukmuolpho nâwkin, kha hmaa thil suksuoltuhai lai thil inthiengnaw thaw dâm, indit dâm, hur dâm, chînga sim si lo mi tamtakhai chu ṭa rawi ka tih, ti kân lau in sawnnaw."
