1,"Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?","Mâni inhrilmawi ei phut nâwk ding a ni ta maw? Annawleh, in kuoma pêk ding amanih, in kuoma inthawk amanih hrilmawina lekha, mi ṭhenkhat ta dinga a ngai angin, kan ta dingin a ngai ve ding a ni maw?"
2,"Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;","Nangni hi kan lekha, kan lungrila ziek, mi po po ihriet le tiem chu in nih,"
3,"being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh.","Krista lekha, keini a mîn ziektir, lekhatuia ziek nilo, Pathien hring Thlaraua ziek lem, lung phêka ziek niloa, tisa lung phêka ziek lem chu in nih, ti chiengtaka inlangtir a ni sih a."
4,And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:,"Chun, Pathien tienga chuong ang ringna chu Krista zârah kan nei a nih;"
5,"not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;",iengkhawm keinia inthawka suoka ruot dingin keini ngawtin kan tlin kan ti nawh a; kan tlin theina chu Pathien kuoma inthawk a ni lem.
6,"who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.","Ama bawk chun thuthlung thar rawngbâwltuahai a mîn tlin tir a; lekha thu ela rawngbâwltuahai ni loin, Thlarau rawngbâwltuahai a ni lem; lekha thu ngawt chun a sukhlum hlak sih a. Thlarau ruok chun a sukhring hlak a nih."
7,"But if the ministration of death, written, and engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which glory was passing away:","Mosie hmêl a ropui leiin Israel nauhai chun a hmêl an en zing thei nawh a. (chu ropuina chu a bo ta riei riei a), thina rawngbâwlna lunga hawrawpa ziek hman, chuong ang khawpa ropuiin a tlung chun,"
8,how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?,Thlarau rawngbâwlna chu ieng ang taka ropuiin am a tlung ding chu?
9,"For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.","Thiemnaw inchangtirna rawng- bâwlna hman a ropui chun, felna rawngbâwlna chu ropuina tieng chun a nasa lem bêk bêk ding a nih."
10,"For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.","Sukropuia um ta chun, hi tieng panga hin ropuina hrim a nei si nawh a; ropuina nasa chun a khûm leiin."
11,"For if that which passeth away was with glory, much more that which remaineth is in glory.","Bo riei riei ta hman chu ropuia a tlung chun, um zing ding chu ropuia tuomin a um lem bêk bêk ding a nih."
12,"Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,","Chuongchun, chuong ang bei- seina chu kan nei leiin iengkim kan hril suok hlak a nih;"
13,"and are not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:","Mosie thaw ang khan kan thaw ve nawh, ama chun bo ta riei riei bo tâwpna chu Israel nauhaiin an en zing nawna dingin a hmai chu hmai inkhumnain ân khum a."
14,"but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed to them that it is done away in Christ.",An lungril ruok chu sukngarin a um ta lem a; vawisûn chen khawm hin thuthlung hlui chu an tiemin inkhumna pângngai chu hlîm loin a um zing sih a; chu inkhumna chu Kristaa chun sukboin a um tah a.
15,"But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.","Nisienlakhawm, vawisûn chen hin Mosie Lekhabu an tiem po leh an lungrila chun inkhumna chu a um hlak."
16,"But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.","Nisienlakhawm, an lungril Lalpa tienga an nghat tik tik inkhum- na chu lâkhmang ni tâng a tih."
17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.","Chun, Lalpa chu Thlarau chu a na, Lalpa Thlarau umna taphawta chun zalênna a um hlak."
18,"But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.","Chuongchun, keini chu kan rêngin hmai inkhum loin, hlimen anga Lalpa ropuina sunvarin, ropui- naa inthawka ropui peiin, chu angpui ngeia um dingin, sukdanglamin kan um hlak, Lalpaa (Thlaraua) inthawk- a kan hmu ang peiin."
