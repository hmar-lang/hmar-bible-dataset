verse_no,en,hmr
1,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:","Mi inthienghai rawngbâwl thu chu in kuoma ka ziek a ngai nawh ie,"
2,"for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them.","inzosa zinga um in nih ti ka hriet sih a, chu kawng thua chun, “Kum khat a ni tah, Akaia ram chu inbuotsaiin an um tah,” tiin Makedonia rama mihai kuomah ka suong hlak cheu a; chuongchun, in ṭhahnemngaina chun anni laia mi tamtak a chawkhar tah a."
3,"But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared:","Nisienlakhawm, chu kawng thua chun ka suongna cheu chu ieng- khawm lo a hung ni nawna dingin, unauhai hi ka hung tir a nih, ka hril ang taka inbuotsaia in lo um theina dingin;"
4,"lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence.","chuong naw chun Makedonia rama mi tuhaiin amanih mi lo zui kherin, inbuotsai loa an hung hmu cheu chun, keini hi, (nangni kan ti nawh), kan ringna cheu kawnga hin muolpho rawi kan tih."
5,"I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.","Chuleiin, unauhai hi, thilpêk in itiemlâwk kha lo siem lâwk dinga in kuoma hung hmasa dinga ngên ṭulin ka ring a nih, chu ngei chu lâkpêk ang ni loa, phal taka pêk ang lemin inzosaa a lo umna dingin."
6,"But this I say, He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.","Amiruokchu, chuong ang kawnga chun, the tlâwm chun sîk tlâwm a ta, the tam chun sîk tam a tih."
7,"Let each man do according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.","Mi tinin inro puma pe loin, pêk naw thei naw anga ngaia pe bawk loin, an lungrila an tum ang peiin pe seng raw se; Pathien chun hlimtaka petu chu a nih a hmangai chu."
8,"And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work:","Chun, Pathienin lunginsietna tinrêng in chungah a vur thei a nih; chuongchun, nangnîn iengkimah a hun zet nei rawpin, sin thaw ṭha tinrênga dingin hau thei in tih;"
9,"as it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever.","“A sem dar a; Rimsihai kuomah a pêk a, A felna chu kumkhuoin um zing a tih,” ti ziek ang khan."
10,"And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:","Chun, thetu kuoma chi petu le, fâk dinga bei petu chun in the ding chi chu pe cheuin, sukpung pêk a ti cheu a, in felna ra chu sukhlâwkpêk a ti cheu."
11,"ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.","Tiktlaina tinrêng, keini leiin Pathien kuoma lâwmthu hrilna siem- tu chu nei dinga iengkima sukhau- sakin um in tih."
12,"For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God;","Hi sawmdâwlna rawngbâwlna hin, mi inthienghai chu a phu- hrûkpêk chau khawm a ni nawh a, Pathien kuoma lâwmthu hrilna tamtaka inchangin a luong liem bawk a nih."
13,"seeing that through the proving of you by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all;","Hi rawngbâwlna hin a fiena cheu leiin, Krista Chanchin Ṭha in iawi in zâwmzie lei le, anni ta ding le mi po po ta dinga thawlâwm thawnaa in tiktlaizie lei hin Pathien an sukropui hlak in sawnnaw."
14,"while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.","Anni ngei khawmin in chungah Pathien lunginsietna a nasa bêk bêk leiin, in ta dinga ṭawngṭai pêk zing cheuin an ngai hle cheu a nih."
15,Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.,A thilpêk hril thei ruollo leiin Pathien kuomah lâwmthu um raw se.
