1,"Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.","Chuongchun, dittakhai, chuong thutiem chu ei nei leiin, tisa le thlarau inthiengnaw po poah insuk- fai ei tiu, Pathien ṭi puma inthieng- na sukfamkimin."
2,"Open your hearts to us: we wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man.","In lungrilah hmun mîn kien ro; tu chunga khawm kan suksuol ngai nawh a, tûkhawm kan sukkhawhlo nawh a, tûkhawm kan tlâkkhal nawh."
3,"I say it not to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die together and live together.","Chu chu thiemnaw inchangtir ding cheuin ka ti a ni nawh a, thi leh thi tlânga, dam leh dam tlâng dingin kan lungrila hin kan invawi cheu ti inhma el khan ka hril cheu kha."
4,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying on your behalf: I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.","Nangni tienga chu ka ṭawng ngamzie hi a nasa a, ka suongzie cheu hi a nasa a nih; thlamuongnain ka sip a, kan rinumna po poa chun hlimin ka sip liem a nih."
5,"For even when we were come into Macedonia our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.","Makedonia ram kan tlung khawm khan kan tisa chun muongna hrim a nei chuong nawh a; khing tieng khing tienga sukrinumin kan um ta lem a, puotiengah insuol- nahai a um a, sûngtiengah ṭitnahai a um a."
6,"Nevertheless he that comforteth the lowly, even God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;","Nisienlakhawm, inngaitlâwmhai thlamuongtu Pathien chun, Tita hungna chun a mi thlamuong tah a;"
7,"and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you, while he told us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced yet more.","a hungna chau chun a ni nawh a, in lunginlêngzie dâm, in ṭapzie dâm, ka chunga in ṭhahnemngaizie dâm a mi hrilin, nangnia a thlamuongna khawm chun a mi thlamuong ta a nih; chuongchun, ka lâwm nâwk zuol tah a."
8,"For though I made you sorry with my epistle, I do not regret it: though I did regret it (for I see that that epistle made you sorry, though but for a season),","Ka lekhathawn khan suklung- ngai cheu lang khawm kân sîr ta nawh a; a phut ruok khan chu kân sîr a nih, kha lekhathawn khan a suk- lungngai cheu ti ka hriet leiin; nisienlakhawm, sâwtnawtê chau a ni kha."
9,"I now rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly sort, that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing.","Tuhin chu ka lâwm a nih, suklungngaia in um lei a ni nawh a, simna dinga in lungngai leiin a ni lem a nih, keia leia iengkhawm in chân nawna dingin, Pathien dit zâwnga suklungngaiin in um sih a."
10,"For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, a repentance which bringeth no regret: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.","Pathien dit zâwng anga lung- ngaina chun, sandamna dingin, insîrna um ta lo simna chu a siem si hlak a; khawvêl lungngaina ruok chun thina a siem lem hlak."
11,"For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought in you, yea what clearing of yourselves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what longing, yea what zeal, yea what avenging! In everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.","Chuongchun, hi thil hi inchik ro: Pathien dit zâwnga suklung- ngaina chun, thil lâk ursûnna dâm, pawi tâwk ve naw in nih ti inlangtir nuomna dâm, suol theidâna le suol ṭina dâm, chuong ang ngaituona hrât tak le ṭhahnemngaina tak dam, suol thawtu chu thunun dinga inpei zingna dâm, ân neitir cheu a ni hi. Iengkimah chuong thua chun in inthieng tah ti in suklang tah a."
12,"So although I wrote unto you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest unto you in the sight of God.","Chuongchun, in kuomah ziek lang khawm a suol thawtu lei khan ka ziek nawh a, a suol tuortu lei khan ka ziek bawk nawh a, kan chunga in ṭhahnemngaizie Pathien mithmua in kuoma inhriettira a um theina dingin ka ziek lem a nih."
13,"Therefore we have been comforted: and in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all.","Chuleiin, thlamuongin kan um ta hrim a; keini thlamuongna chau naw khawm, Tita lâwmna leiin kan lâwm nasa nâwk zuol a; nangni po poin a lungril in sukhar pêk ta leiin."
14,"For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.","A kuomah ieng kawnga khawm nangni suong lang cheu khawm, ka muolpho si nawh a; muolpho nêk hmanin iengkim in kuoma thu taktaka kan hril hlak ang kha, Tita hmaa kan suong chu thu taktak a hung ni ta ngei a."
15,"And his affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.","Chun, in rênga thu in awizie dâm, ṭi le inthin puma ama in lo lâwmzie dâm chu hre zingin a lungril chu nangni tieng nasatakin ân lâwp nâwk zuol a nih."
16,I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.,Kawng tinrêngah in chunga ka muong leiin ka lâwm a nih.
