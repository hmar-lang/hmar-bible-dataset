1,"But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.","Nisienlakhawm, keia tieng thua chun hi hi ka lo tum tlat a nih, lungngai pum chun in kuoma hung ta lo dingin."
2,"For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?",Keiin ka suklungngai si cheu chun ka isuklungngai bawk naw chu tû am a mi suklâwmtu nîng a ta?
3,"And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.","Chuleichun, kha ngei kha ka ziek a nih; chuong naw chun ka hung pha ka lâwmna dinghai laia inthawkin lungngaina hmu rawi ka tih; ka lâwmna chu in rênga in lâwmna a ni ka ring pêk si cheu a."
4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.","Mitthli tamtak tla pumin, lungril rinum le thlaphângtaka ka ziek a ni kha; chu chu suklungngaia in umna ding a ni nawh a, in chunga hmangaina nasa nâwk zuol ka nei hi in hriet theina lem dingin a nih."
5,"But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.","Nisienlakhawm, tûkhawmin mi- hai a suklungngai chun, keima chau a mi suklungngai a ni nawh a; uortaka ti cheu khawm ni loin in rêngin a suklungngai met seng cheu a nih."
6,Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;,Chuong ang mi chu mi tam lemin in hrem chu a hun.
7,"so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.","Chuongchun, hrem nâwkzuol nêk hmanin in ngaidamin, in thla- muon lem ding a nih; chuong naw chun, iengamanih tiin chuong ang mi chu lungngai taluotnain lem zo rawi a tih."
8,Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him.,"Chuleichun, ama tienga in hmangaina chu sukdet zuol dingin ka ngên cheu a nih."
9,"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.",Hi lei khawm hin ka ziek a nih: kawng tinrêngah thu in awi le in awinaw kân fie theina ding cheuin.
10,"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the presence of Christ;","Ieng kawnga khawm mi in ngaidam taphawt chu, kei khawmin ka ngaidam veh a; kei khawma ka ngaidam tasa chu, iengkhawm ka ngaidam ta chun, nangni leiin Krista hmaa chun ka ngaidam tah a nih;"
11,that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.,"chuong naw chun, Setanin mi tlâkkhal rawi a tih, a zâwrna chu ei inhmei si nawh a."
12,"Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,","Chun, Krista Chanchin Ṭha hril dinga Troas ka tlung lai khan, Lalpaa chun lampui an mi hawngpêk nâka chu,"
13,"I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.","ka unaupa Tita ka hmu naw leiin ka thlarau tieng chun muongna hrim hrim ka nei chuong nawh a; chuongchun, anni chu bau ṭhain ka ṭheh a, Makedonia ramah ka fe tah a."
14,"But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.","Nisienlakhawm, Kristaa hnê- naa mi ṭhuoi rawptu le keini hmanga hmun tina ama hrietna rim inhriet- tirtu Pathien kuoma chun lâwmthu um raw se."
15,"For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;","Sandam mêkhaia le, bohmang mêkhaia chun, Pathien ta dingin Krista rim inhnik kan ni sih a,"
16,to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?,"pâwl khathai ta ding chun, thinaa inthawka thina ding rim kan lo ni a, pâwl danghai ta ding chun, hringnaa inthawka hringna ding rim kan lo nih."
17,"For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.","Chuong ang ding chun tu am tling zo an ta? Mi tamtakin Pathien thu hi mihai hlêma sumdâwngnaa an hmang angin, keini chun kan hmang ve si nawh a, titakzet lemin, Pathien itir lemin, Pathien mithmuin Kristaa chun thu kan hril lem hlak a nih."
