1,"Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you:","Chun, kei Paula, nangni laia in mithmua thuhnuoirawltaka um a, nangni laia umnaw phingleh nangni tieng zuom si hlak ngei hin, Krista zaidamna le nunnêmnain ka ngên cheu."
2,"yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.","Anih, in kuomah ka um pha, ṭhenkhat, tisa anga uma mi ruottuhai chunga huoitaka um ka tum ngamna ang hin, ka zuom nawna ding cheuin ka ngên cheu."
3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh","Tisaa, um inlang khawm tisa indo angin kan indo nawh a,"
4,"(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds);","(keini râldo inthuomna chu tisaah a ni si nawh a, kulpui dettak- hai ṭhiekna dinga Pathien zâra thil thaw thei tak a ni lem),"
5,"casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;","insêlnahai le thil insâng tinrêng Pathien hrietna hluotu dinga insângtaka siemhai chu ṭhiekin, ngaituona tinrêng Krista thuawina salah kan ṭhuoi a,"
6,"and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be made full.",in thu awizie a famkim pha chun thuawi nawna po po phuba la dingin kan inzo bawk a.
7,"Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we.","In mithmua thil umhai chu a nih in en hlak chu. Tûkhawmin Krista ta nia ân ring chun, hi hi mâkhâtin ngaituo nâwk raw se; ama chu Krista ta a ni ang bawkin keini khawm kan ni ve hi."
8,"For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame:","Kan thuneina (Nangni ṭhiekna ding ni loa nangni siem ṭhatna dinga Lalpain a mi pêk hi), suong nasa nâwk zuol lang khawm ka muolpho âwm si nawh a,"
9,that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.,ka lekhathawnhai chun sukṭit cheu tum anga kân lang nawna dingin chu chu ka ti a nih.
10,"For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.","“A lekhathawnhai chu a rikin a ngar a, a taksa tieng ruok chu a âwmnêm a, a ṭawng khawm insit a um a nih,” an ti sih a."
11,"Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.","Chuong ang mi chun hi hi ngaituo raw se, in kuoma kan um naw laia lekhathawna thua kan um angin, in kuoma kan um pha khawm thil thawah um bawk kan tih."
12,"For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.","Ṭhenkhat mâni le mâni inhril- mawihai laia chun kan intiem sa ngam nawh a, anni leh hril khawm kan inhrilkhi ngam bawk nawh; amiruokchu, anni chu mâni le mâni inkhiin, mâni le mâni inhrilkhiin lungril nei loin an um a."
13,"But we will not glory beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you.","Keini ruok chu kan inkhîna bâka chun uong naw ning ungah. Pathienin biel a mîn changtir a, chu inkhîna ang pei chun uong lem kan tih, nangni chen khawm hung biel rau dinga inkhîna chu."
14,"For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ:",Biel phâk naw sa biel cheu angin kan huop lien taluo si nawh a; Krista Chanchin Ṭha hrilin in khuo chen khawma kan hung kha;
15,"not glorying beyond our measure, that is, in other men’s labors; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto further abundance,","kan inkhina huntâwk liema, mi dang thaw sâwlhai chu, kan suong nawh a, in ringna ân ṭhang ang peiin, kan biel chin ang peiah, nangni lai nasataka suklienin um kan tih ti beiseina kan nei lem a,"
16,"so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, and not to glory in another’s province in regard of things ready to our hand.","buotsai sa kawng thua chun mi dang biel suong loin, in khêl tieng ram chen khawma Chanchin Ṭha kan hril theina dingin."
17,"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.","Nisienlakhawm, “A suong ta- phawt chun Lalpa chu suong raw se.”"
18,"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.","Mâni inhrilmawi chun inpâk a hlaw si nawh a, Lalpain a hrilmawi chun inpâk a hlaw lem hlak."
