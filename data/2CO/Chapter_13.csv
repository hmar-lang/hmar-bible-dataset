verse_no,en,hmr
1,This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word be established.,"Hi hi in kuoma ka hung a vawi thumna ding a nih. Hretuhai pahni amanih, pathum amani baua chun thu tinrêng sukdetin um a tih."
2,"I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;","Ka hril lâwk tah a, vawi hninaa in kuoma ka um laia ka hril ang khan, tuhin in kuomah um naw lang khawm, kha hmaa thil suksuoltuhai kuoma le mi po po kuomah hril lâwk nâwk ka tih. “Ka hung nâwk chun hla naw ning ah,” ti hi."
3,"seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you:","Krista keimaa thu hril hlaktu chu fiena in zawng leiin, ama chu nangni tieng a hrâtnaw nawh a, thil thawtheitak a ni lem a nih."
4,"for he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you.","Ama chu hrâtnawnaa hemdein a um a, nisienlakhawm, Pathien thilthawtheina leiin a hring ta zing a nih. Keini khawm amaa chun kan hrâtnaw a nih; nisienlakhawm, nangni tienga Pathien thilthaw- theina leiin a kuomah hring vêng kan tih."
5,"Try your own selves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know ye not as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless indeed ye be reprobate.","Ringnaa chun in um am, nangni insin hlak unla, nangni ngei infie hlak ro. Annawleh, nangniah Isu Krista chu a um ti nangni ngeiin in hriet chieng naw am a nih? dit naw in ni nghâl naw chun."
6,But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.,Keini ruok chu dit loin kan um nawh ti la hung hre dingin ka ring cheu.
7,"Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate.","Chun, thil hrim hrim in suksuol nawna dingin Pathien kuomah kan hni hlak a, chu chu keini hi dituma kan inlang theina ding a ni nawh a, nangniin a mawi mawi in thaw theina dingin a ni lem; keini chu dit naw angin um inlang khawm."
8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.","Thutak ṭan ding naw chun, thutak do ding chun iengkhawm kan thaw thei naw a nih."
9,"For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting.","Keini kan hrâtnaw lai khawma nangni in hrât hin kan lâwm hlak in sawnnaw; hi hi kan hni bawk hlak, nangni ṭhat famkimna ding hi."
10,"For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.","Chuleiin, sukse ding ni loa, siem ṭha ding lema Lalpain thuneina a mi pêk ang pei khan, in kuoma ka um pha nataka ka kâwk nawna ding cheuin in kuoma ka um naw lai hin hieng thu hi ka ziek a nih."
11,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you.","A tâwp taka chun, unauhai, lâwmtakin um ro. Sukṭhat famkim- in um unla, lungmuongtakin um unla, lungril hmunkhat put unla, lunginruoltakin um ro; chuong- chun, hmangaina le inremna Pathien chu in kuomah a um ding a nih."
12,Salute one another with a holy kiss.,Fâwp inthiengin chibai inbûk ro.
13,All the saints salute you.,Mi inthienghai po poin chibai an bûk cheu.
14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.","Lalpa Isu Krista lunginsietna dâm, Pathien hmangaina dâm, Thlarau Inthieng pâwlna dâm chu in rênga kuomah um raw se."
