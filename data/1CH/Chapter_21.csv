1,"And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.","Setan chu Israel mihai chunga chun a hung tho a, David chu Israel mihai chu ân tiemtir tah a."
2,"And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.","David chun Joab le mipuihai hotuhai kuoma chun, “Fe unla, Beer- sebaa inthawka Dan chenin Israelhai chu hung tiem unla, an ni zât ka hriet theina dingin thu mi hung intlun ro,” a ta."
3,"And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?","Joab chun, “LALPA chun a mihai chu an ni hlak zât let za khawma sukpung sienla, ka pu lal, ka pu siehlawhai an ni vawng tho a ni naw am a nih? Iengdingin am ka pu hin hieng ang thil hi a hriet nuom a ni leh? Israel ta dingin iengdingin am rîtlona bul hung ni el a ta?” a ta."
4,"Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.","Nisienlakhawm, lal thu chun Joab chu a hne tah a. Chuongchun, Joab chu a fe suok a, Israel ram po po chu a fang suok a, Jerusalemah a hung nâwk a."
5,And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.,"Chun, Joab chun mipuihai tiem- na nizât chu David kuomah a pêk tah a. Chuongchun, Israel rama mi chu kâwlhnâm chawi thei ṭhieu mi mak- taduoi khat le nuoi khat an na; Judaa chun kâwlhnâm chawi thei ṭhieu chu mi nuoi li le sîng sari an nih."
6,But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.,"Nisienlakhawm, Benjamin chi le Levi mihai chu anni lai chun a tiem sa ve nawh a; Joab ngaia chun lal thu chu theida a um vieu si leiin."
7,And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.,"Chun, hi thila hin Pathien chu a lâwm ta naw hle el a; chuleiin, Israel ram chu a hung hrem tah a."
8,"And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.","Chun, David chun Pathien kuom- ah, “Hi thil ka lo thaw taa hin, nasa- takin thil ka suksuol a nih; amiruok- chu, tuhin ka ngên che, i siehlaw khawhlona hi ngaidam rawh; invêt thlâktakin ka lo thaw ta sih a,” a ta."
9,"And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,","Chun, LALPA chun David zâwl- nei Gad kuoma chun, “Fe la, David kuoma chun hieng hin va hril rawh."
10,"Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.","LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: ‘Thil pathum ka ruotpêk cheh a, hi laia pakhat hi thlang rawh, i ta dinga ka thawpêk theina ding chein,’ tiin,” a ta."
11,"So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:","Chuongchun, Gad chu David kuoma chun a feh a, a kuoma chun, “LALPA chun hieng hin a tih; i dittak thlang rawh;"
12,"either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.","kum thum sûng ṭâm amanih; i hmêlmahai kâwlhnâmin a hnawt phâk pha cheh a, ihmêlmahai hmaa thla thum sûng sukbohmanga um amanih; annawleh, Israel ram sûng po poa LALPA vântirkoin hung sukse a, ram sûnga hri hung inlêng a, LALPA kâwlhnâm chu ni thum sûng tuor chu. Tuhin ngaituo la, ieng dawnna am a mi tirtu kuoma chun kân kîr nâwk ding a na,” a ta."
13,"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.","Chun, David chun Gad kuoma chun, “Nasatakin ka lunginzîng a,LALPA kutah a tlûkin tlulût phawt el ka tih; a zângaina chu a nasa sih a, chuleiin, mihriem kuta chun mîn tlûktir êm naw nih,” a ta."
14,So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.,"Chuongchun, LALPA chun Israel chunga chun hri a tir tah a, Israel mihai chu sîng sari an thi a."
15,"And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Chun, Pathien chun sukse dingin Jerusalema chun vântirko a tir a; chuonga a suksiet ding lai tak chun LALPA chun a hmuh a, thil ṭha naw thaw a tum chu ân kîr a; chuongchun, a suksetu ding vântirko kuoma chun, “A hun tah, i kut tuhin chel hri rawh,” a ta. Chun, vântirko chu Jebus mi Ornan hrizâwla chun a ngîr ta zing a."
16,"And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.","Chun, David chu a hung dâk suok a, LALPA vântirko hnuoi le vân kâra ngîr chu a hang hmu tah a; a kâwlhnâm phawi sain, Jerusalem tienga bân pharin a hmuh a. Chun, David le upahai chu saiip puon an sil a, an hmaia hnuoi sikin an bawk tâwl tah a."
17,"And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.","Chun, David chun Pathien kuoma chun, “Mipuihai chu tiem dinga thu pe kha kei ka ni naw am a nih? Khawhlotaka thawa, lo suk- suol ta kha kei ngei ka nih; ami- ruokchu, hieng berâm ruolhai hin ieng am an thawh a? Aw LALPA ka Pathien, ka hni che, i kut chu ka chunga le ka thlatuhai sûngkaw chunga hin tla sienla; i mihai chung- ah ni loin, hri tuora an um nawna dingin,” a ta."
18,"Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Chun, LALPA vântirko chun, Jebus mi Ornan hrizâwla chun LALPA ta dinga mâichâm hang bâwl dingin David chu fe dingin, David kuoma hril dingin Gad chu thu a pêk tah a."
19,"And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah.","Chun, Gad hril ang chun, LALPA hminga a hril ang ngei chun David chu a hang fe tah a."
20,"And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.","Chun, Ornan chu a hei ngha kîr chun vântirko chu a hmuh a, a naupasalhai pali ama le umhai ruok chu an inbi a. Ornan chun bu a chîl lai a na."
21,"And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.","Chun, David chun Ornan a hung pan chun Ornan chun a hei en a, David chu a hmu a, hrizâwla inthawk chu a hung suok a, a hmaia hnuoi sikin David hmaa chun a kûn tah a."
22,"Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.","Chun, David chun Ornan kuom- a chun, “LALPA ta dinga mâichâm ka siem theina dingin hi hrizâwl hmun hi mi pe rawh; a man huntâwk zet angin mi pêng i ta; mipuihaia inthawka hri ân kieng theina dingin,” a ta."
23,"And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.","Chun, Ornan chun David kuom- ah, “Nangmân la el rawh, ka pu lal hin a ngai a ṭha a ti ang peiin thaw el raw se; en ta, hi bâwngchal pumraw- hmang thilinhlâna dingin ka pêk cheh a, bu vuokna thuomhnawhai hi a thing dingin, chun, bu hi bu thilinhlân dingin; a rêngin ka pêk vawng che a nih,” a ta."
24,"And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.","Chun, lal David chun Ornan kuoma chun, “Ni lo e a, a man kim chie ang takin kân châwk ding annâwm; nangma ta chu LALPA ta dingin ka lâkpêk ding che a ni nawh a, chun, pumrawhmang thilinhlân khawm chu man bo chun kân hlân ding a ni nawh,” a ta."
25,So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.,"Chuongchun, David chun Ornan kuoma chun rângkachak a bûk a, shekel za ruk a hmun man ding chun a pêk tah a."
26,"And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.","Chun, Davidin chutaka chun mâichâm chu LALPA ta dingin a siem a, pumrawhmang thilinhlân le, in- remna thilinhlân chu ân hlân a, LALPA chu a ko tah a; chun, ama chun vâna inthawk chun pumraw- hmangna mâichâm chungah meiin a zuk dawn tah a."
27,And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.,"Chun, LALPA chun vântirko chu thu a pêk a; a kâwlhnâm chu a bâwma chun a khum nâwk tah a."
28,"At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.","Chu huna chun, Jebus mi Ornan hrizâwla chun LALPA chun a zuk dawn ti a hmu phing chun chutaka chun ân thâwi tah a."
29,"For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.","LALPA biekbûk thlalêra Mosien a siem le, pumrawhmang thilin- hlânna mâichâm chu, chu huna chun Gibeona bâwlhmuna chun a la um zing sih a."
30,But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.,"Nisienlakhawm, chu hmaa chun Pathien rawn dingin David chu a fe thei nawh a,LALPA vântirko kâwlhnâm lei chun a ṭi tlat sih a."
