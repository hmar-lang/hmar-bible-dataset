1,Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.,"David chu a hung tar tah a, a hung upa ta hle a, a naupa Solomon chu Israel chunga lal dingin a siem tah a."
2,"And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.","Chun, Israel upahai po po le thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu a ko khâwm vawng a."
3,"And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.","Levi mihai chu kum sâwmthum chung tienga po chu tiem an na; an tiem dânbi ang chun an nizât chu, patling sîng thum le sâng riet an nih."
4,"Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges;",Hi laia mi sîng hni le za li hin LALPA in sin chu an enkawl ding a na;
5,"and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.","chun, sâng ruk dang chu hotuhai le rorêltuhai an nih; sâng li chu kawtkhâr vêngtuhai an na; sâng li dang chun, “Inpâkna dinga ka siem,” Davidin a ti, chuong thuomhnawhai le chun LALPA chu inpâk ding an nih."
6,"And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.","David chun anni chu a pâwl peiin, Levi naupasalhai ang peiin a ṭheh a; Gerson le Kohath le Merari hai hi."
7,Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.,Gerson mia chun Ladan le Simei an na.

9,"The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ houses of Ladan.","Simei naupasalhai chu: Selo- moth, Haziel le Haran, hi pathum hi. Hienghai hi Ladan sûngkuo pahnam luhai chu an nih."
10,"And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.","Chun, Simei naupasalhai chu: Jahath, Zina, Jeus le Beria an nih. Hieng palihai hi Simei naupasalhai an nih."
11,"And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.","Chun, Jahath chu a hotu tak a na, Ziza chu a pahnina; amiruokchu, Jeus le Beria chun naupasal tamtak an nei nawh a; chuleiin, tiem dânah thlâ khat an nih."
12,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.","Kohath naupasalhai chu: Amram, Izhar, Hebron le Uzziel, hi pali hi."
13,"The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, for ever.","Amram naupasalhai chu: Aron le Mosie; chu, Aron le a naupasalhai chu ama le a nauhai chun thil inthienghai chu hlânthieng a, kum- khuoa LALPA hmaa riminhnik raw ding le, ama rawngbâwl ding le, ama hminga malsâwm kumkhuo dinga suktum an nih."
14,"But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien mi Mosie chu, a naupasalhai chu Levi hnam laia lam sa a na."

23,"The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.","Musi naupasalhai chu: Mahli leh, Eder leh, Jeremoth leh, pathum."
24,"These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward.","Hienghai hi an pahnam anga Levi naupasalhai chu an nih, tiemna laia an pahnamhai luhai chu an na, LALPA ina rawngbâwlnaa sinthaw- tuhai, tiem an ni dânbi anga hming suota nizât, kum sâwmhnia in- thawka chungtieng an nih."
25,"For David said, Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath given rest unto his people; and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever:","David chun, “LALPA Israelhai Pathien chun a mihai chu muongna a pêk a;"
26,and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.,"chun, Levi mihai khawm chun a biekbûk le chutaka a rawngbâwlna bûr le bêlhai po po chu an zâwn a ṭûl bawk ta nawh a,” a ti sih a."
27,"For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.","David thu nuhnung tak ang- in, Levi thlahai chu, kum sâwm- hni le a chungtienga po chu tiem an na."
28,"For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;","An sinthaw chu Pathien ina rawngbâwlna sinhai: thil inthieng po pohai sukthieng dâm, pindanahai le inhuonna tuol sûnga LALPA Ina rawngbâwlnaa chun Aron naupa- salhai chu an ṭhangpui ding a ni sih a;"
29,"for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;","entirna bei ta ding dâm, bu thilinhlân dinga beiphit inditaka ding, chawl ṭhanglo bei amanih, bêl dara zêu amanih, a suonga suong amanih, ieng anga lien le ieng ang tiet ding khawmin;"
30,"and to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even;","zîng tina Pathien inpâk dinga ngîr dingin, chuong ang bawkin zântieng khawm;"
31,"and to offer all burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Jehovah;","châwlnihai dâm, thlatharhai dâm, ruoiṭhena bi ruotahai dâma LALPA hmaa chuong chungthua thaw rawp a ni ding dân ang peia LALPA kuoma pumrawhmang thilin- hlân chu inhlân ding dâmin;"
32,"and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of Jehovah.","chun, LALPA ina rawngbâwlna dinga, an unau Aron thlahai sin kawl le, hmun inthieng enkawlna sin le, intuokna in enkawlna sin chu an kawl ding a nih;"
