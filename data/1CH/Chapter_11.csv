1,"Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.","Chun, Israelhai po po chu David kuomah Hebrona chun an hung inkhâwm a, “Ngai ta, i ru le i tisahai kan ni hi."
2,"In times past, even when Saul was king, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my people Israel.","Kha hmaa Saula lal a ni lai khawm khan, nangin i mi keihruoi a, Israel rama hin i mi hung lûtpui a na, LALPA i Pathien chun i kuomah, ‘Ka mi Israelhai chu châwm i ta, ka mi Israelhai chunga chun lal nîng i tih,’ a ti kha,” an ta."
3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel.","Chuongchun, Israel upahai po po chu Hebronah lal kuoma chun an hung a, David chun LALPA hmaah Hebrona chun anni le chun thuthlung a siem tah a; Samuel kuta LALPA thu ang peiin David chu Israel lal ni dingin hriek an nâl tah a."
4,"And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.","Chun, David le Israel mihai po po chu Jerusalemah an hang feh a (chu chu Jebus a nih); chun, Jebus mihai, a rama chênghai chu chutaka chun an um a."
5,"And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.","Jebusa chênghai chun David kuomah, “Hitaka hin i hung lût ding a ni nawh,” an lo tih a. Nisienla- khawm, David chun Zion kul chu a lâk a; chu chu David khawpui a hung ni tah a."
6,"And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.","David chun, “Tukhawm Jebus mi that hmasataktu chu sipai hotu tak nîng a tih,” a ta. Chun, Zeruia naupa Joab chu a hmasatak a na, chuong- chun, hotua siem a ni tah a."
7,And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.,"Chun, David chu kula chun a chêng tah a; chuleichun, David khaw- pui an ti tah a."
8,"And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.","Chun, khawpui chu Millo le a vêl po po chu a vêlin a bâwl a; chun, Joab chun a la bâkhai chu a siemṭha bawk a."
9,And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah of hosts was with him.,"Chun, David chu a hung ropui deu deu a, sipaihai LALPA chu a kuomah a um sih a."
10,"Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.","Chun, hienghai hi sipai huoisen bîkhai Davidin a nei, Israel chung- thua LALPA thu ang peia ama lala siem dinga Israel mihai po po inkawpa, a ram sûnga ama le hrâta insuklanghai chu an nih."
11,"And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.","Hieng hi mi thilthawthei David- in a nei chu an nih: Hakmon thlaa mi Jasobeam, sâwmthum chunga hotu; mi za thum chungah a fei ân let a, kâr loin anni chu a that tâwl tah a."
12,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.","Chun, ama hnunga chun Aho mi, Dodo naupa Eleazar, mi thilthaw- thei pathumhai laia pakhat chu a nih."
13,"He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.","Pasdammima khan David kuomah a um a, chu hmuna chun Philistin mihai chu indo dingin an inkhâwm a, chutaka chun, hmun, buṭeia sip a um a; mipuihai chu Philistin mihai hmaa chun an tlân- seh a."
14,"And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a great victory.","Chun, chu bu hmun lailung laia chun an ngîr a, an hum tlat tah a; Philistin mihai chu an that a, LALPA chun hnena ropuitakin anni chu a sanhim a."
15,"And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.","Chun, sipai sâwmthumhai chu lungpuiah, David kuomah, Adullam pûka chun an va feh a; chun, Philistin sipaihai chu Rephaim ruoma chun ruongchaichea thlâkin an um a."
16,"And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.","Chun, David chu kula chun a um a; Philistin sipai ruol chu chu lai chun Bethlehema chun an um a."
17,"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!","Chun, David chun a châk a, “Kul kawtkhâr bula Bethlehem tui- sunsuo tui kha dâwn dingin mi pe um hai sien chu aw!” a ta."
18,"And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah,","Chuongchun, mi pathumhai chun Philistin sipaihai chu an nêr- thleng a, kul kawtkhâr bula Beth- lehema tuisunsuoa inthawk chun tui chu an va chawi a, an hung lâk a, David kuomah an hung lâk tah a: nisienlakhawm, David chun tui chu a dawn nawh a, LALPA kuomah a bunthlâk ta lem a."
19,"and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.","“Hi hi ka thaw ding hi ka Pathien chun mi khap raw se: an hringna ṭiumtaka sietuhai, hieng mihai hringna thisen hi ka dâwn ding am a nih? An hringna chân huoma hi hi an hung lâk a ni sih a,” a ta. Chuleichun, a dâwn ta nawh a. Hieng thil hi mi thilthawthei pathumhai chun an thaw a nih."
20,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.","Chun, Joab unaupa Abisai chu sâwmthumhai laia hotu tak a na, ama chun za thumhai chunga chun a fei chu a phawi a, anni chu a that a, pathumhai laia chun hming ṭhat a hlawh a."
21,"Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.","Sâwmthumhai lai chun ama chu inza a kai a; chuongchun, anni chunga hotua siem chu a ni tah a; nisienlakhawm, a hmaa pathumhai lai chu a ṭhang nawh."
22,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.","Kabzeel mi, mi thilthawtheitak naupa, Jehoiada naupa Benaia, thil nasatakhai thawtu chu a nih: Moaba Ariel naupasal pahnihai chu a that a, a fe thla a, vûr tlâk hun laiin pûk sûnga chun sakeibaknei a that bawk a."
23,"And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.","Chun, Aigupta mi, mi taksa lientak tawng ngaa insâng a that a; chu Aigupta mi kuta chun puon khâwngtu puonkawl ang hi fei a um a; ama chun hmawl leh a pan thlâk a, Aigupta mi kuta fei chu a lâkpêk a, ama fei ngei chun a that tah a."
24,"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.","Jehoiada naupa Benaia chun hieng thilhai hi a thawh a, mi thil- thawthei pathumhai laia chun hming ṭhat a hlaw tah a."
25,"Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.","Ngai ta, ama chu mi sâwm- thumhai nêk khan nasatakin inza a kai a, amiruokchu, a hmasatak pa- thumhai lai chu a ṭhang nawh: David chun ama vêngtu pâwl hotua chun a siem a."
26,"Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,","Chun, sipai pâwlhai laia mi thil- thawtheihai chu: Joab unaupa Asahel, Bethlehema Dodo naupa Elhanan."
