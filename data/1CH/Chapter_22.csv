Kil tin ela chun muongna a pêk cheu a ni naw am a nih? A ram hluotuhai chu ka kutah a hung pêk tâwl ta sih a; chun, a ram khawm chu LALPA le a mihai hmaa chun an intuklût ta sih a."
19,"Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Jehovah.","Tuhin, LALPA in Pathien chu zawng dingin in lungril le in lungvar chu ama tieng ngha unla, tho unla, chuongchun, LALPA Pathien hmun inthieng; LALPA thuthlungna bâwm le, Pathien bûr le bêl inthienghai chu hung lâkna dingin, LALPA hmingin in bâwl ro,” tiin."
