1,"And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.","Hi hnunga hin hieng hi a hung na; Ammon thlahai lal Nahas chu a thih a, ama aia chun a naupa chun ro a rêl tah a."
2,"And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.","Chun, David chun, “A pa khan ka chungah lunginsietna ân entir leiin, Nahas naupa Hanun chunga hin lunginsietna inentir vêng ka tih,” a ta. Chuongchun, a pa chungthua chun, ama thlamuon dingin David chun mi a tir a. David siehlawhai chu ama thlamuon dingin Hanun kuoma chun Ammon thlahai rama chun an hung tah a."
3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?","Amiruokchu, Ammon thlahai laia an hotuhai chun Hanun kuoma chun, “David chun i pa chu ân za leiin i kuomah thlamuontuhai a hung tir ni dingin i ring am a nih? Hieng a siehlawhai hi thil zawng suok ding le, hre ding le ram chu enthlit dinga i kuoma hung an ni lem a ni naw maw?” an ta."
4,"So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.","Chuongchun, Hanun chun David siehlawhai chu a man a, an hmul a vâwpêk a, an silfênhai chu a laiah, a mawng tlung rakin a thlêrpêk a, anni chu a tir hmang tah a."
5,"Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.","Chun, mi tu amanih David kuoma chun a va feh a, mihai an lo sawisak dân chu a va hril tah a. Ama chun anni chu tuok dingin mi a tir a; mihai chu nasatakin an inzak sih a. Chun, lal chun, “In khâkhmulhai ân ṭhang sei hmakhat chu Jerikoah um phawt el ro, chun, hung chau ro,” a tih a."
6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chu David ta dingin theidaumin an insiem tah ti an hriet phing chun Hanun le Ammon thlahai chun, Zobaa inthawk dâm, Aram-maakaa inthawk dâm, Meso- potamiaa inthawk dâma sakawr puhai le sakawr tawlailîrhai hawna dingin tangkaruo talent sâng khat an thawn tah a."
7,"So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.","Chuongchun, sakawr tawlailîr sîng thum le sâng hni chu, Maaka lal le a mihai le chun an ruoi tah a; anni chu an hung a, Medeba phâk hmaa chun an inkul tah a. Chuongchun, Ammon thlahai chu an khawpuihaia inthawk chun an hung pungkhâwm a, indo dingin an suok tah a."
8,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.","Davidin chu chu a hriet chun, Joab le mi thilthawthei sipai pâwl po po chu a tir tah a."
9,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chu an hung suok a, khawpui dai kawtkhâra chun an intlar a; chun, lalhai a hung ṭhangvehai khawm chu an khâtin phûla chun an um a."
10,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.","Joab chun indona chu hnung- tieng le hmatienga chun an hung nawr a nih ti a hmu chun, Israel laia mi ditumhai chu a thlangsuok a, Suria mihai hmaa chun ân tlartir tah a."
11,And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.,"Mi dang po po chu a unaupa Abisai kuta chun ân kawltir a, Ammon thlahai epa chun an intlar ve tah a."
12,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.","Ama chun, “Suria mihai chu ka ta dinga an hung hrât talaw chun, mi ṭhangpui i ta; chun, Ammon thlahai chu nanga ta dinga an hung hrât talaw bawk chun, keiin ṭhangpui thung ka ti cheh a."
13,"Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.","Insukhuoi unla, ei hnam le ei Pathien khawpuihai sanin insuk- pasal ei tiu: chun, Pathien chun ṭha a ti ang peiin thaw raw se,” a ta."
14,So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.,"Chuongchun, Joab le a kuoma mi umhai chun Suria mihai chu indo dingin an va hnai tah a; chuongchun, ama hmaa chun an tlânse tah a."
15,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.","Chun, Ammon thlahai chun Suria mihai chu an tlânsie ti an hriet phing chun, anni khawm chuong ang bawk chun a unaupa Abisai hmaa inthawk chun an tlânse ve tah a, khawpuia chun an lût tah a, Joab ruok chu Jerusalema chun a kîr nâwk tah a."
16,"And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.","Chun, Suria mihaiin Israelhai hmaa chun se nâwk zuol an ni tah ti an hriet chun mi an tir a, Vadungpui râla Suria mi umhai chu, Hadarezer sipaihai hotu Sophak rawiin an incha suok tah a."
17,"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.","Chu chu David kuoma chun an hril a; chun, ama chun Israel mihai po po chu a kei khâwm a, Jordan râl an hung kai a, anni chu an hmuh a, thaw dingin an inzar tah a."
18,"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.","Chun, Israelhai hmaa chun Suria mihai chu an tlânseh a; chuong- chun, David chun sakawr tawlailîr sîng sari puhai le, kea fe mi sîng li Suria mi chu a that tah a; chun, Sophak sipaihotu khawm chu a that tah a."
19,"And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.","Chun, Hadarezer siehlawhaiin Israelhai hmaa chun an chan a se nâwk zuol an tah ti an hriet chun David le chun inremna an siem a, ama rawng chu an bâwl tah a; Suria mihai khawm chun Ammon thlahai chu an ṭhangpui ngai ta hrim hrim nawh a."
