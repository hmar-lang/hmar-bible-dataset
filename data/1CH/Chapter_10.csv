1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Israelhai chu an hung do a, chuongchun, Israel mihai chu Philis- tin mihai hmaa inthawk chun an tlânsieh a, Gilboa tlânga dâm chun anni chu thatin an tlu tâwl a."
2,"And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.","Chun, Philistin mihai chun Saula le a naupasalhai chu nasatakin an hnawt a; chuongchun, Philistin mi- hai chun Saula naupasal Jonathan le Abinadab le Malkisua chu anthat a."
3,"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.","Chun, Saula chunga chun indona chu a hung zuol ta hle el a, thal kâp mihai chun ama chu an nangchîng tah a; thal kâp mihai lei chun nasatakin a beidawng tah a."
4,"Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.","Chun, Saula chun a râlthuom chawitu kuoma chun, “I kâwlhnâm kha phawi la, mi hung sunthleng el rawh; chuong naw chun, hieng sertan lohai hi hung an ta, mi hung sukbuoi rawi an tih,” a ta. Nisienlakhawm, a râlthuom chawitu chu a nuom nawh a, ama chu a ṭi êm êm leiin. Chuleiin, Saula chun a kâwlhnâm chu a lâk a, a baw lût tah a."
5,"And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died.","Chun, a râlthuom chawitu chun Saula chu a thi tah ti a hmu chun, ama khawm chu a kâwlhnâm chu a baw lût a, a thi ve tah a."
6,"So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together.","Chuongchun, Saula chu a thi tah a, a naupasal pathumhai leh; an sûngkuo chu an rêngin hmunkhata chun an thi tah a."
7,"And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.","Chun, ruoma um Israel mihai po po chu an tlânseh a, Saula le a naupa- salhai chu an thi ti an hriet phing chun an khuohai chu an tlânsan a, an tlânse ve tah a; chuongchun, Philistin mihai chu an hung a, chuongahai chun an hung chêng tah a."
8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.","Chun, a zînga Philistin mihaiin an râl thathai thuom chu hlîp dinga an hung chun Saula le a naupasalhai chu Gilboa tlânga chun an lo tlu ve zing ti an hmu tah a."
9,"And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto their idols, and to the people.","Ama chu a thuom an hlîp a, a lu chu an lâk a, a râlthuom leh, mipuihai le an milimhai kuoma chanchin intlun dingin Philistin rama chun an thawn vêl tah a."
10,"And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.","Chuongchun, a râlthuomhai chu an pathienhai ina chun an sieh a, a lu chu Dagon ina chun an târ a."
11,"And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,","Chun, Jabes-gilead mihai po po chun Saula chunga Philistin mihai thilthaw po po chu an hrietin,"
12,"all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.","mi hrât huoisenhai po po chu an tho a, Saula ruong le a naupasalhai ruonghai chu an lâk hmang a, Jabes-a chun an hung lâk a, Jabes- a thingsaisuo hnuoiah an ruhai chu an phûm a, ni sari sûng bu an nghei a."
13,"So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he kept not; and also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire thereby,","Chuongchun, Saula chu LALPA chunga a ringum nawna leiin a thi tah a; LALPA thu chu a zâwm nawh a, khawhri zâwl aisânthiem chu zawng suokin a râwn a,"
14,"and inquired not of Jehovah: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.","LALPA chu a râwn naw a nih. Chuongchun, LALPA chun ama chu a sukhlum a, a ram chu Jesai naupa David kuoma pêk a ni tah."
