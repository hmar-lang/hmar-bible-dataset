1,"And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that served the king by course, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, unto Jerusalem.","Lal David chun Israel lal po pohai, hnam tina luhai, a pâwl pâwla lal sinthawtuhai hotuhai, sipai sâng khat pâwl chunga hotuhai, za khat pâwl chunga hotuhai, a naupa- salhai le lal thilnei le thuomhnaw po po chunga rorêltuhai le, mi lienhai le, mi huoisen, mi hrât khawkhênghai po po chu Jerusalema chun a ko khâwm vawng a."
2,"Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: as for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the building.","Chun, lal David chu a kein a ngîr a, “Ka unauhai, ka mihai, lo ngai ta u; keia ngaia chun LALPA thuthlungna bâwm châwlna ding in le, Pathien ke innghatna ding hmun bâwlpêk chu ka lungrilah a um a; chuongchun, a in bâwlna ding khawm chu ka siem zo hieu tah a."
3,"But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.","Nisienlakhawm, Pathien chun, ‘Nang chun ka in bâwl naw ti nih, indo mi i na, thisen însuo hlak leiin,’ a ta."
4,"Howbeit Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;","Ngai ta u, LALPA Israel Pathien chun kumkhuoa Israelhai chunga lala um dingin ka thlatuhai thla laia inthawk chun a mi thlang suok a; ka thlatu sûngkuoah, Juda sûngkuoa chun, Juda chu hotu ni dingin a thlang ta sih a; chuongchun, ka pa naupasalhai laia chun Israel po po chunga lala mi siem chu ṭha a ti zâwng tak a ni tah a;"
5,"and of all my sons (for Jehovah hath given me many sons), he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.","chun, ka naupasalhai po laiah (LALPA chun naupasal tamtak a mi pêk sih a), Israel chunga LALPA rama lalṭhungphaa ṭhung dingin ka naupa Solomon chu a thlang tah a."
6,"And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.","Chun, ka kuomah a hril a, ‘I naupa Solomon hin ka in le ka tuollai sûng chu bâwl a tih, ama chu ka naupa ni dingin ka thlang tah a, kei khawm a pa nîng ka tih."
7,"And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day.","Chun, a ram khawm chu kum- khawtluongin sukdet ka tih, tulai hun anga ka rorêlhai le ka thupêkhai thaw dinga a pawm zing chun,’ tiin."
8,"Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever.","“Chuleiin, tuhin, LALPA mipui inkhâwm Israelhai mithmua le ei Pathien hrietna hin, hi ram ṭhatak hi in nei thei a, kumkhuoa dinga in thlahai kuoma rochan ni dinga in mâksanpêk theina dingin LALPA in Pathien thupêkhai po po chu zawng suok unla, zâwm ro."
9,"And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.","Chun, nang ka naupa Solomon, i thlatuhai Pathien chu hre la, lungril inhâwktak le lungril tlûntakin ama rawng chu bâwl rawh; LALPA chun lungril sûng po po chu a zawng suok hlak a, lungrila tumhai khawm chu a hriet hlak sih a; ama chu i zawng chun, i hmuah um ngei a ta; amiruok- chu, ama chu i nghatsan chun, ama khawmin kumkhuoa dingin pei thla vêng a ti che."
10,"Take heed now; for Jehovah hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.","Tuhin fîmkhur la; hmun in- thieng ta dinga in bâwl dingin LALPA chun a ruot ta si cheh a; insukhrât la thaw nghâl rawh,” tiin."
11,"Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper rooms thereof, and of the inner chambers thereof, and of the place of the mercy-seat;","Chun, David chun a naupa Solomon kuoma chun biek in tuolpûk lim le chutaka a in le, a sum sie- khâwmna in le, chutaka a pindan chunghnunghai le, a pindan sûngril- hai le, zângaina ṭhungpha hmun dinghai lim chu a pêk a;"
12,"and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;","a lungrila a lo hmu ta ang chun: LALPA in tuolsûng tuollai inhuonna dâm, a vêl pindan po po lim dâm, Pathien ina sum siekhâwmna in lim dâm, thilser siekhâwmna in lim dâm chu a pêk a;"
13,"also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah;","thiempuhai le Levi mihai a pâwl pâwla an umna ding hmun lim dâm, Lalpa ina dinga bûr le bêl po po hai lim dâm,"
14,"of gold by weight for the vessels of gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; of silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;","rawngbâwlna ding bûr le bêl chi tin, rângkachak bûr le bêl ding, rângkachak hmang zât ding,"
15,"by weight also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof; and for the candlesticks of silver, silver by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick;","rângkachak khâwnvar siena le a khâwnvar ding rângkachak hmang zât ding le, a sathâu khâwnvar siena le chutaka a khâwnvar ta ding chun rângkachak a bûka bûkin a pêk a; tangkaruo khawm tangkaraw sathâu khâwnvar siena dingin le a khâwnvar siena tin bûkzie ang pei chun a pêk a;"
16,"and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;","chun, entirna bei siena dinga dawkân dingin rângkachak, dawkân tin ta dingin; chun, tangkaraw daw- kân ta dingin tangkaruo;"
17,"and the flesh-hooks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;","sa kuoikimhai le, châwtawlhai le nohai chu, rângkachak inthieng: rângkachak maihûn ding chun mai- hûn tin chu a bûk ang peiin, tang- karaw maihûn ding chun maihûn tin a bûk ang peiin;"
18,"and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, even the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.","chun, riminhnik râwna mâi- châma ding chun rângkachak suk- thieng a bûka bûkin, chun, cherubhai LALPA thuthlungna bâwm an thlahai zâra inkhumtuhai tawlailîr lima dinga chun rângkachak a pêk bawk a."
19,"All this, said David, have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the works of this pattern.","David chun, “Hieng po po hi LALPA chun keima chungah ama kut ngeia ziekin a mîn hriettir a nih, hi riruongna sin po pohai hi,” a tih a."
20,"And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for Jehovah God, even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah be finished.","Chun, David chun a naupa Solomon kuoma chun, “Insukhrât la, insukhuoi la, thaw el rawh; ṭi naw la, beidawng bawk naw rawh; LALPA Pathien, ka Pathien ngei chu i kuomah a um sih a; LALPA ina rawngbâwlna sin po pohai chu zo a ni vawng hmakhat chun inhlawsamtir naw ni cheh a, nghatsan bawk naw ni che."
21,"And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.","Chun, ngai ta, Pathien ina rawngbâwlna po poa dingin Levi mihai le thiempuhai chu pâwl an um a; sin kawng chi tinrênga ding chun mi themthiem inhâwktak takhai i kuomah um an ta, rawngbâwlna kawng tinrênga ding chun; mipuihai hotuhai po po khawm chu i thu thuin an um ding a nih,” a ta."
