1,"And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.",David chun sâng chunga hotu- hai le za chunga hotuhai le ṭhuoitu tinrênghai chu ân râwnpui a.
2,"And David said unto all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let us send abroad every where unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us;","Chuongchun, David chun Israel mi hung inkhâwmhai po po kuom- a chun, “Ṭha in ti zâwng a na, LALPA ei Pathien ṭha ti zâwng a ni chun, Israel ram po poa ei unauhai mâksan la umhai kha, an khaw- puihai khawper neihaia thiempuhai le Levi mihai umnaa umhai kha, ei kuoma an hung khâwm theina dingin inchâng ei ta,"
3,and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.,"ei kuomah ei Pathien bâwm kha hang la nâwk tâng ei tiu; Saula hun lai chena kha ei ngaisak ta dêr naw a ni sih a,” a ta."
4,And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.,"Chuongchun, mipui pung- khâwmhai po po chun thaw ding an ti tah a; chu thil chu mipui ngaia chun ân dik sih a."
5,"So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.","Chuongchun, David chun Ai- gupta vadung Sihora inthawkin Hamath lûtna chena mi chu Kiriath- jearima inthawka Pathien bâwm chu hang la dingin Israel mi po pohai chu a khâwm tah a."
6,"And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God Jehovah that sitteth above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.","Chuongchun, David le Israel mi po po chu Baala-ah, chu chu Juda rama Kiriath-jearim a nih, Pathien bâwm, cherubhai inkâra LALPA chu chênga a hming an kona hlak chu hang la dingin an hang fe tah a."
7,"And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.","Chun, Pathien bâwm chu taw- lailîr thar chungah an phur a; Abinadab ina inthawk chun an hung lâk suok a; Uzza le Ahio chun taw- lailîr chu an khal a."
8,"And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.","Chun, David le Israel mi po pohai chu Pathien hmaa chun, hlahai le, ṭingṭanghai le, perkhuonghai le, khuongtêhai le, dârbenthekhai le tawtawrâwthai mûtin an um a."
9,"And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.","Chun, Kidon hrizâwl an hung tlung chun; bâwngchalhai chu an insui leiin bâwm chu chel dingin Uzza chun a kutin a hei ban a."
10,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.","Chuongchun, LALPA lungin- sen chu Uzza chunga chun a hung chawk a, bâwm chu a kuta a hei ban lei chun ama chu a sukhlum tah a; chutaka chun Pathien hmaah a thi tah a."
11,"And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzza: and he called that place Perez-uzza, unto this day.","Chun, Uzza chunga LALPA chun a kut a thlâk lei chun David chu a lungawi naw hleh a, chu hmun chu Perez-uzza ân bûk a, tu chen hin ti a nih."
12,"And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?","Chun, chu ni chun David chun Pathien chu a ṭi tah a, “Iengtin am ka inah ka kuomah Pathien bâwm hi hung la thei tâng ka ta?” a ta."
13,"So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.","Chuongchun, David chun bâwm chu David khuoah ama kuoma chun a sawn ta nawh a, amiruokchu, Git mi Obed-edom ina chun a lâk lût lem tah a."
14,"And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.","Chun, Pathien bâwm chu Obed- edom sûngkuo lai, a ina chun thla thum lai a um tah a; chuongchun, Pathienin Obed-edom in sûng le a nei po po chu mal a sâwmpêk a."
