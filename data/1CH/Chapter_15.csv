12,"and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it.","an kuomah, “Levi mihai pa- hnam laia hotuhai in na, a hmun dinga ka buotsai tah hmuna LALPA Israelhai Pathien bâwm chu in hung lâk theina dingin insukthieng unla, nangni le in unauhai leh."
13,"For because ye bare it not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance.","A hmasa khawm khan nang- niin in phur naw leiin LALPA ei Pathien chun a mi lo sukṭhul tah a; thupêk angtaka ei lo thaw naw leiin,” a ta."
14,"So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.","Chuongchun, thiempuhai le Levi mihai chu LALPA Israelhai Pathien bâwm chu zu la dingin an insukthieng tah a."
15,"And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Jehovah.","Chuongchun, Levi thlahai chun Pathien bâwm chu LALPA thu ang taka Mosie thupêk angin zâwnfung- haiin an liengkoin an zâwn a."
16,"And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.","David chun Levi mihai an hotu tak kuoma chun an unauhai chu thilrimawihai, perkhuonghai, ṭing- ṭanghai, dârbenthekhai le hlim râwla khêk rak rak a, sut dingin hlasak- tuhai ruot dingin a hril a."
17,"So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;","Chuongchun, Levi mihai chu Joel naupa Heman; a unauhai Berekia naupa Asaph le an unau Merari naupasalhai laia mi chu an ruot a, Kusaia naupa Ethan hai dâm;"
18,"and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.","chun, anni laia an unauhai ân hnuoi pâwla chun Zekaria, Benaia, Jaaziel, Semiramoth; Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaia, Maaseia, Mattithia, Eliphelehu, Mikneia hai; chun, Obed- edom le Jeiel, kawtkhâr vêngtuhai chu an ruot bawk a."
19,"So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed, with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;","Chuongchun, hlasaktuhai He- man, Asaph le Ethan, hai hi dâr dârbenthek inringtaka sut dinga ruot an na;"
20,"and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth;","chun, Zekaria, Aziel, Semira- moth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseia, Benaia hai chu Alamoth biha sut dinga perkhuong pua ruot an na;"
21,"and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead.","chun, Mattithia, Eliphelehu, Mikneia, Obed-edom, Jeiel le Azazia hai hi ṭingṭang Seminith biha per dinga ruot an nih."
22,"And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.","Chun, Levi mi hotu Kenania chu hla hotu a na; a thiem leiin hla chu a ṭhuoi a."
23,And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.,Berekia le Elkana chu bâwm ta dinga kawtkhâr vêngtu an nih.
24,"And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.","Sebania, Josaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zekaria, Benaia le Eliezer, thiempuhai chun, Pathien bâwm hmaa chun tawtawrâwthai an mût a; chun, Obed-edom le Jehia chu bâwm vêngtuhai chu an nih."
25,"So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.","Chuongchun, David le Israel upahai le sâng khat chunga hotuhai chu Obed-edom ina inthawka LALPA thuthlungna bâwm chu hlimtaka hung la dingin an fe tah a;"
26,"And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.",Chuong Levi mihai LALPA thuthlungna bâwm zâwntuhai chu Pathienin a ṭhangpui lei chun bâwng- chal pasari le berâmchal pasariin an inthâwi a.
27,"And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: and David had upon him an ephod of linen.","David chu puon zai inhmi puonin ân thuom a, Levi mihai po po bâwm zâwntuhai le, hlasaktuhai le, hlasaktuhai hotu Kenania hai le chun chuong ang bawkin an inthuom a; David chun zakawsîng puon zai inhmi chu a hâk bawk a."
28,"Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.","Chuongchun, Israelhai po po chun ri nasatak leh, saki mût rîk leh, tawtawrâwt ri leh, dârbenthek ri leh, ṭingṭang le perkhuonghaia inring- taka sakin LALPA thuthlungna bâwm chu an hung lâk tah a."
29,"And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.","Chun, LALPA thuthlungna bâwm chu David khawpui chu a hung tlung chun, Saula naunu Mikal chu tukvera hin a hei dâk a, lal David chu thil sut a, lâmin a hei hmu tah a; chuongchun, a lungril chun a hmusit hle tah a."
