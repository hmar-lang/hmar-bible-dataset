1,"And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah dwelleth under curtains.","Chun, David chun a in chu a hung hluo phing chun, zâwlnei Nathan kuoma chun, “Ngai ta, kei chu Sidar thingphêk inah ka um a. LALPA thuthlungna bâwm ruok chu puon in hnuoiah a um a nih,” a ta."
2,"And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.","Chun, Nathan chun David kuomah, “I lungrila um ang po po chu thaw el rawh, Pathien chu i kuomah a um annâwm,” a ta."
3,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,","Chun, chu zân le le chun Pathien thu chu Nathan kuoma chun a hung tlung tah a,"
4,"Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:","“Hang fe la, ka siehlaw David chu hang hril rawh, ‘LALPA chun hieng hin a ti a nih, chêngna dingin ka ta dingin in mi bâwlpêk naw ti nih;"
5,"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.","Israel thlahai Aiguptaa in- thawka ka hung ṭhuoi suoka inthawk vawisûn ni chen hin inah ka la um ngai nawh a; puon in pakhata inthawka a dangah, biekbûk pakhata inthawka a dangah ka um lem kha."
6,"In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?","Khâwlai hmuna khawm Israel- hai ka fepuina taphawta chun, ka mihai châwm dinga thu ka ipêk, Israel rorêltuhai a tu tu kuoma khawm khan, Iengdinga Sidar in in mi bâwlpêk naw am a na? ka ti hlak am a nih?’"
7,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:","Chuleiin, ka siehlaw David kuoma chun tuhin hang hril la, ‘Sipaihai LALPA chun hieng hin a tih: Ka mi Israelhai chunga lal ni dingin, berâm tlatna hmuna berâm hnung zuinaa inthawk ka lâk suok cheh a;"
8,"and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.","i fena taphawtahai chun ka hung ve pei a, i hmêlmahai po po chu i hmaa inthawkin ka sat thlâkpêk cheh a; chuongchun, leihnuoia um, mi ropuitak hming angin i hming chu siem ka tih."
9,"And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,","Ka mi Israelhai ta ding chun hmun ruot ka ta, anni chu phun ka tih, anni hmun ngeia chun an um a, an insawn nâwk ta nawna dingin. Chun, inhma ang khan rîtlona thla- hai chun anni chu sukse ta naw nih,"
10,and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.,"ka mi Israelhai chunga um dinga rorêltuhai ka ruot nia ang khan; chun, i hmêlmahai po po chu tukdawl bawk ka tih. Chunawa khawm, LALPA chun sûngkuo siem- pêk a che ti hi ka hril che a nih."
11,"And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.","Chun, i thlatuhai kuoma i fena ding nihai a hung bikim pha chun, nangma hnunga hin i thla ngei hung inngîr ka ta, chu chu i naupasalhai laia mi ngei nîng a tih, chun, a ram chu sukdet bawk ka tih."
12,"He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.",Ama chun in mi bâwlpêk a ta; kei khawma a ram chu kumkhuoin tungdingpêk bawk ka tih.
13,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;","A pa nîng ka ta, ama chu ka naupa nîng a tih; i hmaa umpa kuoma inthawka ka lâk hmang ang khan amaa inthawk chun ka zângaina chu la hmang naw ningah;"
14,but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.,"amiruokchu, ka ina le ka ramah kumkhuoin inngîr dettir lem ka tih; chuongchun, a lalṭhungpha chu chatuonin tungding nîng a tih,’” tiin."
15,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.","Hieng thu po pohai ang tak le, hieng thilhmu po po ang tak hin Nathan chun David chu a hril tah a."
16,"Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?","Chun, lal David chu a lût a, LALPA hmaa chun a ṭhung tah a; chun, ama chun, “Aw LALPA Pathien, tu am ka na, ka insûng khawm ieng am a ni hrim a, hieng chen lâwm lâwm i mi ṭhuoi hi?"
17,"And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.","Hi hi i mithmua chun thil chîtê a na, aw Pathien, nisienlakhawm, i siehlaw sûngkuo chunga thil la hung tlung ding thu chu i hril a, Aw LALPA Pathien, mi lien ang elin i ngai hi;"
18,What can David say yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.,"i siehlaw chawimawia a um chungthua hin, hi bâk hi David hin ieng am i kuoma la hril sa rawp a ta? I siehlaw chu i hriet chieng sih a."
19,"O Jehovah, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.","Aw LALPA, i siehlaw lei le, nangma lungril puoksuok ang peiin, hieng thil ropuitakhai hi inhriettir dingin, hieng thil ropui po po hi i thaw ta hi."
20,"O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.","Aw LALPA, nanga ang tu- khawm an um nawh a, nang Pathien naw chu a dang an um nawh, kan nahaia kan hriet ta ang peiin."
21,"And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemedst out of Egypt?","Aigupta rama inthawka i mihai an hmaa hnamhai chu hnawt suok peia în tlan suok, thil râpthlâk le thil ropuia i hming siempêk dinga, nang- ma ta ding ngeia nang Pathien feha în tlan suok hnam, i mi Israelhai ang hnuoi chunga hin ieng hnam am an um hrim a?"
22,"For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.",I mi Israelhai chu nangin i mi- hai ngei ni kumkhuo dingin i siem a; nang LALPA chu an Pathien i ni sih a.
23,"And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.","Tuhin, Aw LALPA, i siehlaw chungthua le a insûng chungthua i hrilhai, kumkhuoa dingin hung suk- det la, i hril angtak ngei chun nangin hung thaw bawk rawh."
24,"And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.","‘Sipaihai LALPA chu Israelhai Pathien a na, Israelhai Pathien ngei chu: i siehlaw David sûngkuo khawm chu nangma hmaa sukdet a nih,’ tiin, i hming chu tungdinga kumkhuoa chawimawi ni raw se."
25,"For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray before thee.","Aw ka Pathien, nangin i siehlaw kuoma hin sûngkuo i siempêk ding a nih ti i suklang ta sih a; chuleiin,i siehlaw hin i hmaa a lungrila ṭawng- ṭai dingin a lo ngam tah a nih."
26,"And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:","Chun, tuhin, Aw LALPA, nang chu Pathien i na, hieng thil ṭhahai hi i siehlaw kuoma hin i lo tiem tah a;"
27,"and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.","chuongchun, tuhin i hmaa kum- khuoa a um zing theina dingin i sie- hlaw sûngkuo chu malsâwmpêk hi i lawmzâwngtak a na; Aw LALPA, nang chun mal i sâwm tah a, kumkhuoa dinga malsâwm a ni ta sih a,” tiin."
