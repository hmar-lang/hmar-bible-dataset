1,"And David the king said unto all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God.","Chun, lal David chun mipui inkhâwmhai po po kuoma chun, “Ka naupa Solomon Pathienin ama ngei a hung thlang hi, a la naupangin a la dâwng a, sin hlak chu a nasa hle a; a in chu mihriem ta ding ni loin, LALPA Pathien ta ding a ni sih a."
2,"Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.","Tuhin, ka Pathien in ta ding chun ka thei ang tâwp po po chu ka lo buotsai tah a; rângkachak thilhai dinga chun rângkachak, tangkaruo thilhai dinga chun tangkaruo, dârsen thilhai dinga chun dârsen dâm, thîr thilhai dinga chun thîr dâm, thing thilhai dinga chun thing dâm, berul lunghai, lung inbûk dinghai, lung a phûma phûm dinghai le, ze tum tum dinghai dâm, lunghlu chi tinrênghai le sailungvâr chihai leh; tam tâwk takin."
3,"Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,","Chu nawa khawm chun, ka Pathien in dinga ditsakna tak ka nei leiin, rângkachak le tangkaruohai keima ta ngei siekhawl ka nei ti ka hmu chun, chu in inthieng ta dinga ka buotsaihai po po bâka chun, ka Pathien in ta ding chun ka pêk sa bawk a;"
4,"even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses;","chu chu rângkachak talent sâng thum, Ophir rângkachak chu; tang- karuo inthieng, a in bang chu sûng- tienga zûtna dingin talent sâng sari: rângkachak thilhaia dingin rângka- chak,"
5,"of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?","tangkaruo thilhaia dingin tang- karuo, themthiemhai kuta siem dinga sin iengkima dinga hmang ding po pohai chu. LALPA kuomah vawi- sûn hin tu am inpumpêk dingin inphaltakin inhlân a ta?” a ta."
6,"Then the princes of the fathers’ houses, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly;","Chun, pahnam laia hotuhai le, Israel hnam laia hotuhai le, za khat le sâng khat pâwl chunga hotuhai leh, lal sin chunga rorêltuhai le chun phaltakin an inpêk tah a."
7,"and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.","Chuongchun, Pathien in rawng- bâwlna ding chun rângkachak talent sâng nga le, darik sîng khat le, tangkaruo talent sîng khat le dârsen talent sîng khat le, sâng riet le, thîr talent nuoi khat an pêk a."
8,"And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.","Chun, lunghlu lo neituhai chun LALPA in ro ina dingin Gerson mi Jehiel kuta chun an pêk bawk a."
9,"Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.","Chun, mipuihai chu phaltaka an inhlân lei chun an hlim a, lung- ril tluongtaka LALPA kuoma an inhlân lei chun; chun, lal David ngei khawm chu namênin a lâwm nawh a."
10,"Wherefore David blessed Jehovah before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.","Chuleichun, David chun mipui inkhâwmhai po po hmaa chun LALPA chu ân pâk a; David chun a hril a, “Aw LALPA, kan thlatu Israel Pathien, chatuon chatuonin nang chu inpâkin um la;"
11,"Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and thou art exalted as head above all.","Aw LALPA, ropuina dâm, thil- thawtheina dâm, chawimawina dâm, hnena dâm, inlalna dâm i ta an na; hnuoi le vâna um po pohai chu i ta an ni vawng sih a; Aw LALPA, lalram chu nangma ta a na, mi po po chungah nang chu lu anga chawi- mawiin i um hi."
12,"Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.","Hausaknahai le inzakainahai chu nangmaa inthawka hung suok a na, nang chun mi po po chungah ro i rêl a; nangma kuta chun thilthaw- theina le hrâtna chu a um a; chun, i kuta chun mi tin kuoma hrâtna pêkna ding le sukropuina ding chu a um a."
13,"Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.","Chuleiin, tuhin, kan Pathien, i hming ropui chu kan inpâkin, lâwm- thu kan hril che."
14,"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.","Hieng anga inhâwktaka inhlân theina che kan hung nei hi, kei hi tu am ka na, ka mihai khawm hi tuhai am an na? thil po po chu nangmaa inthawka suok a na, nangma ta ma ma chu kan pêk el che a ni sih a."
15,"For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.",Kan thlatuhai po po ang bawk khan i hmaa hin pêm le mikhuol el kan ni sih a; hi hnuoia hin kan nihai chu hlîm ang el a na; tukhawm um sawng hrim khawm an um nawh.
16,"O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy hand, and is all thine own.","Aw LALPA kan Pathien, i hming inthieng ta dinga in bâwlna dinga hieng kan buotsaihai po po siekhâwm hi nangmaa inthawka hung a na, nangma ta ruok a nih."
17,"I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto thee.","Ka Pathien, nang chun lungril chu i fie hlak a, felnaa chun lâwmna i nei ti khawm ka hriet a. Keia ngai chun, keia lungril tluongtakin hieng thilhai po po hi ka lo inhlân tah a; tuhin, i mihai hitaka umhai hin phaltaka i kuoma inhlân dingin anni chu hlimtakin ka hmu a nih."
18,"O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee;","Aw LALPA, kan thlatuhai Abraham hai, Isak hai, Israel hai Pathien, i mihai lungril ngaituonahai hi kumkhuoa dinga kawl zing dingin; an lungril chu nangmaa chun sukdet rawh;"
19,"and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.","ka naupa Solomon kuoma khawm, i thupêkhai le, i thu inhriet- tirhai le, i thuruothai chu zâwm dingin le, hieng thilhai po po hi thawh a, a châkkhai ka lo sielâwk tahai chun lalin bâwl dingin lungril ṭha famkim pe bawk rawh,” a ta."
20,"And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Jehovah, and the king.","Chun, David chun, mipui in- khâwmhai po po kuoma chun, “Tuhin LALPA in Pathien chu inpâk ro,” a ta. Chuongchun, mipui inkhâwmhai po po chun LALPA an thlatuhai Pathien chu an inpâk a, an luhai an kûn a, lal le LALPA chu chibai an bûk tah a."
21,"And they sacrificed sacrifices unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,","Chun, LALPA kuoma chun, in- thâwinahaiin a zînga chun an inthâwi tah a; LALPA kuoma chun pumrawhmang thilinhlânhai chu an inhlân a; bâwngchal sâng khat, berâmchal sâng khat, berâmte sâng khat, dâwn mi thilinhlânhai leh, Israel mi po po ta dingin tam tâwk zeta inthâwinahai chu an inhlân a;"
22,"and did eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.","chu ni chun hlimna nasatak leh LALPA hmaa chun an dâwnin an fâk tah a. Chun, David naupa Solomon chu a ṭum hninaa chun lal dingin an siem nâwk tah a, ama chu hotu ni dingin le Zadok chu thiempu ding- in LALPA hmaa chun hriek an nâl tah a."
23,"Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.","Solomon chu a pa David ai awin LALPA lalṭhungphaa chun lalah a ṭhung tah a; ama chu a hung butlingin, Israel mi po pohai chun a thu an awi tah a."
24,"And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.","Chun, lalhai po po le, mi thilthawtheitakhai le a naupasalhai po po chu David naupasalhai ang tak khan lal Solomon kuoma chun an intuklût vawng tâwl a."
25,"And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.","Chuongchun, LALPA chun Solomon chu Israel mihai po po mit- hmua chun nasatakin a chawimawi a; Israel rama ama hmaa lal tukhawm chunga um ngai lo, lal inlalna chu ama chunga chun a pêk a."
26,Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.,"Chuongchun, Jesai naupa David chun Israel ram po po chunga chun ro a rêl a."
27,"And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.","Israel chunga ro a rêl sûng chu kum sâwmli a nih; Hebrona khan kum sari ro a rêl a, Jerusalema khan kum sâwmthum le kum thum a rêl a."
28,"And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.","Ama chu upatakin, tarkûnin, hausatak le inzaumtakin a thi tah a; chuongchun, a naupa Solomon chun ama aia chun ro a rêl tah a."
29,"Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,","Chuongchun, lal David thil- thawhai, a hmasa le a nuhnung khawm, zâwlnei Samuel chanchin- bua chun ziekin a um a, zâwlnei Nathan chanchinbua le, zâwlnei Gad chanchinbua khawm chun ziek a nih;"
30,"with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.","rambunghaia lalramhai po po chunga le, Israelhai chunga le ama chunga hun lo liem tahai le, a thilthawtheizie le a rorêlhai po po chu chuonghaia chun ziek an nih."
