1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.","Hieng thilhai hnunga lal Ahasuer lunginsenna chu a hung rê hnunga chun, Vasti le a thilthaw le, a chunga thupêk um chu a hriet zing a."
2,"Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:","Chun, lal siehlaw ama rawng- bâwltu chun thurawt a siem a, “Lal ta ding hin nunghâk tleirawl hmêl ṭhahai zawng ni raw se."
3,"and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;","Susa khawpuia nuhmeihai inah hieng nunghâk tleirawl hmêl ṭhahai po po hung ṭhuoi khâwm dingin lal hin a rambung sûng po poa dingin hotuhai ruot bawk sien. Anni chu nuhmeihai kawltu, lal mitillâk Hegai enkawlna hnuoiah sie ni hai sien; chun, incheimawina hmangruohai pêk ni bawk hai sien."
4,and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.,"Chun, nunghâk lal suklungâwitu chu Vasti aiah lalnu hung ni raw se,” tiin. Chu thil chun lal chu a suklâwm a, chuong ang tak chun a thaw tah a."
5,"There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,","Susa khawpuia chun Juda mi, a hming Mordekai, Benjamin mi Kis naupa, Simei naupa, Jair naupa chu a um a;"
6,"who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.",ama chu Juda lal Jehoiakin ruola Babulon lal Nebukadnezzarin a ṭhuoi hmang sal intânghai ruola Jerusalema inthawka ṭhuoi hmang a ni veh a.
7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.","Ama chun a pami naunu Hadassa, chu chu Esther a nih, chu a châwmlien a, amanu chun nu ama- nih, pa amani khawm a nei si nawh a; chu nunghâk chu hmêl ṭha ditumtak a na; chuongchun, a nu le a pa an thi chun Mordekai chun ama naunu dingin a lâk a nih."
8,"So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.","Chuongchun, lal thupêk le a thu sukthlûk chu hriet a na, nunghâk tamtakhai chu Susa khawpuia Hegai enkawlna hnuoia chun ṭhuoi khâwm an ni phing chun, nuhmei enkawltu Hegai enkawlna hnuoiah lal ina chun Esther khawm chu ṭhuoi a ni ve tah a."
9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king’s house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.","Chu nunghâk chun ama chu a suklâwm a, a lungsietna chu a hlaw tah a; lal chun incheimawina hmang- ruohai le a fâk ding chanpuol chu lal ina mi nunghâk thlang suok pasari leh inhmawtakin a pêk a; nuhmeihai in hmun ṭhatna taka chun ama le a nunghâkhai chu a sie tah a."
10,Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.,Esther chun a chihai le a lai- bunghai khawm ân hriettir nawh a; Mordekai chun inhriettir lo dingin a khap sih a.
11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.","Chun, Esther chu ieng angin am a thawh a, ieng am a chang a ti hre dingin, nuhmei in tuol puoa chun Mordekai chu ni tin hin a fe hlak a."
12,"Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),","Nunghâk chu lal Ahasuer kuom- a a lût hun a tlung hma chun nuhmei- hai ta dinga incheimawina hun ruot thla sâwmpahni a hmang zo ding a na, thla ruk sûng chu mura hriek leh, thla ruk dang chu riminhnik danghai leh."
13,then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: Whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.,"Chun, nunghâk chu lal kuoma a lût dân ding chu hieng ang hi a nih: lal ina va fe dinga nuhmeihai ina a dit zâwng taphawt chu chawi dinga pêk a na."
14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.","Zântieng chun chutaka chun fêng a ta, zingkâr chun nuhmeihai in pahnina, thaikêmhai enkawltu, lal mitillâk Saasgaz enkawlna hnuoia chun hung kîr a ta. Lal chu a chungah a lâwm nawh a, a hminga a ko naw chun lal kuoma chun a kîr nâwk ta ngainaw ding a nih."
15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.","Chuongchun, a naunu dinga ama enkawltu Mordekai pami Abi- hail naunu Esther ta dinga lal kuoma lût hun a hung tlung chun, ieng- khawm a ngên nawh a, nuhmeihai enkawltu, lal mitillâk Hegaiin a ruotpêkhai chau naw chu."
16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.","Chun, a hmu taphawthai mit- hmuah Esther chun ditsakna a hlawh a. Chuongchun, a rorêl kum sarina. Tebeth thla, thla sâwmnaa chun, a lal inah, lal Ahasuer kuoma chun Esther chu ṭhuoi lût a ni tah a."
17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.","Chuongchun, nuhmei danghai po po nêkin lal chun Esther chu a ditzâwng a, nunghâk po pohai nêk chun a mithmua chun lunginsietna le ditsak a hlaw nasa lem a; chuong- chun, a lua chun lallukhum ân khumtir a, Vasti aia chun lalnuah a siem tah a."
18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.","Chun, lal chun a lalhai le a siehlawhai po po ta dingin, ruoi ropuitak, Esther ruoiṭhe, chu a siem tah a, rambunghai ta dingin châwl a siem a, lal tiktlâina ang peiin lâwm- manhai khawm a pêk bawk a."
19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.","Nunghâkhai an hung inkhâwm a vawihninaa chun Mordekai chu lal kul kawtkhâra chun a ṭhung a,"
20,"Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.","Esther chun a sûnghai le a hnam khawm a la hrillang nawh a, Mordekai chun a khap leiin; ama a umpui lai ang bawk khan Esther chun Mordekai thu chu a awi sih a."
21,"In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.","Chuong nihaia Mordekai chu lal in kawtkhâra a ṭhung lai chun, mi tillâk pahni, Bigthan le Teres, kawt- khâr vêngtuhai chu an lunginsen a, lal Ahasuer chunga kut thlâkna ding an zawng a."
22,"And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.","Chu thil chu Mordekai chun a lo hriet a, ama chun lalnu Esther kuoma chun ân hriettir a; chuong- chun, Esther chun Mordekaia hming chun lal chu a hril tah a."
23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.","Chuonga chu thu chu dâwp- suokna siem a hung ni chun, chuong ang ngei chu a ni ti hmusuok a ni tah a, anni chu thinga khai hlum an ni ve ve tah a; chun, lal hmaa chun lal chanchin ziekna bua chun ziek a ni nghe ngheh a."
