1,"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them (whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them),","Chun, thla sâwmpahnina, Adar thlaa ni sâwmpathum nia, lal thupêk le a thu sukthlûk chu thaw ding ni a hung hnai chun, chuong nia Juda hmêlmahaiin an chunga ro nei an beisei huna chun; a naw zâwngin a hung um ta thut a, Judahai chun anni theidatuhai chunga chun ro an nei lem tah a;"
2,"the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples.","anni suknat tumtuhai chunga kut thlâk dingin, lal Ahasuer ram- bung po poa chun Judahai chu an khawpuihaia chun an inko khâwm tâwl a; tukhawma an dang zo si nawh a, anni ṭitna chu hnam po pohai chunga chun a tlung ta sih a."
3,"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king’s business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them.","Chun, rambunghaia lalhai le, ram awptuhai le, rorêltuhai le lal sin thawtuhai chun Judahai chu an ṭhangpui a; Mordekai ṭina chu an chunga chun a um tlat ta leiin."
4,"For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.","Mordekai chu lal ina chun ropui- tak a ni sih a, a chanchin chu ram- bung po poa chun ân thang a; chu Mordekai chu a hung inṭhang lien tiel tiel el sih a."
5,"And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them.","Chuongchun, Judahai chun an hmêlmahai po po chu kâwlhnâma sâtin an sât hlum tâwl a, suksietna le thatnain anni theidatuhaiin an chunga an thaw ding ang tak chun an thaw tah a."
6,And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.,Lal khawpui Susaa ngei khawm Judahai chun mi za nga an sukbo- hmang a.
7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,","Chun, Parsandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha;"
8,"and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,","Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha;"
9,"and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,","Parmasta, Arisai, Aridai le Vaizatha hai;"
10,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.","Judahai hmêlma Hammedatha naupa Haman naupasal sâwmhai khawm chu an that a; amiruokchu, râllâk suma ruok chun an kut an rawl nawh a."
11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.,Chu ni chun Susa khawpuia thata umhai nizât chu lal kuoma chun hung lâk a na.
12,"And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.","Chun, lal chun lalnu Esther kuoma chun, “Judahai chun Susa khawpuia hin mi za nga le Haman naupasalhai sâwm an thatin an sukbohmang ta a nih; lal rambung danghaia chun ieng ang khieuin am an thaw ding chu. Tuhin i hnina chu ieng am a na? Phalpêk ning i tih; annawleh, ieng am a na i la hni rawp ding? Thaw ni bawk a tih,” a ta."
13,"Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.","Chun, Esther chun, “Lal ṭhati zâwng a ni chun, vawisûna thupêk ang bawk hin, Susaa Juda umhai chu zinga khawm thaw dinga phal ni hai sienla, Haman naupasal sâwmhai chu khaihlumnahaia chun khai kâng ni raw hai se,” a ta."
14,And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.,"Chun, lal chun chuong anga thaw ding chun thu a pêk a, Susaa inthawk chun thupêk chu pêk suok a ni tah a; chuongchun, Haman naupa- sal sâwmhai chu an khâi kâng tah a."
15,"And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.","Chun, Adar thla ni sâwmpali ni khawm chun Susaa Juda mi umhai chu an inkei khâwm a, Susaa chun mi za thum an that a; nisienlakhawm, râllâk suma ruok chun an kut an rawl nawh a."
16,"And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.","Chun, lal rambung danga Juda umhai khawm chu anni le anni chu an inkei khâwm tâwl a, an hringna sanin an ngîr a, an hmêlmahaia in- thawk chun râlmuongin an um a, anni theidâtuhai sîng sari le sâng nga an that a; amiruokchu, annia râllâk sum chu an lâk nawh a."
17,"This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.","Adar thla ni sâwmpathum ni chun hi hi thaw a ni tah a; chun, chu thla ma ni sâwmpali ni chun an châwl a, lâwmna le ruoiṭhena niin an hmang a."
18,"But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.","Amiruokchu, Susaa Juda mi umhai chu, chu thla ni sâwmpathum ni le sâwmpali ni khawm chun an inkhâwm a; chu thla ma ni sâwm- panga ni chun an châwl a, lâwmna le ruoiṭhena niin an hmang a."
19,"Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.","Chuleiin, khaw kul neiloa um- hai Juda khuoa mihai chun Adar thlaa ni sâwmpali ni chu lâwmna le ruoiṭhena le, ni ṭhaa le, thilpêk inthawn niah an hmang tah a."
20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,","Chun, Mordekai chun hieng thilhai hi a ziek a, lal Ahasuer ram- bung po poa Juda um po pohai kuomah, a hla le hnaia khawm,"
21,"to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,",Adar thla ni sâwmpali ni le ni sâwmpanga ni hi kum tinin inser dinga sukdet dingin lekhathawnhai ân phur tah a;
22,"as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.","chuong nihaia chun Juda mihai chun an hmêlmahaia inthawka châwl an neina nihai a ni lei le, chu thla chu an ta dinga lungngaina lâwmnaa inchangna le ṭapna ni ṭhaa inchang- na thla a ni leiin: hlimna le ruoiṭhena ni, chanvohai inphurtuona ni le, mi pasiehai kuoma thilpêkhai pêkna nihaiah an nei ding thu a pêk a."
23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;","Chuongchun, Juda mihai chun, Mordekaiin an kuoma a ziek ang ngei le, an lo ṭan ta ang chun thaw dingin an nei tah a;"
24,"because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;","Agag mi Hammedatha naupa Haman, Judahai po po hmêlmapa chun, anni sukbohmang dingin a lo phierrûk a, anni sukbohmanga suk- chimit dingin Pur, chu chu aisân a nih, a lo sân tah a;"
25,"but when the matter came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.","amiruokchu, chu thil chu lal kuom a hung tlung chun, a dawhâ ṭha lotak, Judahai chunga dawhâ a nei chu, ama lu chung ngeiah a tla lem ding a nih tiin lekha ziekin thu a pêk a, ama le a naupasalhai ngei khawm chu khaihlumnahaia chun khai kâng an ni ding a nih, tiin."
26,"Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them,","Chuleiin, hieng nihai hi Pur hming chawi chun Purim an lo inbûk tah a. Chuleiin, chu lekha thuziek po po lei le, chu chungthua an ihmu ta ang lei le, an chunga thil hung tlung- na lei chun,"
27,"the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year;","Judahai chun, anni le an thla- hai le anni hung sûngkhattuhai po po chunga chun belin, an namdet tah a; kum tinin chutaka a ni ruot ang tak le, chutaka ziek ang taka chu ni hni- hai chu insera bâwpel ngai hlek lo dingin;"
28,"and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed.","khaw tina le rambung tina le sûngkaw tinah, suon po po chenin hi nihai hi hriet zinga inser ding a na; hieng Purim nihai hi Juda mihai laia chun bâwpel a ni ngai ding a ni nawh a, an thlahai laia chun hriet zing an nina hi a bohmang bawk naw ding a nih."
29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.","Chun, Abihail naunu, lalnu Esther le Juda mi Mordekai chun hi Purim lekha pahnina hi sukdet ding- in thuneitakin an ziek tah a."
30,"And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,","Chun, Juda mi po pohai kuom- ah, Ahasuer lalram, rambung za sâwmhni pasaria chun, thudik le thlamuonna thuhai le chun lekha- thawnhai chu a thawn tah a;"
31,"to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.","Juda mi Mordekai le lalnu Estherin anni an ruotpêk ang le, an ṭap khêk râwl le an bungheina chungthua an thlahai le anni ta dinga an ruotpêk ang ngeia, hieng Purim nihai hi a hun ruothaia sukdet dingin."
32,And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.,"Chun, Esther thupêk chun hi Purim chungthu hi a sukdet a; lekha- bua chun ziek a ni tah a."
