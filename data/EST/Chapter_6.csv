3,"And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.","Chun, lal chun, “Hi hi ding hin Mordekai chunga chun ieng chawi- mawina le insângna am siem a ni tah a?” a ta.

4,"And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.","Lal chun, “Tu am a na tuollaia um saw?” a ta. Chulaitak chun, Haman chu ama ta dinga a buotsai khaihlumnaa Mordekai chu khai- hlum ding thu hril dingin, lal tuollai puo lema chun a hung lût a."
5,"And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.","Chun, lal siehlawhai chun a kuomah, “Ngai ta, Haman chu tuol- laia saw a ngîr zing ie,” an ta. Lal chun, “Hung inlûttir ro,” a ta."
6,"So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?","Chuongchun, Haman chu a hung lût tah a. Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Lalin chawimawi a nuom mi kuoma chun ieng anga thaw ding am nîng a ta?” a ta. Chuongchun, Haman chun a lungrilin, “Kei naw chu lal hin tu dang am chawimawi nuom a ta?” a ta."

8,"let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:","lalin a sil hlak lal puon le, lal chuongna hlak sakawr, a lua lallu- khum khum chu hung lâk ni sienla;"
9,"and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.","chun, ‘Lalin mi a chawimawi nuom chunga chun hienga thaw hi a ni ding a nih,’ tia, a hmaa khêk a, kawtthlêra chun sakawr chunga in- chuongtir a, lalin chawimawi a nuom mi chu an inthuomtir vawng theina dingin lal mi ṭhatakhai laia pakhat kutah sakawr le silfên chu pêk ni raw se,” a ta."
10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.","Chun, lal chun Haman kuoma chun, “Inhmaw la, i hril ang chun lal silfên le sakawr chu la la, lal kul kawtkhâr bula ṭhung, Juda mi Mor- dekai chunga chun va thaw rawh; i hril ang ta po po chu iengkhawm kimlo um hlek loin,” a ta."
11,"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.","Chuongchun, Haman chun lal silfên le sakawr chu a lâk a, Mordekai chu a thuom a, “Lalin mi a chawi- mawi nuom chunga chun hienga thaw hi a ni ding a nih,” tia khêk peiin, kawtthlêra chun ân chuongtir tah a."

13,"And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.","Chun, Haman chun a nuhmei Zeres le a ruolhai po po kuoma chun a chunga thil hung tlunghai chu a hril nâwk tah a. A mi varhai le a nuhmei Zeres chun a kuomah, “Mordekai, a hmaa i tlûkna chu, Juda chia mi a ni hrim hrim chun, ama chu ngam naw ti ni, a hmaa chun tlu ngei lem i tih,” an ta."
14,"While they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.","Chuonga ama an biek zing lai chun, lal vêngtuhai chu an hung a, Estherin a buotsai thlaithlêng awt ding chun Haman chu an ṭhuoi tah a."
