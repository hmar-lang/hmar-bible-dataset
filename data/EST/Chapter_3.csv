1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.","Hieng thil hnunga hin lal Aha- suer chun Agag mi Hammedatha naupa Haman chu ân kaisângtir a, ama chu a siesâng a, a ṭhunghmun chu ama ruolpui milienhai po po chunga chun a sieh a."
2,"And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence.","Chuongchun, lal siehlaw, lal kul kawtkhâra um hlakhai po po chun Haman chu chibai an bûk a, an inza êm êm hlak a; ama chungthua chun lal chun chuong ang ding chun thu a pêk hrim a ni sih a. Amiruokchu, Mordekai chun chibai a bûk nawh a, ama chu inzâ khawm ân zâ bawk nawh a."
3,"Then the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?","Chuongchun, lal siehlaw, lal kul kawtkhâra umhai chun Mordekai kuoma chun, “Iengdinga lal thupêk i bawsiet am a na?” an ta."
4,"Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.","Ni tinin ama chu an hril a, anni chu a ngai naw phing chun hieng hi a hung na, Haman kuoma chun Morde- kai chungthu chu a ngaimaw le maw naw hrietna dingin an hril a, ama chun Juda mi a ni ti anni a lo hril ta sih a."
5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.","Chun, Hamanin Mordekai chun ama chu chibai a bûk nawh a, inza khawm ân za nawh ti a hriet chun, Haman chu a lunginsen ta êm êm el a."
6,"But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.","Nisienlakhawm, ama chun Mordekai chung chaua kut thlâk chu inzâpuiumah a ngai a; Mordekai chipuihai ngei chu ama an lo inhriettir ta sih a; chuongchun, Haman chun Ahasuer ramawp sûng po poa, Juda mihai po po, Mordekai chipuihai ngei chu sukbohmangna ding a zawng tah a."
7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.","Lal Ahasuer inlal kum sâwm pahnina, thla khatna, Nisan thlaa chun, ni tin tin le thla tin tin hin, thla sâwm pahnina, Adar thla chen chun Haman hmaa chun Pur, chu chu aisân a nih, an sân hlak a."
8,"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.","Chun, Haman chun lal Ahasuer kuoma chun, “I ram sûng rambung po poa mihai laia indara umdar chi khat an um a nih; an dânhai chu mi dang- hai dân hrim hrima inthawkin a danglam bîk rieu a, lal dânhai khawm hi an zâwm chuong bawk nawh a; chuleiin, anni ngaithei zing hi lal ta dinga ṭhathnemna a ni nawh."
9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.","Lal remti zâwng a ni chun, anni chu sukbohmang ding an nih tia ziek hi ni el raw se; chun, keiin lal sum inhaia an hung sie dingin lal sin- thawnaa enkawltuhai kuta chun tangka talent sîng khat pêng ka tih,” a ta."
10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.","Chun, lal chun a kuta kutsebi chu a lâk a, Judahai hmêlma, Agag mi Hammedatha naupa Haman kuoma chun a pêk tah a."
11,"And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.","Chun, lal chun Haman kuoma chun, “Nangin an chunga ṭha i ti ang anga thaw dingin mihai le tangka khawm chu i kuoma pêk a nih,” a ta."
12,"Then were the king’s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king’s ring.","Chun, thla khatna, ni sâwmpa- thum ni chun lal lekhaziektuhai chu ko an ni tah a, chi tinhai lalhai kuoma le, rambung tina rorêltuhai kuoma le, lal ram awptuhai kuoma chun Hamanin thu a pêk ang taphawt chun lekha chu ziek a ni tah a, rambung tinah chutaka inziek ang tak le, chi tin kuomah an ṭawng ang ngeiin; lal Ahasuer hminga ziek a na, lal kutsebi ngeia namdet a ni bawk a."
13,"And letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.","Adar thla, thla sâwmpahnina, ni sâwmpathum ni ngeia, ni khat sûnga, Juda mi po po, naupang le upa, nuhmei le, naupangtehai khawm, sukchimit vawng ding le, sukhlum ding le sukbohmang vawng ding le annia inthawka râllâk sum chu lâk el dingin, lal rambung po poa chun lekhahai chu dâka thawn a ni tah a."
14,"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.","Lekhaziek chu thupêk rambung tina thawn dar ding chu, chu ni ngeia an lo inzosa hieu theina dingin mi po pohai kuoma chun sutsuok a ni tah a."
15,"The posts went forth in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.","Lekhathawn phurnahai chu lal thupêkin inhmâwtakin a fe suok tah a; chun, thupêk chu Susa khawpuia inthawka siem a ni bawk a: chun, lal le Haman chu zu dâwn dingin an ṭhung a, Susa khawpui sûng ruok chu buoi namênin a buoi nawh a."
