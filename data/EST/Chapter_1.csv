1,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),","Ahasuer hun lai chun hieng hi a hung na, (hi Ahasuer hi Indiaa inthawka Ethiopia chena, rambung za sâwmhni pasari chunga rorêltu a nih),"
2,"that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,","chuong nihaia, lal Ahasuer chu Susa khawpuia, a lalram lalṭhung- phaa a ṭhung laiin,"
3,"in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;","a rorêl a kum thumnaa chun a mi ṭhahai le a siehlawhai po po ta dingin ruoi a ṭheh a; Media le Persia ram thilthawtheihai, mi ṭhahai le lal nau- hai, chu rambunga mihai chu a hmaa chun an um a;"
4,"when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.","chu huna chun ama chun a lal- ram ropuitak hausaknahai le ân lal- zie inzaûmna chu ni tamtak el, ni za khat le sâwmriet sûng zet ân entir a."
5,"And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.","Chun, chuong nihai chu a hung tlungkim chun, lal in huon sûng tuollaia chun, ni sari sûng zet, lal in Susaa um mi lien le mi chinhai po po kuoma chun lal chun ruoi a ṭhe tah a;"
6,"There were hangings of white cloth, of green, and of blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.","puon a vâr, a dum le dumpâwl chu sailungvâr banhaia tangkaruo suonkuola puon zai inhmi a êma khitdea khâiin a um a; sailungvâr sen le a dumpâwl le a vâr le a dum phêk chungah, rângkachak le tangkaruo ṭhungphahai chu rem an nih a."
7,"And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.","Anni chu rângkachak nohaiin dâwn ding chu an pêk a, (chuong rângkachak nohai chu a danglam seng an nih), lal kut ang pei chun, lal uoin chu tam tâwk zetin an pêk bawk a."
8,"And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.","Chun, dâwn dân khawm chu dân ang takin a na; tukhawma an thawlui thei nawh a; lal chun mi tinin mâni nuom tâwk ang senga an thawna dingin a ina manmihai chu mi po po ta dinga vêngtu dingin a ruot a."
9,Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.,Lalnu Vasti khawm chun nuhmeihai ta bîk dingin lal Ahasuer lal ina chun ruoi a ṭheh a.
10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,","Ni sari niha, uoin leia lal lungril chu a hung hlim hle phing chun, Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar le Karkas, lal Ahasuer hmaa rawngbâwl hlakhai, mi tillâk pasari chu,"
11,"to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.","lalnu Vasti chu lallukhum khuma lal hmaa chun hung ṭhuoia, mi ṭhahai le mipuihai chu a hmêl ṭhatzie chu inentir dingin thu a pêk tah a; hang en hin ama hlak chu a hmêl a ṭha hle el bawk sih a."
12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.","Nisienlakhawm, mi tillâkhai kuoma lal thupêk chu lalnu Vasti chun a sêl a, a hung nuom nawh a; chuleiin, lal chu a lunginsen ta êm êm el a, a lunginsen chu a chawk hin a chawk tah a."
13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment;","Chun, lal chun mi varhai, a hunhai hretuhai kuoma chun, (dân le rorêl dân hretuhai po po kuoma chun, hi hi lal thaw dân a ni hrim a:"
14,"and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom),","ama dawta chun Media le Persia mi lien pasari, lal hmêl chu hmu hlak a, lalrama khawm chun a ṭhung hmasatuhai Karsena, Sethar, Admatha, Tarsis, Meres, Marsena le Memukan hai chu an nih.)"
15,"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?","“Lal Ahasuerin mi tillâkhai hmanga a thupêk hi lalnu Vasti hin a thaw ta naw lei hin dân angin ieng anga ei thaw ding am ning a ta,” a ta."
16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.","Chun, lalhai le lal hmaa chun Memukan chun a dawn a, “Lalnu Vasti hin lal chunga chau hin a suksuol a ni nawh a, amiruokchu, lal Ahasuer rambung po poa mipui po po le mi ṭhahai po po chunga khawm a suksuol a nih."
17,"For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.","‘Lal Ahasuer chun lalnu Vasti chu a hmaa hung ṭhuoi dingin thu a pêk a, ama hlak chu a hung si nawh a,’ tiin hril dar a ni pha chun, an pasalhai an mithmua entlêuna ding- in hi lalnu thilthaw hi nuhmei po po chun an hung chîng ve ngei ding a ni hi."
18,And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say the like unto all the king’s princes. So will there arise much contempt and wrath.,"Chuongchun, vawisûna Media le Persia lalnauhai, lalnu thilthaw lo hretuhai chun lalpa mi ṭhahai kuoma chun chuong ang bawkin an ti ve ngei ding a na; chuleiin, inkhingna le lunginsenna nasatak a hung suok ngei ding a ni hi."
19,"If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.","Lal hin ṭha a ti zâwng a ni chun lal kuoma inthawk hin lal thupêk chu suok sienla, ‘lal Ahasuer hmaa hin Vasti hi hung ta ngai hrim hrim naw raw se,’ tiin Media le Persia dân thleng nâwk ngai ta lohai ang chun ziek ni raw seh; chun, lal hin a lalnu nina hi ama nêka ṭha lem mi dang kuomah pe bawk raw se."
20,"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.","Chuongchun, lalin thupêk a siem ding chu a lalram po poa sukdar a ni pha chun (a lien âwm sih a) nuhmeihai po po chun, an pasal, mi lien le mi chînhai kuoma khawm chun inzâna an nei ta ding a nih,” tiin."
21,And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:,"Chu thuhril chun mi lienhai le lal chu a suklâwm a, lal chun Memu- kan thu ang tak chun a thaw tah a;"
22,"for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.","a rambung po poa chun lekha a thawn a, rambung tinah ziek ang tak le, mi chi tin kuomah an ṭawng ang ngei le, pasalin mâni insûng ro chu a phurna ding le, a mihai ṭawng ang ngeia a hrildar theina dingin."
