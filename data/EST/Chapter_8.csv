1,On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.,"Chu ni chun lal Ahasuer chun Judahai hmêlmapa Haman in chu lalnu Esther kuoma chun a pêk tah a. Chun, Mordekai khawm chu lal hmaa chun a hung tah a; Esther chun ama chu a ieng am a ni chu a lo hril ta sih a."
2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.","Chun, lal chun Hamana in- thawka a lâk, a kutsebi chu a lâk thlâk a, Mordekai kuoma chun a pêk tah a. Chun, Esther chun Haman in chu Mordekai chu ân enkawltir tah a."
3,"And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.","Chun, Esther chun lal kuoma chun thu a la hril nâwk a, a ke bulah a bawkkhup a, Agag mi Haman thil sukpawi le, Juda mihai chunga a thil phierrûkna rawt chu siehmang dingin mitthli pumin a ngên a."
4,"Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.","Chun, lal chun rângkachak hmawl chu Esther kuoma chun a lâk kâng a."
5,"And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king’s provinces:","Chuongchun, Esther chu a tho a, lal hmaa chun a ngîr tah a. Chun, ama chun, “Lal ṭha ti zâwng a na, a mithmua hin ditsakna ka chang a, hi thil hi lal kuomah indika ân lang chun, le a mit ka tlung chun, Agag mi Hammedatha naupa Hamanin Juda mi lal rambung po poa umhai sukbo- hmangna dinga a ziek lekhathawnhai chu sukdanglam dinga ziek ni raw se:"
6,for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?,"ka chipuihai chunga chuong thil ṭha naw hung tlung ding chu iengtin am tuor thei ka ta? Annawleh, ka chi le kuonghai suksieta an umna chu ka en ngam ding am a nih?” a ta."
7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.","Chun, lal Ahasuer chun lalnu Esther kuoma le Mordekai Juda mi kuoma chun, “Ngai ta u, Haman in hi Esther kuoma chun ka pêk tah a, ama chu khaihlumnaa chun an khai hlum ta bawk a; Juda mihai chunga a kut ân let leiin."
8,"Write ye also to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.","Chuongchun, ṭha in ti angin, lal hmingin Judahai kuoma chun lekha ziek unla, lal kutsebi hin nam ro; lal hminga lekha ziek a, lal kutsebia nam chu, tukhawma an sukdanglam thei âwm si nawh a,” a ta."
9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.","Chuongchun, chu huna chun, thla thumna, Sivan thla, chu thla ni sâwmhni pathum ni chun lal lekha- ziektuhai chu koin an um tah a; chuongchun, Mordekaiin Juda mihai kuoma thu a pêk ang po poin, ram- bung za sâwmhni pasari, Indiaa inthawka Ethiopia chena rambunga lalhai, rorêltuhai le ram awptuhai kuoma chun, rambung tin kuoma chutaka ziek ang peiin, chi tinhai kuomah an ṭawng ang peiin. Juda mihai kuomah an ṭawng ang pei le an ziek dân ang peiin, ziek a hung ni tah a."
10,"And he wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king’s service, bred of the stud:","Chun, ama chun lal Ahasuer hmingin a ziek a, lal kutsebi chun a nam a, lal sinthawnaa hmang hlak sakawr hrât mi sakawr sâwizawi chunga chuongin, sakawr chungah lekhathawnhai chu dâkah a thawn tah a;"
11,"wherein the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,","chutaka chun lal chun Juda mihai khaw tina umhai chu inkei khâwma, lo invêng him dingin a tih a. Khâwlai rambung le mihai thilthaw- theina khawm, anni sukse tumtuhai po po chu, lo thaw veh a, an nau le têhai le an nuhmeihai khawm lo suk- bohmang ding le, that ding le suk- chimit dingin le, annia inthawka râllâk sumhai khawm lo la ve el dingin a phalpêk a."
12,"upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.","Lal Ahasuer rambung po poah ni khat sûng, Adar thla, thla sâwm pahnina, ni sâwmpathum ni sûng chun chu;"
13,"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.","Judahai chu an hmêlmahai chunga an phuba la ve dingin chu ni chun an inzosa zing ding a nih ti le, rambung tina thupêk pêk suok dinga ziek, zieksâwng chu chi tinhai kuoma chun ziek suok vawng a ni tah a."
14,"So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king’s service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.","Chuongchun, dâk phur mihai, lal sinthawnaa hmang hlak sakawr hrâthai chunga chuonghai chu, lal thupêk inawr zing chun inhmaw- takin an fe suok tah a; thupêk chu Susa khawpuia inthawka pêk a nih."
15,"And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.","Chun, Mordekai chu lal puon dumpâwl zai inhmi leh, rângkachak lallukhum ropuitak leh, lal silfên dumpâwl le vâra inthuomin lal hmai- hmaa chu a fe suok tah a; chuong- chun, Susa khawpui chu lâwmin a khêk tah a."
16,"The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor.","Chun, Judahai khawm chun var le lâwmna le hlimna le chawimawina chu an chang ta bawk a."
17,"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them.","Chun, rambung tin le khaw tinah, lal thupêk a tlungna taphawta chun, Judahai chun lâwmna le hlimna an nei a, ni ṭha le ruoiṭhena dâm an nei ta bawk a. Chun, chu rama chi tamtakhai laia mi chu Juda an hung ni ve tah a; an chunga chun Juda mihai ṭitna chu a tlung ta sih a."
