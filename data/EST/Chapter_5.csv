1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.","A ni thum ni chun, Esther chu a lal puonin ân thuom a, lal in zâwn tak, lal in tuollai sûnghnung lema chun a ngîr tah a; lal khawm chu in lûtna zâwn takah, lal ina lalṭhung- phaa chun a ṭhung a."
2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.","Chun, lalnu Esther chu tuollaia ngîr a hmu chun, a mithmua chun ditsakna a hlaw tah a; chuongchun, lal chun rângkachak hmawl a kuta a chawi chu Esther kuoma chun a lâk kâng tah a. Chuongchun, Esther chu a hung hnai a, rângkachak hmawl hmawr chu a them tah a."
3,"Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.","Chun, lal chun a kuomah, “Ieng am i dit a, lalnu Esther, ieng am a na i hni chu? Ram chenve rau khawm ni sien i kuoma pêk nîng a tih,” a ta."
4,"And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.","Esther chun, “Lal hin ṭha a ti zâwng a ni chun, a ta dinga thlai- thlêng vawisûna ka buotsai hi, fa dingin lal le Haman chu hung raw hai se,” a ta."
5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.","Lal chun, “Esther hril ang ngeia thaw a ni theina dingin Haman chu hung inhmâwtir ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, lal le Haman chu Estherin thlaithlêng a buotsaia chun an hung tah a."
6,"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.","Chun, lal chun uoin dâwn huna chun Esther kuoma chun, “I hnina chu ieng am a na? I kuomah phal a ni ngei ding a nih, i ngên khawm chu ieng am a na? Ram chenve rau khawm ni sienla thaw nîng a tih,” a ta."
7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:","Esther chun a dawn a, “Ka hnina le ka ngênna chu;"
8,"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.","lal mithmua hin ditsak tlâk ka ni a, ka hnina hi phal ding le ka ngênna hi thaw dinga lal ṭhati zâwng a ni chun, an ta dinga thlaithlêng ka buotsai dinga hin lal le Haman hi hung ngei raw hai se; chun, chu chu lalin a hril ta angin zînga hin hril ka tih,” tiin."
9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.","Chu ni chun Haman chu lungril lâwmtak le hlimtak chun a fe suok tah a; nisienlakhawm, lal kul kawt- khâra chun ama ta dinga châng loa, a ngîr khawm lo ngîr lo Mordekai a hmu chun, Mordekai chungah nasa- takin a lunginsen tah a."
10,"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.","Nisienlakhawm, Haman chu ân sûm a, a inah a fe tah a; mi a tir a, a ruolhai le a nuhmei Zeres a ko tah a."
11,"And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.","Chuongchun, Haman chun an kuoma chun, a hausaknahai ropuizie dâm, a nauhai tamzie dâm, lalin ama chu ân kaisângtirna thilhai po po dâm, lal siehlawhai le lalhai chunga ama a siechungzie dâm chu a hril tah a."
12,"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king.","Chu naw khawm chu, Haman chun, “Anih, lalnu Esther chun kei ti chau lo chu lal le thlaithlêng a buotsai awt dingin tukhawm a fiel ngai naw bawk a; chuongchun, zinga khawm hin kei chu lal leh fiel ka nih a."
13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.","Anachu lal kul kawtkhâra Juda mi Mordekai ṭhunga ka hmu sûng phawt chu hieng thilhai po po hin a mi sukhawi chuong nawh,” a ta."
14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.","Chun, a nuhmei Zeres le a ruol- hai po po chun a kuomah, “Khaihlum- na tawng sâwmngaa insâng inphun- tir la, chun a zinga chun, chutaka chun Mordekai chu khai hlum ni raw se, tiin lal chu hril la; chuongchun, lal le chun thlaithlêng awtnaa chun hlimtakin um el la a ni el annâwm,” an tih a. Chun, chu thil chun Haman chu a suklâwm tah a; chun, khai- hlumna chu ân phuntir tah a."
