1,"Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;","Mordekaiin chuong thil thawa umhai po po a hriet chun, Morde- kai chun a puonhai a keithlêr a, vut laia saiip puon silin, khawpui kawt- thlêra chun a fe suok a, râwl inring- taka khêkin, lungsetakin a ṭap a;"
2,and he came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter within the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.,"lal kul kawtkhâr hmaa ngei khawm chun a hung a, saiip puon silin tukhawm lal kul kawtkhâr chu an lût thei ngai naw hrim a na."
3,"And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.","Chun, rambung tin elah, lal thupêk le a thu sukthlûk a tlungna taphawta chun, Judahai laia chun lungngaina nasatak el le bungheina dâm le, ṭapna le inrûmna dâm chu a um tah a; tamtak lem chu saiip puon silin pilvut chungah an zâl a."
4,"And Esther’s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.","Esther nunghâkhai le a vêng- tuhai chu a kuomah an hung a, ama chu an hril a; chuongchun, lalnu khawm chu nasatak elin a lungngai tah a; a saiip puon chu lâk hmangpêk a, Mordekai chu insiltir dingin silfên- hai a thawn a; nisienlakhawm, ama ruok chun a lo lâk nawh a."
5,"Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.","Chun, Esther chun, lal vêngtu pakhat, amanu vêngtu dinga lalin a iruot Hathak chu a ko a, hi thil hi ieng am a na, ieng lei am a ni leh ti hre dingin Mordekai kuoma chun fe dingin a tir tah a."
6,"So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king’s gate.","Chuongchun, Hathak chu lal kawtkhâr puoa khawpui khawlai- dunga chun Mordekai kuomah a va fe tah a."
7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.","Mordekai chun a chunga thil hung tlung po po le anni sukbo- hmangna dinga, Judahai ta dinga lal sum inhaia Hamanin sum pêk a tiem zât char chu a hril a."
8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.","Anni sukbohmang dinga Susaa inthawka thupêk pêk suoka um chu Esther kuoma inen- tira, ama kuoma chun hrilfie dingin a pêk bawk a; chun, a chihai ta dinga lal kuoma chun fe a, a kuoma chun ngênna siem a, a hmaa chun hni dingin phût a ni bawk a."
9,And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.,"Hathak chu a hung a, Mordekai thuhai po po chu Esther chu a hril tah a."
10,"Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai, saying:","Esther chun Hathak kuoma chun thu a hril a, Mordekai kuoma chun thucha ân phur a;"
11,"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.","“Tukhawm, nuhmei ni sien, pasal ni sien khawm, ko ni si loa, lal tuollai sûnghnung lema hung lût ta ding chun, ama chu hring a tih, tia lalin a rângkachak hmawl chu a lo lâk kâng si naw chun dân pakhat chau, ama chu that ngei nîng a tih, ti dân hi a um a nih ti lal siehlawhai po po le, lal rambunga mihai po po chun an hriet chieng hleh a; nisienlakhawm, kei chu hieng ni sâwmthum sûng hin lal kuoma lût dinga koin ka um dêr nawh a,” tiin."
12,And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.,"Chun, Esther thuhai chu Mordekai chu an hril a."
13,"Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.","Mordekai khawm chun a dawn- na chu Esther kuoma chun ân phur- kîrtir nâwk a, “Juda mihai po po pumpel naw chu, lal ina nang khan pumpel bîk dingin inngaituo naw rawh."
14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father’s house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?","Hi hi huna i to ṭawk ṭawk a, Judahai ta dinga himna le sansuokna hmun danga inthawkin a hung suok khawmin, nang le i pa sûngkuo chu bohmang tho ei tih; hieng ang lai huna ding hin a ni el thei i sawnnaw, lal nina i chang hi,” tiin."
15,"Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,","Chun, Esther chun Mordekai kuomah a dawnna chu ân phurkîr nâwk a."
16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.","“Fe la, Susaa Juda mi umhai po po chu kei khâwm rawh; chun, ka ta dingin bu nghei unla; sûn le zânah, ni thum sûng chu fain dâwn hlek naw ro, ka nunghâkhai le kei khawma chuong ang bawk chun nghei kan ta; chuongchun, dân lo ang ni sien khawm lal kuoma chun lût el ka ta; ka bohmang leh ka bohmang ni el raw se,” tiin."
17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.","Chuongchun, Mordekai chu a feh a, Estherin thu a pêk ang pei chun a thaw tah a."
