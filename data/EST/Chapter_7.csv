1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.,"Chuongchun, lal le Haman chu lalnu Estherin thlaithlêng a buotsai chu an awt tah a."
2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.","Chun, uoin dâwn huna a ni hni ni chun lal chun Esther kuoma chun, “I hnina ieng am a na, lalnu Esther? Phalpêk ni ngei i tih, i ingên chu ieng am a na? Ram chenve rau khawm ni sienla thaw pei nîng a tih,” a ti nâwk a."
3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:","Chun, lalnu Esther chun a dâwn a, “I mithmua hin ditsak tlâk ka na, aw lalpa, lal ṭhati zâwng a ni chun; ka ingêna hin ka chipuihai le, ka ihnia hin keima hringna ngei hi hla ni el raw se:"
4,"for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s damage.","sukchimit ding le, that ding le, sukbohmang ding sa, kei le ka chipuihai hi zawr kan ni ta sih a. Amiruokchu, siehlawpahai, siehlaw- nuhai ding ang dâma zawr ni inlang chu, lal sietna ding chu hmêlma chun a thung zo naw ding khawma, ka to ṭawk ṭawk ding a na,” a ta."
5,"Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?","Chun, lal Ahasuer chun a biek a, lalnu Esther kuoma chun, “Chuong ang thil a lungrila thaw ngam chu khawlai am a um a? Ama chu tu am a na?” a ta."
6,"And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.","Esther chun, “Hmêlma le khing- pui chu hi mi rilotak Haman hi a nih,” a ta. Chuongchun, Haman chu lal le lalnu hmaa chun a ṭi tah a."
7,And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.,"Chun, lal chu a lunginsen chun uoin dâwn lai chu a tho a, lal in huona chun a va fe tah a; chun, lalnu Esther kuoma a hringna ta dinga ngên dingin Haman khawm chu a ngîr tah a; a chunga chun thiltum ṭha nawtak lal chun a nei ti a hmu ta sih a."
8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.","Chun, lal chu lal in huona in- thawk chun uoin dâwnna hmuna chun a hung kîr nâwk a; Esther umna ṭhungpha chunga chun Haman chu a bawkkhup a. Chun, lal chun, “Ina hin ka hmaa ngei khawm lalnu chu a sukpawrche ding a ni maw?” a ta. Lal baua inthawka thu a hung suok ta lei chun, Haman hmai chu an inkhum tah a."
9,"Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon.","Chun, lal hmaa um hlak, mi tillâkhai laia mi pakhat Harbona chun, “Ngai ta, lal ta dinga thu ṭha hriltu Mordekai ta dinga khaihlumna tawng sâwmngaa insâng Hamanin a siem chu, Haman ina khun ân phun a nih,” a ta."
10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.,"Chun, lal chun, “Chutaka chun ama kha khai hlum ro,” a ta. Chuong- chun, Mordekai ta dinga khaihlumna a buotsaia chun Haman chu an khai hlum tah a. Chun, lal lunginsen chu a hung dam tah a."
